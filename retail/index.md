## Set up Retail channels
As you set up your Retail experience, you'll decide how to define and configure your brick and mortar store (called retail store in Dynamics 365 for Operations) and online store operations. 

Each retail store can have its own payment methods, price groups, POS solutions, income accounts and expense accounts, and staff. After you create your retail store, you assign the products that you want the store to carry. You also assign employees, registers, and customers to the store. Finally, you add the new store to an organization hierarchy.

When you create your online store, you must set up components such as assortments, attributes, payment methods, and shipping methods. You can also define prices, promotions, discounts, and shipping terms that are specific to the online store.

## Set up a call center
You can set up a call center as a type of retail channel. In a call center, workers take orders from customers over the phone and create sales orders. To help your workers take orders and handle customer service throughout the order fulfillment process, you can set up what a sales order will contain, how pricing will be controlled, and what data about customers, products, and pricing can be accessed. For each call center, you can also set up users, payment methods, price groups, financial dimensions, and modes of delivery.

## Define your POS and MPOS solutions
Retail Modern POS (MPOS) is a point-of-sale app for PCs, tablets, and phones. Sales staff can process sales transactions, customer orders, and perform daily operations and inventory management with mobile devices anywhere in the store, as well as at PC-based registers. Cloud POS is a browser-based POS. 

There are several components you’ll set up to define the relationships among a store, the POS registers or channels within the store, and the retail peripherals that those registers or channels use to process transactions. You’ll also define the characteristics of a specific instance of the POS, including the hardware profile or setup for retail peripherals that will be used at the register, the store that the register is mapped to, and the visual experience for the user who logs on to that register.
