[!include[banner](includes/banner.md)]


You can study profitability for the top 10 products using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail. 

As part of Dynamics 365 for Retail, users can also study profitability for the top products (10 to 100) across different levels of the organization hierarchy, based on one of the following criteria:

-   Sales amount
-   Quantity
-   Gross profit margin
-   Margin percentage

For this assessment, you can use the out-of-box **Top products** report, which you can open from any of the following locations:

-   **Retail store management** workspace &gt; **Retail** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Top products report**
-   **Category and product management** workspace &gt; **Retail** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Top products report**
-   **Inquiries and reports** section &gt; **Retail** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales reports** &gt; **Top products report**
