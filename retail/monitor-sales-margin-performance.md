# Monitor sales and margin performance

You can monitor sales and margin performance in real time using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.

As part of Dynamics 365 for Operations, users can monitor sales and margin performance in real time across different levels of the organization hierarchy for the following dimensions:

-   Products
-   Categories
-   Discounts
-   Years as time period
-   Registers/terminals
-   Staff/employees
-   Customers
-   Operating units

Additionally, two unique reports that take advantage of hierarchical grid structuring let users monitor sales and margin performance by drilling down from the top category node to individual leaf nodes of the category in the default retail product category hierarchy. Users can also drill-down from the top operating unit to an individual channel in the organization hierarchy that is defined as the default organization hierarchy for retail reporting hierarchy purposes. You can open the reports from any of the following locations:

-   **Retail store management** workspace Dynamics 365 for Operations &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports**
-   **Category and product management** workspace Dynamics 365 for Operations &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Product and categories** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports**
-   **Pricing and discount management** workspace Dynamics 365 for Operations &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Pricing and discounts** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports**
-   **Inquiries and reports** section Dynamics 365 for Operations &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales reports**
