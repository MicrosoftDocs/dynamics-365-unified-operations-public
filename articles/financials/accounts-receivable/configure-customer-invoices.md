# Create a customer invoice

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


A **customer invoice for a sales order** is a bill that is related to a sale, and that an organization gives to a customer. This type of customer invoice is created based on a sales order, which includes order lines and item numbers. Item numbers are specified and posted in the ledger. Subledger journal entries aren't available for a customer invoice for a sales order. For more information, see [Create sales order invoices](tasks/create-sales-order-invoices.md).

A **free text invoice** isn't related to a sales order. It contains order lines that include ledger accounts, free-text descriptions, and a sales amount that you enter. You can't enter an item number on this kind of invoice. You must enter the appropriate sales tax information. A main account for the sale is indicated on each invoice line, which you can distribute to multiple ledger accounts by clicking **Distribute amounts** on the **Free text invoice** page. Additionally, the customer balance is posted to the summary account from the posting profile that is used for the free text invoice.

For more information see:

[Create a free text invoice](tasks/create-free-text-invoice.md)

[Create a free text template](tasks/create-free-text-invoice-template.md)

[Assign a free text invoice tempate to a customer](tasks/assign-free-text-invoice-template-customer.md)

[Generate and post recurring free text invoices](tasks/post-recurring-free-text-invoices.md)


A **pro forma invoice** is an invoice that is prepared as an estimate of the actual invoice amounts before the invoice is posted. You can print a pro forma invoice either for a customer invoice for a sales order or for a free text invoice.

## Post and print individual customer invoices that are based on sales orders
Use this process to create an invoice that is based on a sales order. You might do this if you decide to invoice the customer before you deliver the goods or services. 

When you post an invoice, the **Invoice remainder** quantity for each item is updated with the total of the invoiced quantities from the selected sales order. If both the **Invoice remainder** quantity and the **Deliver remainder** quantity for all items on the sales order are 0 (zero), the status of the sales order is changed to **Invoiced**. If the **Invoice remainder** quantity isn't 0 (zero), the status of the sales order remains unchanged, and additional invoices can be entered for it.

You can view the status of the sales orders on the **All sales orders** list page. Use the **Open customer invoices** list page to view the invoices that you posted.

## Post and print individual customer invoices that are based on packing slips and the date
Use this process when one or more packing slips have been posted for the sales order. The customer invoice is based on these packing slips and reflects the quantities from them. The financial information for the invoice is based on the information that is entered when you post the invoice. 

You can create a customer invoice that is based on the packing slip line items that have been shipped to date, even if all the items for a particular sales order haven't yet been shipped. You might do this if, for example, your legal entity issues one invoice per customer per month that covers all the deliveries that you ship during that month. Each packing slip represents a partial or complete delivery of the items on the sales order. 

When you post the invoice, the **Invoice remainder** quantity for each item is updated with the total of the delivered quantities from the selected packing slips. If both the **Invoice remainder** quantity and the **Deliver remainder** quantity for all items on the sales order are 0 (zero), the status of the sales order is changed to **Invoiced**. If the **Invoice remainder** quantity isn't 0 (zero), the status of the sales order remains unchanged, and additional invoices can be entered for it. 

Inventory transactions are updated with the invoice number, and the status in the **Line status** field on the sales order is changed to **Invoiced**. 

View the status of the sales orders in the **All sales orders** list page.

## Consolidate sales orders or packing slips for posting
Use this process when one or more sales orders are ready to be invoiced, and you want to consolidate them into a single invoice. 

You can select multiple invoices on the **Sales order** list page and then use **Generate invoices** to consolidate them. On the **Posting invoice** page, you can change the **Summary order** setting to summarize by order number (where there are multiple packing slips for a single sales order) or by invoice account (where there are multiple sales orders for a single invoice account). Use the **Arrange** button to consolidate sales orders into single invoices, based on the **Summary order** settings.

## Additional settings that change the posting behavior
