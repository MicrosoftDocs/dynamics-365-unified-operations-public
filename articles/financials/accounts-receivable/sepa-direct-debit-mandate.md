# Set up SEPA direct debit mandate

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


A Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) direct debit lets a creditor collect funds from a customer's bank account, provided that the customer has granted a signed mandate to the creditor. The mandate that the customer signs authorizes the creditor to collect a payment and instructs the customer's bank to pay the collection. This topic is organized to show the process for setting up SEPA direct debit mandates.

## Prerequisites
The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

| Category       | Prerequisite                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Country/region | The primary address for the legal entity must be in the following countries/regions: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, or the Netherlands. |

1. Set up a number sequence for direct debit mandates
Each direct debit mandate must have a unique number. Use the **Number sequences** page to create a number sequence for direct debit mandates. You will use this identifier to assign the number sequence to the direct debit mandate system on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.

2. Set up Accounts receivable parameters for direct debit mandates
Use the **Accounts receivable parameters** page to set up parameters for direct debit mandates. To set up the parameters, on the **Direct debit** tab, change the default parameters as you require. Then, on the **Number sequences** tab, update the **Direct debit mandate ID** field with the number sequence that you set up earlier.

3. Set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates
You must set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates. You use this method of payment to query for invoices to generate direct debit payments for. Use the **Methods of payment** page to set up the method of payment. To set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates, you must follow these additional steps for a method of payment:

-   In the **Payment type** field, select **Electronic payment**.
-   Optional: If you expect each of your customers to have multiple mandates, in the **Period** field, select **Invoice**. A separate payment will be created for each invoice, and each payment will use the mandate that is specified for the invoice.
-   Select the **Require mandate** option to create payments by using direct debit mandates. The **Require mandate** option is available only if you select **Electronic payment** in the **Payment type** field.
