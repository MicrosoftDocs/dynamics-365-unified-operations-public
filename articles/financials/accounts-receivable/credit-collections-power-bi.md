# Credit and collections management Power BI content

This topic describes what is included in the **Credit and collections management** Microsoft Power BI content. It explains how to access the Power BI reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.

## Overview

The **Credit and collections management** Power BI content was created for credit and collections managers, and collections clerks. It provides key credit and collections metrics, such as days sales outstanding, balance overdue, credit exposure, and customers that are over their credit limit. It uses transactional data, and provides aggregate views of credit and collections across all companies. It also provides a breakdown per company, customer group, and customer.

This Power BI content consists of 10 report pages:

- Two overview pages (one page for a credit overview and one page for a collections overview)
- Eight details pages that provide details of credit and collections metrics that are sliced and diced across various dimensions

All the amounts are shown in the system currency. You can set the system currency on the **Systems parameters** page.

By default, the credit and collections data for the current company is shown. To see the data across all companies, assign the **CustCollectionsBICrossCompany** duty to the role.

## Accessing the Power BI content
If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017), the **Credit and collections management** Power BI content is shown in the **Customer credit and collections** workspace.

## Reports that are included in the Power BI content

The **CustCollectionsBICrossCompany** Power BI content includes a report that consists of a set of metrics. These metrics are visualized as charts, tiles, and tables. The following table provides an overview of the visualizations in the **CustCollectionsBICrossCompany** Power BI content.

The charts and tiles on all these reports can be filtered and pinned to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure a Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards/). You can also use the export underlying data functionality to export underlying data that is summarized on a visualization.

## Extending the Power BI content
By using the content packs that are available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you can provide great analytics to people who don't sign in to Finance and Operations. You can modify these content packs so that they include other reports or visuals, and then publish the content packs to your Power BI.com tenant for analysis.

You can find the **Credit and collections management** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](../../dev-itpro/analytics/power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md). To watch a demo that shows how to implement the Power BI content, see the [Power BI content from Microsoft and your partners in Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w) Office Mix.

Be sure to download the **Credit and collections management** Power BI content that applies to the version of Finance and Operations that you're using.

## Understanding the data model and entities

The following data is used to fill the report in the **Credit and collections management** Power BI content. This data is represented as aggregate measurements that are staged in the Entity store. The Entity store is a Microsoft SQL Server database that is optimized for analytics. For more information, see [Overview of Power BI integration with Entity store](../../dev-itpro/analytics/power-bi-integration-entity-store.md).
