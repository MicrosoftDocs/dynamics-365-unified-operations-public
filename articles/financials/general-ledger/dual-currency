Dual currency: Changes to reporting currency
============================================

The reporting currency has been ‘repurposed’ to become a second accounting
currency. The changes for dual currency are inherent to the system and cannot be
disabled through a confirmation key or parameter. Because we are treating the
reporting currency like a second accounting currency, changes were made to the
posting logic in how the reporting currency is calculated.

In addition, various modules have been enhanced to track, report, and utilize
the reporting currency in various processes. The impacted modules include
General ledger, Financial reporting, Accounts payable, Accounts receivable, Cash
and bank management, and Fixed assets. After upgrading, there are required steps
that must be completed for the Cash and bank management and Fixed asset modules.
Please read those sections closely to complete the necessary steps.

### Posting – all modules

The posting logic has been changed for all transactions that post to general
ledger. Previously the reporting currency was calculated as follows:

Transaction currency amount -\> Accounting currency amount -\> Reporting
currency amount

For example, a transaction is entered in CAD currency. The CAD amount is
translated to the Accounting currency, which is USD. Then the USD amount is
translated to the reporting currency, which is EUR. This means the exchange
rates must exist between CAD and USD and USD and EUR.

The new calculation is as follows:

Transaction currency amount -\> Accounting currency amount

Transaction currency amount -\> Reporting currency amount

With this change, exchange rates must now exist between CAD and USD and CAD and
EUR.

### Reports and inquiries – impacted modules only

Various reports and inquiries have been updated to show the reporting currency
amounts, in addition to the accounting currency amounts. Not every report and
inquiry has been updated. For example, no changes were made to reports that only
show amounts in the transaction currency.

The changes follow one of two patterns. First, if the report or inquiry had
enough space to show amounts in both the accounting and reporting currency, the
reporting currency amounts were added. If the report or inquiry did not have
enough space to show amounts in both currencies, an option was added for the
user to select which currency they wanted to view.

For various reports and inquiries, logic was also added to suppress the
reporting currency amounts if the reporting currency was the same as the
accounting currency, or if the reporting currency wasn’t defined on the Ledger
for the legal entity.

### Financial journals – impacted modules only

The financial journals, such as the general journal, vendor invoice journal,
etc. have been updated to include additional information on the reporting
currency. First, totals for the voucher and journal are now shown in the
reporting currency. We also added the reporting currency’s exchange rate
information on the General tab of the journal Lines, allowing you to override
the reporting currency’s exchange rate during transaction entry.

Module changes
--------------

The following modules have been enhanced to utilize the reporting currency as a
second accounting currency:

-   General ledger

-   Financial reporting

-   Accounts payable

-   Accounts receivable

-   Cash and bank management

-   Fixed assets

### General ledger

If a reporting currency is defined on the Ledger, the general ledger already
tracked reporting currency amounts on every accounting entry but is now
translated from the transaction currency amount. The following additional
changes were made in the general ledger module:

-   A separate exchange rate type can be defined on the Ledger for the reporting
    currency. If an organization doesn’t want to use a different exchange rate
    type, the field can be left blank or select the same exchange rate type that
    is used for the accounting currency. If the exchange rate type for the
    reporting currency is left blank, the system will use the exchange rate type
    for the accounting currency.

-   A new journal, Reporting currency adjustment journals, has been created to
    allow posting adjustments to ledger accounts in only the reporting currency.
    The journal only allows posting to ledger accounts, does not support
    intercompany, and the currency must be the reporting currency of the legal
    entity in which the journal is posted. When posted, the transaction currency
    and accounting currency amounts will be zero and the reporting currency
    amount will be posted with the amount entered on the transaction. This
    journal may be used for adjustments after upgrading due to changes in how
    the reporting currency is used in Accounts payable, Accounts receivable and
    Fixed assets. See the sections for these modules for examples of where this
    journal may be used.

-   The Period allocation process has been updated to allocate amounts in the
    transaction, accounting and reporting currency. Previous, we would only
    allocate the amounts in transaction and accounting currency, and then the
    accounting currency amount was translated to the reporting currency, which
    could result in the a balance remaining on the ledger account in the
    reporting currency. Now the amounts are calculated and ‘plugged’ into the
    accounting entry without any translation occurring.

-   The foreign currency revaluation process already revalued amounts in the
    reporting currency. The only change is that the reporting currency amount is
    now calculated through the transaction currency amount, as described in the
    Posting logic changes section.

-   Many reports and inquiries in general ledger already had the reporting
    currency, but a few did not. One example is the Trial balance list page,
    which now includes columns for both the accounting and reporting currency.
    Note that the reporting currency columns are hidden if the accounting
    currency and reporting currency are the same, or if there wasn’t a reporting
    currency defined on the Ledger.

### Financial reporting

An enhancement has been made to Financial reporting which allows a financial
statement to include reporting currency amounts in one of two way. On the column
definition, you can now choose to either directly report on the reporting
currency amounts posted to the Ledger (new functionality) or continue to
translate from the accounting currency to the reporting currency amounts
(existing functionality).

The change is available in the column definition under the Currency Display
setting. If **Reporting currency from Ledger** is selected, the amounts will be
reported directly from the general ledger rather than being translated. If you
want the column to print translated amounts, select the **Translate to XXX**
option, where XXX is the reporting currency you want to display in the column.
The accounting currency amounts will be translated to the selected currency
using the existing translation functionality.

### Accounts payable/Accounts receivable

The Accounts payable and Accounts receivable modules already tracked reporting
currency amounts but the amounts weren’t shown or used for various processes.
The following changes were made:

-   The reporting currency amounts are now shown on Transactions for both
    customers and vendors. This also includes the open balance of each
    transaction.

-   The aging process has been updated allowing an organization to view the
    aging buckets in either the accounting or reporting currency.

-   Various inquiries and reports were updated to show the reporting currency
    amounts, such as the Customer/Vendor to Ledger reconciliation reports.

-   The foreign currency revaluation process already revalued amounts in the
    reporting currency. The only change is that the reporting currency amount is
    now calculated through the transaction currency amount, as described in the
    Posting – all modules section.

-   UPGRADE CONSIDERATIONS - Prior to upgrade, the reporting currency amounts
    for documents (invoices, payments, etc) were calculated through the
    accounting currency. Let’s assume an invoice was posted prior to the upgrade
    and Dual currency changes. The invoice isn’t paid. During the upgrade, the
    invoice’s accounting entry is not changed. Now the organization upgrades and
    the Dual currency changes are in affect. When the payment is made, the
    payment’s reporting currency amount will now be calculated through the
    transaction currency amount. There may be a slight difference in the
    realized gain/loss amount that is calculated when the payment and invoice
    are settled due to the difference in how the reporting currency amounts were
    calculated. If the amount is considered a material difference, the new
    Reporting currency adjustment journal can be used to adjust the balance of
    the realized gain/loss and Accounts payable/receivable ledger accounts in
    only the reporting currency.

### Cash and bank management

The Cash and bank management module did not track any reporting currency amounts
for the transactions posted against each bank account. After the upgrade, the
reporting currency amounts will automatically be tracked for any new
transactions posted, but the reporting currency amounts need to be added to the
already posted transactions in the subledger.

-   UPGRADE CONSIDERATIONS – Because the bank account transactions did not track
    the reporting currency amounts in the subledger, a wizard has been added to
    add the reporting currency amounts on the bank account transactions. **The
    wizard will not post to general ledger again, but instead is taking the
    reporting currency amounts from general ledger and updating them in the
    subledger tables.**

    -   The wizard is located at Cash and bank management – Setup – Add
        reporting currency amounts to bank account transactions.

    -   The wizard will show transactions for all bank accounts in the current
        company that have a reporting currency amount of zero. This will only
        include transactions posted prior to the upgrade.

    -   The wizard will find the corresponding accounting entries in general
        ledger for each bank account transaction and default the reporting
        currency amount for each transaction. The amounts can be edited, but
        that is not recommended. You may not be able to reconcile the bank
        account balances to general ledger. The only time an amount should be
        edited is if the reporting currency amount could not be found in general
        ledger. In that scenario, the wizard would show an amount of zero for
        the reporting currency.

    -   When selecting Cancel on the wizard, the bank account transactions and
        any changes to the reporting currency amounts will be saved for the next
        time you run the wizard. The amounts are not updated on the bank account
        transactions though. When you select Finish on the wizard, the reporting
        currency amounts will be updated on the bank account transactions. If a
        mistake is made, the wizard can be run multiple times, allowing you to
        fix any incorrect reporting currency amounts.

-   No processes within Cash and bank management were changed, but various
    reports and inquiries were updated to display the reporting currency
    amounts. This includes the Cash flow forecasting reports, which were not
    updated to include the reporting currency amounts.

### Fixed assets

The Fixed assets module did not track any reporting currency amounts for the
transactions posted against each fixed asset book. After the upgrade, the
reporting currency amounts will automatically be tracked for any new
transactions posted, but the reporting currency amounts need to be added to the
already posted transactions in the subledger.

In addition, major changes have been made to the Depreciation process which
require user action after the upgrade. It’s important to read and understand the
following changes, even if you are not using the Fixed asset module yet.

-   The depreciation process has been changed in how it determines the reporting
    currency amount. The following scenario compares how depreciation previously
    determined the reporting currency amount and how it determines the reporting
    currency amount now.

**Depreciation scenario**

An asset is acquired and posted with the following amounts. Note that the
reporting currency amount is posted in general ledger but isn’t stored in
AssetTrans in the subledger.

| **Transaction type** | **Transaction amount** | **Exchange rate** | **Accounting currency amount** | **Exchange rate** | **Reporting currency amount** |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Acquisition          | 1,000,000 DKK          | 2.0               | 500,000 USD                    | 2.5               | 200,000 EUR                   |

**Previous depreciation for reporting currency**

At the end of the year, the depreciation proposal is run and calculates the
following amounts.

| **Transaction type** | **Transaction amount** | **Exchange rate** | **Accounting currency amount** | **Exchange rate** | **Reporting currency amount** |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Depreciation         | 50,000 USD             | 1.0               | 50,000 USD                     | 2.6               | 19,230.77 EUR                 |

When the depreciation proposal is run, it calculates the accounting currency
amount based on the depreciation method, but then it translates that amount to
the reporting currency using the current exchange rate between the USD and EUR.
This causes issues because the asset cannot be fully depreciated in the
reporting currency when using the spot rate.

**New depreciation for reporting currency**

The depreciation process has been changed so that the reporting currency amount
is also calculated using the depreciation method. If depreciation is run on that
asset, you will now get the following results:

| **Transaction type** | **Transaction amount** | **Exchange rate** | **Accounting currency amount** | **Exchange rate**                                                   | **Reporting currency amount** |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Depreciation         | 50,000 USD             | 1.0               | 50,000 USD                     | Displays 2.5, but isn’t used to translate to the reporting currency | 20,000 EUR                    |

When the depreciation proposal is run, it calculates the accounting currency and
reporting currency amount based on the depreciation method. The amounts are then
‘plugged’ into the accounting entry in General ledger, without any translation
occurring to determine the reporting currency amount.

-   UPGRADE CONSIDERATIONS – Because the fixed asset book transactions did NOT
    track the reporting currency, a wizard has been added allowing you to add
    the reporting currency amounts on the fixed asset book transactions. This
    wizard will NOT post to general ledger again. **The wizard must be run and
    completed for every company before an organization can enter any
    depreciation transactions because of the change to how the depreciation
    proposal calculates the reporting currency amount.**

    -   The wizard is located at Fixed assets – Setup – Add reporting currency
        amounts to fixed asset books.

    -   The wizard will show transactions for all fixed asset books in the
        current company that have a reporting currency amount of zero. This
        would only include transactions posted prior to the upgrade.

    -   The wizard does NOT pull the reporting currency amounts from the general
        ledger. As described in the previous scenario, the reporting currency
        amounts originally posted to general ledger were incorrectly using the
        spot rate. We don’t want those amounts in the fixed asset subledger,
        because the next depreciation calculation will use the incorrect
        amounts. Instead the wizard, will find the exchange rate on the date of
        the first acquisition and use that to recommend the reporting currency
        amount that should be posted in the subledger. The wizard will show
        something like the following based on our previous scenario:

| **Fixed asset** | **Book** | **Transaction type** | **Transaction date** | **Currency** | **Amount in transaction currency** | **Amount** | **Exch rate** | **Reporting currency amount** |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| BUIL-00001      | 200_SLLT | Acquisition          | 6/3/2016             | DKK          | 1,000,000                          | 500,000    | 2.5           | 250,000                       |
| BUIL-00001      | 200_SLLT | Depreciation         | 6/3/2016             | DKK          | 50,000                             | 50,000     | 2.5           | 250,000                       |
| BUIL-00001      | 200_SLLT | Depreciation         | 6/3/2016             | DKK          | 50,000                             | 50,000     | 2.5           | 250,000                       |
| BUIL-00001      | 200_SLLT | Depreciation         | 6/3/2016             | DKK          | 50,000                             | 50,000     | 2.5           | 250,000                       |

-   Many customers tracked their asset transaction details in spreadsheets,
    including the exchange rates and amounts. If you have this data in a
    spreadsheet, it can be used to create a custom exchange rate type. The
    exchange rate type can be created and updated with the exchange rates from
    the spreadsheet. This exchange rate type will then be used to default the
    exchange rate on the acquisition date and calculate the reporting currency
    amount. If an exchange rate type isn’t selected, the wizard will use the
    exchange rate type defined on the Ledger.

-   The Exchange rate and Reporting currency amounts can be changed. If the
    exchange rate is changed, the reporting currency amount will be recalculated
    using the new rate.

-   When selecting Cancel on the wizard, the fixed asset book transactions and
    any changes to the exchange rate or reporting currency amounts will be saved
    for the next time you run the wizard. The amounts are not updated on the
    fixed asset book transactions though. When you select Finish on the wizard,
    the reporting currency amounts will be updated on the fixed asset book
    transactions. If a mistake is made, the wizard can be run multiple times,
    allowing you to fix any incorrect reporting currency amounts.

-   **When the reporting currency amounts are updated completely in the
    subledger, you MUST change the setting “Have you updated all the reporting
    currency amounts on the fixed asset book transactions?” to Yes and choose
    Finish. Depreciation calculations cannot be completed until this flag is
    changed to Yes. After the flag is changed to Yes, the wizard will no longer
    be available.**

-   After updating the Fixed assets transactions in the subledger with the
    reporting currency amounts, these amounts will not match the amounts
    originally posted to general ledger. The Reporting currency adjustment
    journal can be used to update the balances of the depreciation ledger
    accounts in general ledger, so the balances will now match.

-   An entity **Asset transaction reporting currency amounts** has been added in
    the Data management workspace, allowing you to export the data from the
    wizard. You can use this data to determine the balance in the fixed asset
    subledger for the depreciation transactions, which can then be used to
    determine the amount of the reporting currency adjustment in general ledger.

-   UPGRADE CONSIDERATIONS – Multiple setup fields have been added to fixed
    assets that will be used in the depreciation calculation. These fields may
    need to be updated prior to the next depreciation calculation.

    -   On the fixed asset book (Fixed assets – Books), the General fast tab has
        a new field Acquisition price in reporting currency.

    -   On the fixed asset book (Fixed assets – Books), the Depreciation fast
        tab has a new field Expected scrap value in reporting currency.

    -   On fixed asset parameters (Fixed assets – Setup – Fixed asset
        parameters), the General fast tab has a new field Minimum depreciation
        amount in reporting currency.

    -   On books (Fixed assets – Setup – Books), the General fast tab has two
        new fields: field Round off depreciation in reporting currency and Leave
        net book value at reporting currency.

-   Because the depreciation proposal now calculates amounts in both the
    accounting and reporting currency, the Fixed asset journal has been updated
    to show the depreciation amounts in the reporting currency. The transaction
    currency is always the accounting currency for depreciation transactions, so
    those amounts will continue to show in the Debit and Credit columns. Two new
    columns, Debit in reporting currency and Credit in reporting currency, are
    added to the grid.

    -   The new fields are only available when the transaction type is one of
        the four depreciation types: Deprecation, Depreciation adjustment,
        Extraordinary depreciation, or Special depreciation allowance.

    -   If a deprecation transaction type is entered, the reporting currency
        amounts will show in the new fields and the amounts can be changed.

    -   If the accounting and reporting currency is the same on the Ledger, the
        amounts will be kept in sync. If you change the Credit amount, the
        Credit in reporting currency will automatically change to match.

    -   If any other transaction type is entered in the Fixed asset journal, the
        Debit and Credit in reporting currency amounts will never show, both
        prior to posting and after posting. The accounting and reporting
        currency amounts are still available on the Voucher that posts to
        general ledger.
