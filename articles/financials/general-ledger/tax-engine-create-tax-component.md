# Tax component

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Tax components are like sub-tax types that a tax authority can levy in the same jurisdiction or a different jurisdiction. For example, in the US, sales tax is levied at various levels of jurisdiction, such as the state, county, or city level. Different tax components can have a different treatment from an accounting, tax reporting, tax settlement, or other perspective. Also in India, there are CGST, SGST, IGST which are all GST.

### Calculation origin
Calculation origin determine the tax base amount.
#### Percent of net amount
The tax base amount will be the net amount of the document line, means *Price * Quantity*.
#### Percent of gross amount
The tax base amount will be the gross amount of the document line, which means *Price * Quantity + Other tax amount it depends on*. So by choosing this option, you have to specify the tax it depends on in ***Tax on tax component***. For example, for import order in India, IGST is calculated based on the *Net Amount + BCD + SWS*, so you should choose both BCD and SWS.
#### Percent of sales tax 
It's tax on tax scenario, which means the tax base amount is the tax amount of another tax. For example, in India, the tax base of SWS is BCD. By choosing this option, you have to specify the tax it depends on in ***Tax on tax component***.
#### Amount per unit
The tax base amount will be the quantity. 
### Tax on tax component
It's editable when the ***Calculation origin*** is *Percent of gross amount* or *Percent of sales tax*.
### Tax included in price
For transaction with price include tax, this checkbox control whether the tax is included in the price. 
### Reverse charge 
By choosing this option, the component will support reverse charge behavior, which means user will be able to specify the condition when reverse charge will be applicable, and tax will be calculate and posted accordingly.
### Non deductible
By choosing this option, the component will support non-deductible behavior, which means user will be able to specify the condition when non-deductible will be applicable, and tax will be calculate and posted accordingly.
