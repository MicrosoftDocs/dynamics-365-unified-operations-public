[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

The settle and post sales tax job settles sales tax balances on the sales tax accounts and offsets them to the sales tax settlement account for a given period.

2. In the Settlement period field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.
3. In the list, click the link in the selected row.
4. In the From date field, enter a date.
    * If the Include corrections option is not selected on the General ledger parameters page, the settlement can be processed for different versions.
