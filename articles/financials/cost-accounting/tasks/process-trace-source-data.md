# Process and trace source data

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

All data processing is run by jobs. For each job and data provider, a journal is created to document that the process has been run, and that the entries were processed in the current job. Use this procedure to set up a data source and then  trace the origin of a specific cost entry. This recording uses the USP2 demo data company USP2. Before you complete this task, make sure that you play the following task guides: "Create a cost accounting ledger," "Define cost control units," and "Manage data source for the cost accounting ledger."
