    * If you set this option to Yes, users who are assigned one of these roles can see the report in the Cost control workspace: cost accounting manager, cost accountant, cost accountant clerk, or cost object controller.

27. In the Cost object dimension hierarchy node field, enter or select a value.
    * After you've selected a Cost object dimension hierarchy, expand the Cost element dimension hierarchy to see the desired cost values. For example, you can expand the hierarchy to Manufacturing overhead to see the value.
