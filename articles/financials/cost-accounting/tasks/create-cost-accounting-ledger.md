A cost accounting ledger represents the overall reporting unit. It is defined by a cost element dimension, statistical dimension, fiscal calendar, and currency. It is agnostic to the concept of legal entities. A legal entity and its data can be associated with many cost accounting ledgers. This recording uses the USP2 demo data company.

2. Click New.
3. In the Name field, type a value.

5. In the Fiscal calendar field, enter or select a value.
6. In the Accounting currency field, enter or select a value.
