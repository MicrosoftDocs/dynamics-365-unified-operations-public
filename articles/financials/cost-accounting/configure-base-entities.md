[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


Cost accounting is an independent module that requires the following base entities are configured correctly in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.

-  Currency
-  Exchange rate
-  Fiscal calendar  

Before you use the Cost accounting module, you need to have a currency, exchange rate, and fiscal calendar defined for your company. 

To learn more about these entities, take the eLearning training course [Module 2 Currency and exchange rate setup](https://mbspartner.microsoft.com/AX/CourseModules/1215) (requires CustomerSource account).
