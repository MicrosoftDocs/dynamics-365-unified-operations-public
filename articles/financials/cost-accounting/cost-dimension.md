# Create dimensions and import dimension members

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Cost accounting is an independent module that requires data from other modules. This data is categorized into the following:

-  Cost elements
-  Cost objects
-  Statistical dimensions

A **Cost element** corresponds to a cost-relevant item in the chart of accounts. A **Cost object** corresponds to any type of financial dimension, such as products, cost centers, and projects that you want to estimate, allocate costs to, or measure directly. A **Statistical dimension** and its members are used to register non-monetary entries. Statistical dimension members can be used as an allocation base in cost distribution and allocation 

The following diagram illustrates the dimensions that are used in Cost accounting.

After the data is imported into Cost accounting, you can use it to build various perspectives that provide insights to managers at all levels of the organization. The following topics provide information about creating dimensions and importing dimension members.
