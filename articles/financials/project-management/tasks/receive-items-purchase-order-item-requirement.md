# Receive items on purchase order from item requirement

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure shows how to receive items on a purchase order from an item requirement.

By using an item requirement instead of an item transaction, you can plan for delivery just before the item is actually used, create a purchase order, include the item in the trade-agreement framework, and include the item requirement in production planning. 

This task uses the USSI data set.
