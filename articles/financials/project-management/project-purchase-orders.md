# Purchase orders for a project

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article describes the various methods that you can use to create purchase orders for a project. The method that you use depends on the purpose of the purchase order, and when the purchased items are consumed and charged to a project.

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, you can use multiple methods to create purchase orders for a project. The method that you use depends on the purpose of the purchase order, when the purchased items are consumed, and when the purchased items are charged to a project.

### Methods for creating a purchase order

You can use one of the following methods to create a purchase order in Project management and accounting. The purpose of the purchase order determines when the purchase order is consumed and, therefore, when items are charged to a project.

<td>Create a purchase order directly from a project.</td>
<td>Use this method to purchase items from an external vendor for consumption on a project. You can create the purchase order in two ways:
<ul>
<li>From the project itself. In this case, the project is already defined for the purchase order.</li>
<li>By navigating to the project purchase order. You must select both the vendor and the project to create the purchase order for.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>Items are consumed when the vendor invoice is updated.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Create a purchase order from a sales order.</td>
<td>Use this method to purchase items when you create a sales order from a project.</td>
<td>Items are consumed when the sales order is invoiced to the customer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Create a purchase order from an item requirement.</td>
<td>Use this method to purchase items when you create an item requirement from a project.</td>
<td>Items are consumed when the item requirement packing slip is updated.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE] 
> When you update the vendor invoice or packing slip, you're prompted to update the packing slip on the item requirement.
