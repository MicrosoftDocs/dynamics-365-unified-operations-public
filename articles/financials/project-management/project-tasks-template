# Synchronize project tasks from Project Service Automation directly to project activities in Finance and Operations

This topic describes the template and underlying task that is used to synchronize project tasks directly from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.

[!NOTE] Backporting of the functionality required to integrate project tasks to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3.0 is in process. This topic will be updated when the hotfix is available.

## Data flow for Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations

The Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations integration solution uses the Data integration feature to synchronize data across instances of PRoject Service Automation and Finance and Operations. The integration template that is available with the Data integration feature enables the flow of data about project tasks from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.

The following illustration shows how the data is synchronized between Project Service Automation and Finance and Operations.

## Template and task

To access the available templates, in the Microsoft PowerApps Admin Center, select **Projects**, and then, in the upper-right corner, select **New project** to select public templates.

The following template and underlying task is used to synchronize project tasks from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations:

-**Name of hte template in Data integration:** Project tasks (PSA to Fin and Ops)
-**Name of the task in the project:** Project tasks

Before synchronization of project tasks can occur, you mus synchronize project contracts and projects.

## Entity set

|Project Service Automation               | Finance and Operations                |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Project Tasks                           | Integration entity for project task   |

## Entity flow

Project tasks are managed in Project Service Automation, and they are synchronized to Finance and Operations as project activities.

## Preconditions and mapping setup

- Before synchronization of project tasks can occur, you must synchronize project contracts and projects.

## Power Query

You must use Microsoft Power Query to filter data if these conditions are met:

- You have resource specific records within a project task.

If you must use Power Query, follow these guidelines:

- The Project tasks (PSA to Fin and Ops) template has a default filter to exclude resource specific records from within a project task by setting the filter on the **IsLineTask** to **False**. If you create your own template, you must add this filter.

## Template mapping in Data integration

The following illustration shows an example of the template task mappings in Data integration.

[!NOTE] The mapping shows the field information that will be synchronized from Project Service Automation to Finance and Operations.
