# Set up the advanced bank reconciliation import process

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


The Advanced bank reconciliation feature lets you import electronic bank statements and automatically reconcile them with bank transactions in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. This article explains how to set up the import functionality for your bank statements. 

The setup for bank statement import varies, depending on the format of your electronic bank statement. Finance and Operations supports three bank statement formats out of the box: ISO20022, MT940, and BAI2.

## Sample files
For all three formats, you must have files that translate the electronic bank statement from the original format to a format that Finance and Operations can use. You can find the required resource files under the **Resources** node in Application Explorer in Microsoft Visual Studio. After you find the files, copy them to a single known location, so that you can more easily upload them during the setup process.

| Resource name                                           | File name                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| BankStmtImport\_BAI2CSV\_to\_BAI2XML\_xslt              | BAI2CSV-to-BAI2XML.xslt              |
| BankStmtImport\_BAI2XML\_to\_Reconciliation\_xslt       | BAI2XML-to-Reconciliation.xslt       |
| BankStmtImport\_BankReconciliation\_to\_Composite\_xslt | BankReconciliation-to-Composite.xslt |
| BankStmtImport\_ISO20022XML\_to\_Reconciliation\_xslt   | ISO20022XML-to-Reconciliation.xslt   |
| BankStmtImport\_MT940TXT\_to\_MT940XML\_xslt            | MT940TXT-to-MT940XML.xslt            |
| BankStmtImport\_MT940XML\_to\_Reconciliation\_xslt      | MT940XML-to-Reconciliation.xslt      |
| BankStmtImport\_SampleBankCompositeEntity\_xml          | SampleBankCompositeEntity.xml        |

## Examples of bank statement formats and technical layouts

## Set up the import of ISO20022 bank statements
First, you must define the bank statement format processing group for ISO20022 bank statements by using the data entity framework.

1.  Go to **Workspaces** &gt; **Data management**.
2.  Click **Import**.
3.  Enter a name for the format, such as **ISO20022**.
4.  Set the **Source data format** field to **XML-Element**.
5.  Set the **Entity name** field to **Bank statements**.
6.  To upload the import files, click **Upload**, and then browse to select the **SampleBankCompositeEntity.xml** file that you saved earlier.
7.  After the Bank statements entity is uploaded and the mapping is completed, click the **View map** action for the entity.
8.  The Bank statements entity is a composite entity that consists of four separate entities. In the list, select **BankStatementDocumentEntity**, and then click the **View map** action.
9.  On the **Transformations** tab, click **New**.
10. For sequence number 1, click **Upload file**, and select the **ISO20022XML-to-Reconciliation.xslt** file that you saved earlier. **Note:** Finance and Operations transformation files are built for the standard format. Because banks often diverge from this format, you may have to update the transformation file to map to your bank statement format. <!-- For details about the expected format for ISO20022, see [Dynamics AX ISO20022 Layout](./media/dynamicsaxiso20022layout1.xlsx).-->
11. Click **New**.
12. For sequence number 2, click **Upload file**, and select the **BankReconciliation-to-Composite.xslt** file that you saved earlier.
13. Click **Apply transforms**.

After the format processing group is set up, the next step is to define the bank statement format rules for ISO20022 bank statements.

1.  Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Advanced bank reconciliation setup** &gt; **Bank statement format**.
2.  Click **New**.
3.  Specify a statement format, such as **ISO20022**.
4.  Enter a name for the format.
5.  Set the **Processing group** field to the group that you defined earlier, such as **ISO20022**.
6.  Select the **XML file** check box.

The last step is to enable Advanced bank reconciliation and set the statement format on the bank account.

1.  Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Bank accounts**.
2.  Select the bank account, and open it to view the details.
3.  On the **Reconciliation** tab, set the **Advanced bank reconciliation** option to **Yes**.
4.  Set the **Statement format** field to the format that you created earlier, such as **ISO20022**.

## Set up the import of MT940 bank statements

4.  Set the **Source data format** field to **XML-Element**.
5.  Set the **Entity name** field to **Bank statements**.
6.  To upload import files, click **Upload**, and then browse to select the **SampleBankCompositeEntity.xml** file that you saved earlier.
7.  After the Bank statements entity is uploaded and the mapping is completed, click the **View map** action for the entity.
8.  The Bank statements entity is a composite entity that consists of four separate entities. In the list, select **BankStatementDocumentEntity**, and then click the **View map** action.
9.  On the **Transformations** tab, click **New**.
10. For sequence number 1, click **Upload file**, and select the **MT940TXT-to-MT940XML.xslt** file that you saved earlier.
11. Click **New**.
12. For sequence number 2, click **Upload file**, and select the **MT940XML-to-Reconciliation.xslt** file that you saved earlier. **Note:** Finance and Operations transformation files are built for the standard format. Because banks often diverge from this format, you may have to update the transformation file to map to your bank statement format. <!--- For details about the expected format for MT940, see [Dynamics AX MT940 Layout](./media/dynamicsaxmt940layout1.xlsx)-->
13. Click **New**.
14. For sequence number 3, click **Upload file**, and select the **BankReconciliation-to-Composite.xslt** file that you saved earlier.
15. Click **Apply transforms**.

After the format processing group is set up, the next step is to define the bank statement format rules for MT940 bank statements.

1.  Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Advanced bank reconciliation setup** &gt; **Bank statement format**.
