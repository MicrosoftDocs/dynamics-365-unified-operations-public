# Set up a fund in the public sector

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Fund types must be created before you set up funds. Each fund must have a name and a unique number, and must be assigned a fund type and fund class. This procedure was created using the PSUS demo company data in the public sector partition.

1. Go to General ledger > Chart of accounts > Funds > Funds.
2. Click New.
3. In the Fund number field, type a value.
4. In the Fund name field, type a value.
5. In the Fund type field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.
6. In the list, select the fund type for this fund.
7. In the Fund class field, select an option.
8. Set the Non-reporting fund option to Yes or No.
9. Set the Major fund option to Yes or No.
10. Set the Override selected year-end option to Yes or No.
11. If you set the Override selected year-end option to Yes, select a year-end option.
12. Click Save.
