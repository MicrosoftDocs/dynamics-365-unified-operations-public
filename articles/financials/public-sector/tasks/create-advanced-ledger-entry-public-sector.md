# Create an advanced ledger entry in the public sector

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Public-sector organizations can use advanced ledger entries to create, adjust, and reverse ledger entries. For example, advanced ledger entries can be used to reclassify expenditures if invoices are mistakenly posted to the wrong account or project. This procedure was created using the PSUS demo company data in the public sector partition.
