# Plan for one-time vendors in the public sector

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article explains how to prepare to import and create multiple one-time vendors and invoices. 

Typically, if you plan to mass-import vendor and invoice information, you first create a data file in spreadsheet format and save it in CSV (comma-separated values) format.

-   Because commas are used to separate the fields in a CSV file, don't use commas in the text of an entry. For example, to specify a company name of “Smith, Smith, and Jones,” enter it as **Smith Smith and Jones**.
-   If you don't set values for fields on this page, the newly created vendor accounts use values from the one-time vendor profile that is referenced on the **Accounts payable parameters** page. For example, if the method of payment is set to **Check** for the one-time vendor profile on the **Accounts payable parameters** page, that method of payment will also be set for the one-time vendors that you're adding.
-   The **One-time supplier** Accounts payable number sequence is used to assign the one-time vendor accounts and must not be set to **Continuous** for this service. Invoices are generated in a draft state. Before you create payment proposals for payment, you must post the invoices.

The following table show the fields that the import file must contain. Each field label is equivalent to a column heading in a spreadsheet, and each spreadsheet row contains the data for each applicable column.
