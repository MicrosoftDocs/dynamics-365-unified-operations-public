## Manual settlement of an advance payment that has tax and an invoice that has tax

Tax is posted on both the advance payment and the sales invoice. On settling these transactions through the Open transaction editing form, the double tax entry gets reversed.
The following table shows the tax entries that are generated in various scenarios when an invoice that has tax and a payment that has tax are settled

| Transaction details | Example                                                 | Tax entries that are generated during settlement             |
