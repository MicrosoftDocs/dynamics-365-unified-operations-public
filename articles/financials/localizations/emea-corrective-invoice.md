# Corrective invoicing

A credit note or credit memorandum (memo) is a document that reduces or
eliminates the amount that the buyer has to pay.

A credit note lists the products, quantities, and agreed prices for products or
services that the seller provided the buyer, but the buyer returned or did not
receive. It may be issued in the case of damaged goods, errors, or allowances.
For some countries/regions, the credit note functionality allows you to add both
a correction line and a new correct line. The credit note for sales invoices and
free text invoices uses the same layout as the invoice with the following
differences:

-   Instead of displaying "Invoice", the credit note shows "Credit note" as the
    document name.

-   The credit note includes the fields **Main invoice no.** and **Reason for
    correction**.
