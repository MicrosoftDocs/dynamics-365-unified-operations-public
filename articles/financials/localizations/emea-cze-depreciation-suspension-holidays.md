# Depreciation suspension (holidays)

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the suspension, or postponement, of depreciation for the Czech Republic.

Depreciation suspension postpones the depreciation that should be calculated for the suspended period. Instead, the depreciation occurs in the period after the suspended period. You can use depreciation suspension only for books that have a posting layer of Tax or None, and that use following depreciation methods:

-   Straight line service life
-   Regular CZ
-   Accelerated CZ

To suspend fixed asset depreciation, on the **Fixed assets** page, select the fixed asset, and then click **Books** &gt; **Suspension**. On the **Depreciation suspension** page, click **Create new suspension**, and then select the year of suspension. On the **Suspension** page, a new record is created that contains suspension information. To cancel the suspension operation, select the record on the **Suspension** page, and then click **Cancel depreciation suspension**.
