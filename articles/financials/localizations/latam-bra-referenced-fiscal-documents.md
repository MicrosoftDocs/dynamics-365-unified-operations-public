# Referenced fiscal documents for Brazil

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides an overview of referenced fiscal documents that are used in Brazil.

In some scenarios, a fiscal document must include another fiscal document's information. You can attach the information for a referenced fiscal document in two ways:

-   **Manual** – Register related information when the fiscal document isn't available. All information is required, and validation makes sure that the information fulfills the fiscal requirements.
-   **Automatic** – Select an available fiscal document.

### Examples

-   If you try to reference a fiscal document that isn't in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, all the fiscal document information must be entered.
-   When you return an item to a vendor or receive a return from a customer, a reference to the original document is added.
-   Enter a manual fiscal document, model 01, in the system. You will create a fiscal document that references the original fiscal document.
-   Enter a Sales Order for Retail Sales or NF-e (model 55). The fiscal document will reference the original retail document and fiscal printer.
-   Create a sales order, and post the invoice. Then create a return order that references the previous order. The return fiscal document will create a fiscal document that references the original fiscal document.

## Manual
When a fiscal document isn't available, you can attach customer or vendor fiscal documents as fiscal references to a fiscal document. You can also view the fiscal references that are attached to a posted fiscal document.

### Fiscal reference placeholders

Fiscal document text placeholders are predefined tags that represent specific values. When you create a fiscal document source text on the **Fiscal document source texts** page, you can include placeholders in the **Text ID** field. You can also include placeholders in the **Note** field when you attach a fiscal document text to a sales order, purchase order, or free text invoice. When you post a sales order, purchase order, or free text invoice that has a fiscal document text that includes placeholders, the placeholders are replaced by the values in the predefined tags.
