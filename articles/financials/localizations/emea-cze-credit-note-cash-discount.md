## Credit notes for cash discounts

Credit notes for cash discounts are posted automatically when open customer
transactions (customer invoice and customer payment) are settled. When credit
notes for cash discounts are posted, they include the reason codes that you set
up in Account receivable parameters, and a reference to the original invoice.
Credit notes for cash discounts are numbered by using the number sequence that
you set up for credit notes. The document printout is named **Tax corrective
document**. It includes the original invoice number, the VAT base and amount,
and the reason why a correction was printed.
