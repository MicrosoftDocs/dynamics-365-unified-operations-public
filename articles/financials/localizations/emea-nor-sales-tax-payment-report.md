# VAT statement for Norway
This topic includes country-specific information about how to set up the value-added tax (VAT) statement for legal entities that have a primary address in Norway. For more information about general VAT reporting, see [VAT reporting](emea-vat-reporting.md).

## Set up sales tax authorities
To generate a VAT declaration in the required format for a specific tax authority, you must set up the report layout for the sales tax authorities.

1. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, in the **Report layout** field, select **Norwegian report format**.
2. Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that you will use for the sales tax codes.

## Set up sales tax reporting codes
The following example shows how you can set up sales tax reporting codes to generate the VAT statement.

For users in legal entities in Norway, the following sales tax reporting codes can be created and assigned to sales tax codes.

| Reporting code | Description                                                                        | Select the reporting code in this field on the Report setup tab or Report setup - credit note tab on the Sales tax codes page |

## Set up the sales tax period code
On the **Sales tax settlement periods** page, create a list of periods. In the **Sales tax period code** field, set the period codes according to the submission periods. These period codes should be aligned with the values that the tax authorities provided. The values in this field will be used when an XML file is generated.

Here is an example for bi-monthly reporting.

|             Period               | Sales tax period code |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| First period – January/February  | 014                   |
| Second period – March/April      | 024                   |
| Third period – May/June          | 034                   |
| Fourth period – July/August      | 044                   |
| Fifth period – September/October | 054                   |
| Sixth period – November/December | 064                   |

## Configure the ER model and format for the report
To review or change the reporting formats, you must use Electronic reporting (ER) functionality. You can find the VAT statement format for legal entities that have a primary address in Norway on the **Configurations** page (**Organization administration** > **Electronic reporting** > **Configurations**). In the tree of ER models, expand the **Vat declaration model** node, and then select **VAT declaration (NO)**.

You can use the designer to review or change the configuration that you selected in the model tree. For more information, see [Electronic reporting](../../dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The same VAT declaration model is used for Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Norway. This model aggregates tax data that is required for VAT declaration.

## Generate the VAT statement
1. On the **Report sales tax for settlement period** page, enter values in the **Settlement period**, **From date**, and **Sales tax payment version** fields.
2. Click **OK**.
3. In the **Format mapping** field, select one of the following options:

    - **VAT declaration (NO)** – Generate an XML file.
    - **Sales tax report (NO)** – Print the report in Microsoft Excel.

4. Before the XML file can be created, you must enter values in the following fields:

    - **Message type** – Select **Main**, **Additional**, or **Correction**.
    - **KID number**
    - **Industry type**
    - **Explanation**
  
### Create a report after a sales tax payment update
1. On the **Sales tax payments** page, select the applicable vouchers, and then click **Export VAT file**.
2. In the **Format mapping** field, select one of the following options to specify the type of output file:

    - **VAT declaration (NO)** – Generate an XML file.
    - **Sales tax report (NO)** – Print the report in Microsoft Excel.

> [!NOTE]
> You can combine several sales tax payments and print one combined report/XML file that includes summarized data for all selected records. You can combine only records that are related to one settlement period, and that have the same **From date** and **To date** values. For example, you can combine an **Original version** record and its **Corrections/Latest corrections** record.
