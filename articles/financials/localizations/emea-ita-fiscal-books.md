# Italian sales tax books

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


The topic describes how to set up and use Italian sales tax books and Italian sales tax book sections.

According to Italian fiscal legislation, every value-added tax (VAT) transaction must belong to a tax book (*Libro IVA*) that will be used for tax reporting. To fulfill these legislative requirements, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition implements Italian sales tax books. Sales tax books can be of different types. You must specify the sales tax book type to help guarantee that all sales and purchase transactions are included on the **Italian sales tax payment** report. You can keep as many sales tax books of the **Sales** and **Purchase** types as you require. Every tax book can be divided into multiple tax book sections (*Sezionale IVA*). All sales tax transactions must be sequentially numbered (without gaps) and ordered by posting date. A tax book section is equivalent to a number sequence for the Italian sales tax voucher number (*Protocollo IVA*) that must always be applied during posting to help guarantee chronological order by posting date.

## Prerequisites
The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Category</th>
<th>Prerequisite</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Legal entity</td>
<td>The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy. (Click <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Organizations</strong> &gt; <strong>Legal entities</strong> &gt; <strong>Addresses</strong> &gt; <strong>Country/region</strong>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Number sequences</td>
<td>Set up as many number sequences as you require to cover all the required types of sales tax transactions. (Click <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Number sequences</strong> &gt; <strong>Number sequences</strong>.) All these number sequences must be continuous and must have <strong>Company</strong> scope.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Journal names</td>
<td>Set up the required journal names. (Click <strong>General Ledger</strong> &gt; <strong>Journal setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Journal names</strong> or <strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Journals</strong> &gt; <strong>Journal names</strong>.) On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>Sales tax</strong> section, in the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field, specify one of the following values:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not included</strong> – Select this value for invoices and credit notes that come from countries/regions that are outside the European community.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> – Select this value for purchase invoices and credit notes.</li>
<li><strong>Sales</strong> – Select this value for sales invoices and credit notes.</li>
<li><strong>Empty</strong> – Select this value for all other types of transactions.</li>
</ul>
In some cases, the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field is set automatically, based on the <strong>Journal type</strong> value. For example, if the <strong>Journal type</strong> field is set to <strong>Invoice register</strong>, the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field is set to <strong>Purchase</strong> by default.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Module parameters</td>
<td>For vouchers to follow the number sequences of the related invoices and credit notes, you must select the <strong>Reuse numbers</strong> check box when you define the number sequences for those invoices and credit notes. You can find this check box on the <strong>Number sequences</strong> tab of the following pages:
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable parameters</li>
<li>Accounts payable parameters</li>
<li>Project management and accounting parameters</li>
</ul>
For example, on the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> page, on the <strong>Number sequences</strong> tab, select the <strong>Reuse numbers</strong> check box for <strong>Free text invoice voucher</strong> to synchronize number allocation for free text invoice vouchers and free text invoices.</td>

| Create | Automatically create all the required sales tax book sections for existing sales tax books of the **Sales** and **Purchase** types. Sales tax book sections are created for every number sequence that is defined for purchase invoice vouchers or purchase credit note vouchers or sales invoice vouchers or sales credit note vouchers or free text invoice vouchers or free text credit note vouchers on the **Accounts payable parameters**, **Accounts receivable parameters**, or **Project management and accounting parameters** page, and for every number sequence that is used on the **Journal names** page for vouchers that have the **Italian sales tax book** field set to **Purchase** or **Sales**. Every sales tax book section that is created is automatically attached to the default sales tax book. (The sales tax book must be created before the sales tax book sections.) If several sales tax books of the same sales tax book type (**Sales** or **Purchase**) exist, the first sales tax book is used by default. However, you can manually change this attachment. If no sales tax book exists, no sales tax book sections are automatically created. |

## Sales tax book status
When a new sales tax period is created, sales tax book lines are automatically set up for every sales tax book that exists. If an additional sales tax book is created, lines can be manually created for existing periods that haven't been closed. Click **Tax** &gt; **Indirect taxes** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales tax settlement periods**, and then click **Sales tax book status**. The following table describes the tabs on the **Sales tax book status** page.

| Tab      | Description                                                                                               |

| First page number | The current first page number for the selected sales tax book.        |
| Changed to        | Enter the new first page number to use on the final sales tax report. |

## Using sales tax books
When the setup is completed, the sales tax book sections appear on the **Number sequences** tab of the following pages:

-   Accounts receivable parameters
-   Accounts payable parameters
-   Project management and accounting parameters

Voucher numbers that are assigned during posting must be sequentially ordered by posting date, and the sales tax transactions that use the same number sequence code must be posted in order. If the voucher numbers aren't sequentially ordered, the user receives an error message. In addition, posting is interrupted if a sales tax transaction isn't assigned to any sales tax book section when the user updates an invoice. Whenever a voucher is posted through a sales tax book section, the identifiers of the related sales tax book and sales tax book section are saved in the tax transactions. (Click **Tax** &gt; **Sales tax inquiries** &gt; **Posted sales tax**, and then click the **Posting** tab.) This data can then be used during further sales tax reporting. Italian sales tax books are used for filtering, grouping, and sorting on the report that is accessed at **Tax** &gt; **Declarations** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales Tax (Italy)**.
