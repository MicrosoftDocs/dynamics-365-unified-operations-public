# VAT register transactions for Eastern Europe

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about VAT register transactions for Estonia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, and Poland. 

For legal entities with a primary address in Estonia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, and Poland, you can review tax transactions and update the **Date of VAT register** for them. To view the VAT register transactions, open **Tax** &gt; **Periodic tasks** &gt; **VAT register transactions**. This page displays tax transactions that have been created by sales tax codes of type **Standard VAT** for which the **Date of VAT register** is empty. You can fill in the **Date of VAT register** field for tax transactions using the **Date of VAT register** button on the **Main menu**. For legal entities with a primary address in the Czech Republic, there is an additional column, **Postponed VAT**. If this field is selected this indicates that value-added tax has not been reported for the transaction. Typically this applies to sales credit notes that are awaiting confirmation from the customer. You can select this check box during the sales invoice posting process. On the **Sales tax codes** page (**Tax** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales tax codes**), you can review or update a sales tax code type. For more information about sales tax codes, refer to [Set up sales tax codes](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-codes.md).
