# Exchange rate adjustments

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the exchange rate adjustment functionality for users in legal entities in Estonia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.

The functionality for exchange rate adjustments for Estonia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia includes the following extensions that are relevant for Accounts receivable and Accounts payable:

-   Postings of exchange rate adjustments can be reversed as corrections (negative amounts) to the original adjustments.
-   When consecutive unrealized adjustments are posted, the same general ledger posting account and transaction type are used, regardless of whether the adjustments represent a gain or a loss.
-   Calculated exchange rate gains are always posted to gain accounts, and calculated exchange rate losses are always posted to loss accounts.

Legal entities that have their primary address in the Czech Republic can use a special method for exchange rate adjustment. This method is known as the Incremental method. When this method is turned on, changes that the current feature introduces aren't applied. Unrealized and realized gains or losses are calculated against the last exchange rate that was used. The adjusted amount is used instead of the original amount as the basis of calculation. To switch to the Incremental exchange rate adjustment method, on the **General ledger parameters** page, in the **Foreign currency revaluation** section, in the **Calculation method** field, select **Incremental**. The following example shows how the exchange rate adjustment functionality works for Estonia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia. Here is the business scenario for this example:

-   An invoice in a foreign currency is posted on December 1, 2012.
-   The payment in the foreign currency is posted on January 3, 2013
-   Settlement is done to apply the payment to the invoice.
-   Exchange rates adjustment is done on December 31, 2012 (method = Standard).
-   Exchange rates adjustment is done on January 1, 2013 (method = Invoice date).

Here are the exchange rates for Canadian dollars (CAD) to U.S. dollars (USD) for this example:

-   December 1, 2012: 400.0000
-   December 31, 2012: 450.0000
-   January 3, 2013: 420.0000

### Revaluation  (Standard method; date = December 31, 2012)
For this revaluation example, notice that the entry from January 3, 2013, is a direct reversal of the December 31, 2012 entry. Even the GL accounts and posting types are the same. Additionally, notice that the **Correction** flag has been set.

| Date                             | Debit/credit | Amounts               | General ledger (GL) account    | Transaction type             | Posting type       | Credit | Correction |

| 31-Dec-12           | Credit       | 0 CAD/5,000 USD       | Unrealized currency adj profit | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain | X      |            |
| 3-Jan-13            | Debit        | 0 CAD/5,000 USD       | AR                             | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain |        | X          |
 3-Jan-13            | Credit       | 0 CAD/5,000 USD       | Unrealized currency adj profit | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain | X      | X          |
 

### Revaluation (Invoice date method; date = January 1, 2013)
For this revaluation, notice that the entry from January 1, 2013, is a direct reversal of the January 3, 2013 entry). Even the GL accounts and posting types are the same. Additionally, notice that the **Correction** flag has been set.

| Date   | Debit/credit | Amounts | General ledger (GL) account| Transaction type| Posting type| Credit | Correction |
|--------|--------------|---------|----------------------------|----------------|--------|------------|--------------|
|1-Jan-13 | Debit  | 0 CAD/5,000 USD | AR                             | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain |   | X |
|1-Jan-13 | Credit | 0 CAD/5,000 USD | Unrealized currency adj profit | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain | X | X |
|3-Jan-13 | Debit  | 0 CAD/5,000 USD | AR                             | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain |   |   |
|3-Jan-13 | Credit | 0 CAD/5,000 USD | Unrealized currency adj profit | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain | X |   |

The system behavior is the same, regardless of whether the **Correction** option in the **Transaction reversal** section on the **General ledger parameters** page is set to **Yes** or **No**.
