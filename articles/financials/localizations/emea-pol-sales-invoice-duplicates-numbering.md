For legal entities in Poland, the Duplicate sales invoice numbering functionality lets users identify and track duplicate sales invoices. This topic provides information about the Duplicate sales invoice numbering functionality, and explains how to duplicate an invoice, delete a duplicate invoice, and print a copy of a duplicate invoice.

For legal entities in Poland, the Duplicate sales invoice numbering functionality lets users identify a duplicate sales invoice, and track the duplicate invoice number andÂ date, and the user who created the duplicate invoice.

To duplicate an invoice, on the **Invoice journal** page, select the invoice to duplicate, and then click **Duplicate**. On the **Duplicate** page, click **New** to duplicate the selected invoice. After the invoice is duplicated, complete the following fields.
