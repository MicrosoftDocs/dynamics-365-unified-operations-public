# Petty cash for Eastern Europe

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the petty cash functionality that lets users in Estonia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, and Russia reflect cash operations in the system.

You can use the petty cash functionality to automate operations for receipts and expenditures of cash, the creation of primary documents, and the printing of related reports. The petty cash functionality lets you perform the following operations:

-   Account the receipt and expenditure of available cash assets.
-   Generate typical cash forms: Cash reimbursement slips, Cash disbursement slips, and a Journal of registration for cash slips.
-   Control the maximum cash amount that is allowed for operations with customers, vendors, and so on.
-   Reflect cash operations in various currencies in the system.
-   Convert the amounts of cash operations in foreign currency to the default currency to provide accounting reporting.
-   Generate a **Cash book** report and a cashier’s report.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use the petty cash functionality, you must complete the following prerequisites:

-   Set up cash accounts.
-   Set up cash posting profiles.
-   Set up number sequences for cash document numbering.
-   Set up default values for Cash and bank management parameters.
-   Set up cash journal names in General ledger.

### Set up cash accounts

To set up a Cash, open **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Bank accounts** &gt; **Cash accounts**, and enter the following information.

## Daily cash operations via a General journal

On the **Invoice** tab, you can specify posting profiles for the selected account and offset account. If the registered transaction is a prepayment, select the **Prepayment** check box on the **Payment** tab. In the **Representative** field group, fill in the fields as you did for the Slip journal lines to print on the **Cash** report. To check journal entries, on the Action Pane, click **Validate**.

## Cash transaction approval and posting
For cash transactions, the following statuses can be applied: **None**, **Confirmed**, **Approved**, and **Rejected**. A **Use confirm status** parameter on the **Approval** FastTab of the **Cash** tab at **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Cash and bank management parameters** lets you activate two additional statuses: **Confirmed** and **Rejected**. Confirmation is appropriate when cash documents are issued, and cash receipts or expenditures are shared between two employees: accountant and cashier. The **Reset status** function changes the current transaction status. **Approved** becomes **Confirmed**, and **Confirmed** becomes **None**. Cash journal entries can be edited only when the status is **None**. Cash transactions can be rejected only if the transaction status is **Confirmed**. Rejected cash documents are included on the **Journal of registration of cash documents** report, but they aren't reflected on the **Cash book** report. To confirm a transaction, select the corresponding Slip journal line, and then click **Documents approval** &gt; **Confirm**. An order number is generated, based on the specified number sequence. The transaction status is changed to **Confirmed**, and you can no longer edit the journal line. The cash account balance remains unchanged. To reject a cash document, click **Documents approval** &gt; **Reject**. This option is available only for documents that have **Confirmed** status. To approve a transaction, select the corresponding Slip journal line, and then click **Documents approval** &gt; **Approve**. The **Approved** status indicates that cash funds are received or expended. The cash balance is changed. The cash transaction can be posted. To cancel an **Approved** status and reset the status to **None**, click **Documents approval** &gt; **Reset status**. Only approved cash transactions can be posted. To post a journal, click **Post** &gt; **Post**.

## Print a cash order
To print a cash order, select a Slip journal line, and then, on the Action Pane, click **Print** &gt; **Cash order report**. The system generates a printing form for either a Cash reimbursement slip or a Cash disbursement slip, depending on whether an amount is entered in the **Debit** field the or **Credit** field for the selected line:

-   If there is an amount in the **Debit** field: Cash reimbursement slip
-   If there is an amount in the **Credit** field: Cash disbursement slip

Slip journal lines that have **Confirmed**, **Approved**, or **Rejected** status can be printed. You can also print cash order documents at **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquires and reports** &gt; **Cash order**.

## Periodic tasks
The following tasks can be performed at **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Periodic tasks**.

<td>Use this task to make sure that the ledger balances for cash accounts fit the cash balance.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cash report creation (for Poland only)</td>
<td>Create a <strong>Cash</strong> report. The <strong>Cash</strong> report number is generated based on the number sequence that is set up for <strong>Report number</strong>. In the dialog box for the task, in the <strong>To date</strong>, specify the last date for which cash transactions should be counted for the <strong>Cash</strong> report. Use the <strong>Filter</strong> function on the <strong>Records to include</strong> tab to specify additional criteria to limit the selection of cash transactions. These criteria can include cash account numbers and currency codes. In the <strong>Create by</strong> field, select the user who is responsible for report creation. To view the <strong>Cash</strong> report that is created, use the <strong>Cash reports</strong> button on the <strong>Cash accounts</strong> page.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Cash - Exchange adjustment FIFO and LIFO (for Poland only)</td>
<td>Calculate the exchange adjustment per Polish standards. Use the <strong>Filter</strong> function on the <strong>Records to include</strong> tab to specify the cash account to run the task for. Select the <strong>Recalculation</strong> check box to do a full recalculation of the exchange adjustment difference for all open periods. Here is how the exchange adjustment is calculated when the first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO) methods are used:
<ul>
<li><strong>FIFO method</strong> – The system searches for an expenditure transaction that has an earlier transaction date (smaller order number) and settles it with a receipt transaction that has an earlier transaction date (smaller order number).</li>
<li><strong>LIFO method</strong> – The system searches for an expenditure transaction that has a later transaction date (larger order number) and settles it with a receipt transaction that has a later transaction date (larger order number).</li>
</ul>
The settled amount is reflected in the <strong>Settled currency</strong> field on the <strong>Cash transaction</strong> page. If there is an exchange adjustment difference, the amount is reflected in the <strong>Exchange adjustment amount</strong> field, and a transaction of the <strong>Exchange rate difference</strong> document type is generated in the <strong>Cash transaction</strong> table. Ledger accounts for profit/loss transactions are set in the <strong>Currency</strong> table (<strong>Exchange rate financial profit</strong> and <strong>Exchange rate financial loss</strong>).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Foreign currency revaluation - Cash</td>
<td>Use this task to have an adequate balance in the default currency on the reporting date when the operations are entered in foreign currencies. Use the <strong>Filter</strong> function on the <strong>Records to include</strong> tab to specify the cash account to run the task for. In the dialog box for the task, use the <strong>From currency</strong> and <strong>To Currency</strong> fields to specify transaction currencies. The system compares the amount in the currency that was converted by using exchange rate on the selected date with the amount in the default currency. The difference between the two amounts (excluding the previous exchange adjustment) is the calculated exchange adjustment. This task creates an approved cash transaction of the <strong>Exchange adjustment</strong> type. The ledger transaction is formed by using the ledger account for cash and the ledger account that is specified in <strong>Unrealized profit</strong> or <strong>Unrealized loss</strong> in the <strong>Currency</strong> table.</td>
