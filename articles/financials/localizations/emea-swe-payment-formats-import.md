This topic provides information about the BankGirot MAX, BankGirot OCR import, and BankGirot return formats for Sweden.

BankGirot MAX, BankGirot OCR
----------------------------

BankGirot MAX and BankGirot OCR file import lets you import customer payments in BankGirot file formats. BG MAX is a file layout that collects all payments in one file. OCR is a specific kind of reference in the BG MAX file format with a payment reference. To import payments, complete the following steps.

1.  Go to the **Payment journal** page.
2.  Click **Lines**.
3.  Click **Functions** &gt; **Import payments**.
4.  In the dialog box, select the method of payment, and then browse to the location of the file to import.

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Before you can complete this step, you must have already imported the configurations from Lifecycle Services (LCS) and set up the methods of payment. For more information, see [File formats for method of payments](emea-select-file-formats-for-the-method-of-payments.md).

After you import the payment file, payment journal lines should be created for the selected journal and marked for settlement with customer invoices.

## Bankgirot Autogiro returns
Bankgirot Autogiro returns format for the direct debit payment format of the same name. These messages can be imported as a response to direct debit messages that were previously exported. Currently, these payments are represented in Operations as payment journal lines with a **Sent** status. To import a file, complete the following steps.

1.  Go to the **Payment transfers** page.
2.  Click **Return file-customer**.
3.  In the dialog box, select corresponding method of payment, and then browse to the location of the file to import.

After you import the return file, the payments should be updated to the status **Approved**.
