# Conditional sales tax for protested promissory notes or bills of exchange
[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


For legal entities in Spain, if a promissory note payment for a vendor or a bill of exchange payment for a customer is settled against an invoice that includes conditional tax, and you protest the settlement, the cancellation of conditional tax is registered with a voucher that is related to the settlement cancellation voucher.

*Conditional sales tax* is sales tax that is paid proportionally to the actual amount that is paid on an invoice. For more information about conditional tax, see [Sales tax overview](../general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.md). A *promissory note* is a written agreement in which the maker of the note promises to pay a specific amount at a specific time. A *bill of exchange* is a written or electronic order from a customer that specifies that another party (usually a bank) should pay a stated amount to the company. For more information about bills of exchange, see [Set up bills of exchange](../accounts-receivable/set-up-bills-exchange.md).

For legal entities in Spain, if the promissory note was settled against an invoice that includes conditional tax, the tax transaction is reversed when a Redraw promissory note journal is posted.
