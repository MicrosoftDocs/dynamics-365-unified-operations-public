# Tax on natural resources report

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic explains how to set up and generate the Tax on natural resources (NR Tax) report.

Latvian companies must periodically submit a **Tax on natural resources** (**NR tax**) report. This functionality applies only to legal entities in Latvia. Tax must also be calculated on imported or self-produced goods that are used internally. Finally, tax on natural resources must be calculated for packaging materials that are used to package goods that are sold within the reporting period.

## Prerequisites
| Prerequisite                                                   | More information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set up a tax authority.                                        |    |
| Set up the ledger posting group for the Natural resources tax. |  |
| Set up a settlement period for the Natural resources tax.      |  |
| Set up sales tax codes for the Natural resources tax.          | |
| Set up sales tax groups for the Natural resources tax.         |  |
| Set up tax groups for the Natural resources tax.               | Use the **Natural resources tax group** page to set up tax groups that define the correct sales tax codes, based on the intersection of the tax group and sales tax group for the Natural resources tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Set up inventory parameters.                                   | On the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page, set the **Calculate packing material fees** option to **Yes**. In the **Sales tax group** field, select a sales tax group for the Natural resources tax. By default, this sales tax group is used to find the sales tax code that is used for report calculations if a transaction that is transferred to the report has no sales tax group. |
| Specify natural resources tax information for an item.         | In Product information management, on the **Released products** page, on the **Manage inventory** tab, in the **Natural resource tax group** field, specify a value to calculate the Natural resources tax for an item in a sale or in inventory transactions.                                                                                                                                              |

## Report setup
Before you can generate the **Natural resources tax** report, you must set up the lines for each report layout. Repeat the following steps for every line in each report layout.

1.  Click **Tax** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Natural resources tax report setup**.
2.  Click **New**.
3.  In the **Form number** field, select the form to set up:
    -   **Form 2** – This form shows information about the use of natural resources and any environmental pollution that is generated within the reporting period.
    -   **Form 3** – This form shows information about the tax on natural resources that is calculated for goods that were imported or produced by the company and sold in Latvia for the first time.

4.  Select a sequence number. This number specifies the position of the line in the sequence of lines on the report.
5.  In the **Line type** field, select the type of report line:
    -   **Header** – The line is printed as header lines on report pages.
    -   **Line**
    -   **Total** – The line shows the summarized line values.

6.  If you selected **Line** in step 5, enter the line code for the **Natural resources tax** report line.
7.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the transaction.
8.  In the **Total line code** field, enter the total line code. If you selected **Line** in step 5, the **Warehouse** field shows the warehouse code.
9.  In the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code that was created for the calculation of the Natural resources tax.
10. In the **Packing material code** field, select the packing material code that was created for the Natural resources tax. This field isn't available if you select a sales tax code in the **Sales tax code** field. Only one of these two fields is available at a time.

## Generate the Natural resources tax report
Natural resources taxes are calculated during inventory journal transactions, and when sales or project invoices are created for Latvian customers, if the transactions involve items that are subject to the Natural resources tax. This section describes to get a list of the Natural resources tax transactions that are related to packing materials and print the Natural resources tax statement.

1.  Click **Tax** &gt; **Declarations** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Tax on natural resources**.
2.  Click **Create** &gt; **Create natural resources tax lines on package**.
3.  Enter the quarter and the year for the reporting period.
4.  Click **OK** to transfer the information that will be used to generate the report about the tax on packing materials for the reporting period.
5.  Click **Create** &gt; **Create natural resources tax lines on items**.
6.  Enter the quarter and the year for the reporting period.
7.  Click **OK** to transfer the information that will be used to generate the report about the tax on dangerous materials.
8.  After the Natural resources tax lines are created, you can manually add or modify the information on each line.
