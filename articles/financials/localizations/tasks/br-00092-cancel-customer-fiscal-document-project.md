# Cancel a customer fiscal document (project) (Brazil)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

You can cancel a customer invoice for a project. When you cancel a project invoice, a negative project invoice is created. When you post the negative project invoice, the original and negative project invoices are marked as canceled, and all the ledger and financial transactions are reversed. The original transaction is reported as canceled in the fiscal books, but the negative transaction isn't reported in the fiscal books. You can't cancel a project invoice that is partially or fully settled. Additionally, you can't cancel a project invoice if the posting date of the invoice is in a fiscal period that is closed. This task uses the BRMF demo company.
