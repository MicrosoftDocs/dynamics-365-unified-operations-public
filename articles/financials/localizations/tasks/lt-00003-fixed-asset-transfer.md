# Generate a fixed asset transfer between warehouses document (Lithuania)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

If your organization needs to move a fixed asset from one department to another and the two departments are not in the same location, the transfer must be verified by a packing slip. You also need to generate a transfer packing slip if the employee responsible for the fixed asset is changed. Depending on the parameters that are enabled, the packing slip can be numbered automatically or manually.

This procedure applies only for Lithuanian functionality. 

The procedure was created using the demo data company USMF and requires changing USMF legal entity primary address to LTU manually before starting. 

This procedure is intended for accountants who are responsible for fixed assets.
