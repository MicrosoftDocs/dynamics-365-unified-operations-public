# Calculate CIAP credit amount (Brazil)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Every month, for each fiscal establishment, the tax credit amount is calculated for past fixed asset acquisitions for each fixed asset. This calculation occurs until the maximum number of tax credit installment payments is reached, or until the fixed asset no longer belongs to the legal entity. Each fixed asset tax credit installment payment is used to create a tax fiscal document that is part of the ICMS tax assessment for the legal entity. This task uses the BRMF demo company.
