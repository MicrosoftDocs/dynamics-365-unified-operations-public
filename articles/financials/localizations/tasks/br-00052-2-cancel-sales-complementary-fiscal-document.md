# Cancel a sales complementary fiscal document (Brazil)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

You can cancel an incorrect sales complementary fiscal document and provide a reason for the cancellation. When you cancel a sales complementary fiscal document, a sales complementary fiscal document is created that has a negative price amount, an Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) amount, or an Imposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) amount. When you post the negative sales complementary fiscal document, the original complementary fiscal document is marked as canceled, and all the ledger transactions and financial transactions are reversed. The original sales complementary fiscal document is reported in the fiscal books as canceled. The negative sales complementary fiscal document isn't reported in the fiscal books. This task uses the BRMF demo company.

1. Go to Accounts receivable > Fiscal documents > All sales complementary fiscal documents.
2. In the list, mark the selected row.
3. Click Cancel fiscal document to open the drop dialog.

5. Click Create corrected invoice.

6. Click Post.
    * When you post the negative sales complementary fiscal document, the original sales complementary fiscal document is marked as canceled.
