# Set up company bank accounts for ISO20022 credit transfers

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure shows how to set up company-specific bank account information that is required for payment file generation. You set up information required to generate ISO 20022 credit transfer format but depending on the format there might be other information required, such as the Company ID or the Sort code. 

The demo data company used to create this procedure is DEMF.
