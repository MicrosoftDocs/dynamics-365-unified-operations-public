2. Click New.
3. In the Over depreciation field, select an option.
    * Select Over depreciation = Ordinary depreciation.  
4. In the Under depreciation field, select an option.
    * Select Under depreciation = Additional depreciation (reserve).  
5. Click OK.
6. In the Filter by rule type field, select an option.
    * Select Filter by rule type = Carry forward of over depreciation or under depreciation amount.
