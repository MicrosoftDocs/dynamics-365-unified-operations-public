# Print a separate label for credit memos that originate from sales

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article explains how to specify the label that appears on credit memos that originate from sales.

On the **Legal entities** page, you can use the **Print corrective invoice on a sales memo** option on the **Foreign trade and logistics** tab to specify the label that appears on credit memos that originate from sales (sales orders, non-item sales, and project sales).

-   If the **Print corrective invoice on a sales memo** option is set to **No**, the label "Gutschrift" will be printed on all credit memos.
-   If the **Print corrective invoice on a sales memo** option is set to **Yes**, the label "Rechnungskorrektur” will be printed on credit memos from sales orders, free text invoices, and project invoices.
