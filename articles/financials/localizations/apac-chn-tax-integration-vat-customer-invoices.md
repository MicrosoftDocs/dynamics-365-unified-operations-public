You can generate value-added tax (VAT) customer invoices, and then export them as text files. You can then import reference numbers for the VAT customer invoices that can be linked to the original invoices.

Before you export a VAT customer invoice, you can split the VAT customer invoice to create multiple invoice documents. You can also combine multiple VAT customer invoices to create one invoice export document that contains the line details of the original invoices.

## What is a VAT customer invoice?
A VAT customer invoice is generated when you post a customer transaction that uses the sales tax group for VAT and the item sales tax group for VAT. You can generate a VAT customer invoice from a sales order, return sales order, credit note, free text invoice, or project sales invoice.

## Can I create one tax integration profile for multiple types of documents?

Yes. You can create one tax integration profile for multiple types of documents.

## When should I split a VAT customer invoice?
