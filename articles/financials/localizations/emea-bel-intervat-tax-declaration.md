# INTERVAT tax declaration

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides country/region-specific information about how to set up and create the INTERVAT tax declaration for legal entities in Belgium only.

You can create the INTERVAT tax declaration as an XML file. The INTERVAT declaration that you create can also include corrections from the previous year. Additionally, if you didn't have transactions for a turnover report or an annual listing during the previous financial year, you can indicate that this annual listing is an empty annual listing. Users can fill in correction data on the **Additional sales tax report boxes** page. In some cases, tax corrections are mandatory for the Belgian value-added tax (VAT) declaration. Examples are sales tax reporting codes 63 and 64, which are used for tax fines. Other examples are sales tax reporting codes 81, 82, 83, and so on. These codes aren't printed when the total amounts of the codes are negative. These negative amounts must be deducted from the next VAT declaration, when these cases are positive again. This task must be completed by using a tax correction. Before users make a tax correction, they must indicate which sales tax reporting codes are subject to tax corrections.

## Configure the ER model and format for the report

The system automatically generates an INTERVAT XML file and then offers to open it.

## Generate an INTERVAT summary tax declaration
To create an INTERVAT tax declaration for several tax periods and INTERVAT tax declaration IDs, click **Tax** &gt; **Inquiries and Reports** &gt; **Sales tax reports** &gt; **INTERVAT summary tax declaration**, and then use the filters to specify criteria for selecting data.
