# Reconciliation reports for Belgium

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic describes the standard reports that Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition provides to help you with the INTERVAT tax declaration and reconciliation analysis.

Based on the sales tax entries for selected periods, the Belgian periodic value-added tax (VAT) declaration combines sales tax amounts into boxes (sales tax reporting codes) by sorting, splitting, and totaling information in specific ways. Therefore, control reports are required, so that the amounts in the VAT declaration can be verified in detail. The rest of this topic describes the reports that include details of the data in the VAT declaration.

## Sales tax correction
The **Sales tax correction** report gives a printed overview of INTERVAT tax corrections. The correction amount is listed for each settlement period and sales tax box. (Sales tax boxes are Belgium-specific fields that are used to group VAT sales tax amounts in the VAT declaration. You set up these boxes in the **Sales tax reporting codes** table.) To print the **Sales tax correction** report, click **Tax** &gt; **Declarations** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Additional sales tax report boxes**, and then click **Tax corrections** &gt; **Print**.
