# Settle a partial vendor payment that has discounts on vendor credit notes

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article walks you through a scenario where a credit memo is settled against an invoice.

Fabrikam’s vendors give cash discounts on credit notes. Vendor 3050 lets Fabrikam take a cash discount of 1 percent if an invoice is paid in 14 days.

## Invoice and credit memo
On June 29, April creates an invoice for 1,000.00 for vendor 3050. On July 2, she creates a credit note for 200.00. From the **Vendors** page, April opens the **Settle transactions** page. She can use the **Settle transactions** page to mark both the credit note and the invoice for settlement. A discount of 2.00 is calculated on the credit note. Therefore, the total value of the credit note is reduced to 198.00.

| Mark                     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| Selected                 | Normal            | Inv-10070 | 3050    | 6/29/2015 | 7/29/2015 | 10070   | -1,000.00                      | USD      | -990.00          |
| Selected and highlighted | Normal            | CR-10070  | 3050    | 7/2/2015  | 7/29/2015 |         | 200.00                         | USD      | 198.00           |

Discount information for the credit note appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.

|                              |           |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Cash discount date           | 7/13/2015 |
| Cash discount amount         | 2.00      |
| Use cash discount            | Normal    |
| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |
| Cash discount amount to take | 2.00      |

April clicks **Post**. She then reviews the completed settlement. April sees that 198.00 of the credit note was applied, and a discount of 2.00 was taken. Therefore, the total is 200.00.

| Mark                     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice  | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| Selected and highlighted | Normal            | Inv-10070 | 3050    | 6/29/2015 | 7/29/2015 | 10070    | -1,000.00                      | USD      | -200.00          |
| Selected                 | Normal            | CR-10070  | 3050    | 7/2/2015  | 7/29/2015 | CR-10070 | 200.00                         | USD      | 198.00           |

April can review the vendor transactions on the **Vendor transactions** page by selecting a vendor on the **All vendors** page and then, on the Action Pane, click **Transactions**. On this page, April sees that the invoice has a balance of -800.00. She also sees a credit note for 198.00 and a discount of 2.00.
