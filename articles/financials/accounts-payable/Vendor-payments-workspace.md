# Vendor payments workspace

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The **Vendor payments** workspace shows information that is related to the processing of vendor payments. This workspace includes a **My work** view and an **Analytics** page. The **My work** view shows summary tiles, vendor transaction grids, and related vendor information. The **Analytics** page uses the capabilities of Microsoft Power BI to show visuals that are related to vendor payments.

## My work view

### Summary tiles

The tiles in the **Summary** section give an overview of the state of your payment information. You can see payment journals that aren't yet posted, invoices that are past due, all vendors, and vendors that are on hold. From the **Summary** section, you can create a new pay run.

The information in the **Summary** section is for the company that you're signed in to.

### Vendor transactions grids

The **Vendor transactions** section contains grids that show the invoices that are past due and payments that aren't settled. From the **Invoices past due** grid, you can view the settlement history for a selected invoice. From the **Payments not settled** grid, you can view the settlement history for a selected invoice and settle an invoice.

Centralized payment clerks can use a filter that appears at the top of each grid to select a company. The grid is then filtered so that it shows only those companies that are defined in the centralized payment organizational hierarchy that the centralized payment clerk has rights to view.

The **Find transactions** tab in the **Vendor transactions** section lets you search for a vendor transaction.

### Related information

You can view the **Vendor aging** report and the **Payment summary by date** report by using the links in the **Related information** section of the workspace.

## Analytics page

The **Analytics** page provides important metrics, such as vendor invoices that are past due and vendor invoices that are due in the future. This page contains nine report pages. One page provides an overview, and the other eight pages provide details about Accounts payable payment metrics.

The following table shows the visualizations that are available on each report page.
