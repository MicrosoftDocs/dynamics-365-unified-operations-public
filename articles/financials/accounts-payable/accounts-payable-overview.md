[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article describes the pages that you use to set up basic and optional functionality for Accounts payable in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. It also describes setup steps that you must complete before you start to set up Accounts payable.

Prerequisites for Accounts payable setup
----------------------------------------

Before you can set up Accounts payable, you must complete the following setup:

-   In General ledger:
    -   If you plan to use payment journals, set up payment journals.
    -   If you plan to run exchange rate adjustments, set up currency codes on the Currencies page, set up exchange rate types on the Exchange rate types page, and set up currency exchange rates on the Currency exchange rates page.
-   In Cash and bank management, set up bank accounts to use with methods of payment.

## Setup pages for Accounts payable

Use the following pages to set up the basic functionality of Accounts payable for each legal entity. The pages are listed in the recommended order of setup. To make the setup process easier, you can create templates from the first records that you create. In a template, values are typically entered in many fields to reflect the features that the organization wants to implement for a particular type of vendor.
1.  On the Terms of payment page, define the terms of payment that you assign to sales orders, purchase orders, customers, and vendors, and that determine invoice due dates. For more information, see [Define vendor payment fees](tasks/define-vendor-payment-fees.md).
2.  On the Methods of payment - vendors page, create and maintain information about how the organization pays its vendors.
3.  On the Vendor groups page, create and maintain groups of vendors that share important parameters for posting, settlement and payment, reporting, and forecasting.
