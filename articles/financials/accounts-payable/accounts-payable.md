# Accounts payable home page

This topic provides an overview of Accounts payable. 

You can enter vendor invoices manually or receive them electronically through a data entity. After the invoices are entered or received, you can review and approve the invoices by using an invoice approval journal or the **Vendor invoice** page. You can use invoice matching, vendor invoice policies, and workflow to automate the review process so that invoices that meet certain criteria are automatically approved, and the remaining invoices are flagged for review by an authorized user.

**Business processes**

deliveries and destinations, promissory notes, and other types of Accounts payable information.

## Configure vendor payments 

Assign a system-defined payment type, such as check, electronic payment, or promissory note, to any user-defined method of payment. 
Payment types are optional, but they are useful when you validate electronic payments and want to be able to quickly determine which payment type a payment uses.
