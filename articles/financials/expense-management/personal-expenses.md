# Personal expenses on an expense report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

During business travel, workers might sometimes charge personal expenses to their corporate credit cards. If you don't define a process for handling personal expenses, the approval process for expense reports might be disrupted when workers submit their itemized expense reports. 

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, there are two methods for handling a worker's personal expenses:

- **Paid by employee** – Your organization doesn't pay personal expenses that appear on the bill for the corporate credit card. Instead, it creates a 
report that shows personal expenses together with the corporate expenses that were charged to the corporate credit card.
- **Paid by company** – Your organization pays the whole bill for the corporate credit card and then debits the worker's account for the personal expenses.

You can select the method that your organization uses on the **Expense management parameters** page.
