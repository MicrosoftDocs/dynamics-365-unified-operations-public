# Expense management mobile workspace

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the **Expense management** mobile workspace. This workspace lets users capture and upload a receipt, so that they can attach it to an expense report later. Users can also quickly create an expense line by using an attached receipt, and create and manage their expense reports. Additionally, approvers can use the **Expense management** mobile workspace to view expense reports that are assigned to them, and either approve or reject those expense reports.


This mobile workspace is intended to be used with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Unified Operations mobile app.


## Overview

Many organizations require that a copy of a receipt be attached to a travel-related or business-related expense report that an employee submits for reimbursement. The **Expense management** mobile workspace lets users quickly create new expense lines on the mobile device of their choice by using an attached photo of a receipt. Alternatively, users can capture a photo of a receipt and then attach it to an expense report later. Employees can also create and manage their expense reports, and then submit them for approval and reimbursement by using their mobile device.


Specifically, the **Expense management** mobile workspace lets users perform these tasks:

- Take a photo of a receipt, and upload it to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. You can then attach that photo to an expense report later.
- Upload a file as a captured receipt. You can then attach that file to an expense report later.
- Create a new expense line by using an attached receipt. You can then add the line item to an expense report later, and submit it for approval and reimbursement.

If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017), you can also use these features:

- Create a new expense report.
- Attach credit card transactions and other previously created expenses to an expense report.
- Create new expenses for an expense report.
- Attach a receipt to any expense for an expense report, either by taking a photo of the receipt or by uploading a file as a captured receipt.
- Depending on the company's expense policy, add the list of guests to an expense.
- Depending on the company's expense policy, itemize expenses.
- Submit an expense report for approval and reimbursement.
- Approve or reject expense reports that you're an assigned approver for.
