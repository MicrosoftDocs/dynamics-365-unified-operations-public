# Set up workflows for expense

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
You can set up a workflow process that is used to review and approve travel and expense documents. The documents for which workflows
can be defined include expense reports, travel requisitions, and cash advance requests.

A workflow represents a business process. It defines how a document flows through the system and indicates who must complete a task 
or approve a document. There are several benefits of using the workflow system in your organization:

-   **Consistent processes** — You can define the approval process for specific documents, such as purchase requisitions and expense
      reports. Using the workflow system helps to ensure that documents are processed and approved in a consistent and efficient manner.

-   Process visibility — You can track the status, history, and performance metrics of a specific workflow instance. This helps you 
    determine whether changes should be made to the workflow to improve efficiency.

-   Centralized work list — Users can view a centralized work list to view the workflow tasks and approvals assigned to them.
