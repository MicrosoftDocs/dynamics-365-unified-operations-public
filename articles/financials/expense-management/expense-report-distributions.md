# Distributions on an expense report

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
When you enter expenses on an expense report, you can distribute the expense across multiple projects, financial dimensions, 
or accounts in your organization.

For example, Nancy, a Fabrikam sales representative, traveled from Copenhagen to Frankfurt. In Frankfurt, she met with two organizations
to discuss separate projects for each organization. Nancy spent seven business days working with organization A on project A, and three 
business days working with organization B on project B.

Because Nancy worked on two separate projects when she was in Frankfurt, when she enters her expense report, she distributes 
her expenses as appropriate for each project. The following table shows how Nancy distributed her expenses.

| **Expense type** | **Total expense amount** | **Amount distributed to project A** | **Amount distributed to project B** |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Train fare       | DKK 578                  | DKK 405                             | DKK 173                             |
| Hotel            | EUR 725                  | EUR 557                             | EUR 168                             |
| Meals            | EUR 346                  | EUR 284                             | EUR 62                              |
