# Set up prospects in the HR Recruiting app 

This article explains how to set up prospects in the HR Recruiting app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

A *prospect* is a potential applicant who fits a specific job role. Recruiters find these candidates and mark them as prospects. They can then send an invitation that the prospects can use to learn about the job opportunity and apply for the role. 


## Add candidates as prospects

A recruiter can use either of the following methods to add candidates as prospects in the Recruiting app.

- Create a new prospect in a job ad.

    1. On the menu, select **Job ads**.
    1. In the job ad list, select **Active job ads**.
    1. On the **Prospect** tab, select **New prospect**.
    1. In the dialog box, select the candidate to add as a prospect. Other information is automatically filled in.
    1. Select **Save** and then **Close**.

- Add prospects from candidates.

    1. In the list of available candidates, select one or more candidates to add as prospects.
    1. Select **Add as prospects**.
    1. In the dialog box, select one or more jobs to add the selected candidates to as prospects, and then select **Add**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > To close the dialog box, select **Close** or **X**.

    1. Go to the job ad where a prospect was added.
    1. On the **Prospect** tab, notice that the candidate is now a prospect.
 
## Turn prospects into applicants

Recruiters can turn prospects directly in applicants. 

To turn prospects into applicants, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Job ad** \> **Prospects**.
1. Select one or more prospects to turn into applicants.
1. Select **Move to applicant**.

The selected prospects are removed from the prospect list and now appear on the **Applicant** tab for the same job ad.

## Send an invitation to prospects

Recruiters can send an invitation to prospects to notify them about job openings. Prospects receive the notification by email.

## Delete prospects

To delete prospects, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Job ad** \> **Prospects**.
1. Select the prospects to delete.
1. Select **Delete prospect**.
