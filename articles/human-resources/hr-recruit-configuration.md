# Configuration in the HR Recruiting app 

This article explains how to configure the HR Recruiting app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources.


## Set up an email account

**Prerequisites:**

- Confirm that you have at least permission as a conditional access administrator role or equivalent permissions.
- Users and emails should be available in the tenant.
- In the Power Platform admin center, confirm that the added user and email account belongs to the Microsoft Power Platform environment and has the basic user role.
- Ensure that the email account has a valid Office license.

To enable users and email accounts to receive and send messages, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the Recruiting add-on app.
1. Go to **Settings** \> **Advanced settings**.
1. Select **Settings** \> **Email configuration**.
1. Select **Mailboxes**. You can ignore the pop-up message about approving the email.
1. Select **All mailboxes**.
1. Search for the user or email account, and select it.
1. Select **Approve email**.
1. Select **Test and enable mailbox**.
1. Confirm that the incoming and outgoing email status is **Success**.
    If the status isn't **Success** after you refresh the page, go to **Name** \> **Common** \> **Alerts** to find the error message.

1. The user that you assigned must follow these steps to allow other users to send email on their behalf:

    1. Sign in to the Recruiting add-on app.
    1. Go to **Settings** \> **Personalization settings** \> **Email**.

1. Set up a new flow for the new mail category/template.

## Create a hiring template

A hiring template is a template that a recruiter can use for multiple job postings. You can adjust the stages and steps to suit your needs. A *stage* is a round that a recruiter wants to conduct for each candidate. A *step* is an additional action that might be needed under a stage.

1. Select the stage that you want to create the step under.
1. Select **Save** and then **Close**.

### Screening template
A screening template is a template that recruiters use to store one or more questions. Templates can be used in multiple job ads so new questions don't need to be created for every job ad. 

### How to create screening template

To create a screening template, follow these steps:
1. Select the screening template from the left-side menu.
2. To generate a new template, click **+ New**.
3. Enter a name and description for your template.
4. After the template is saved, you'll have the option to add questions.

### Add questions to a screening template

1. Click **+ New** and a sidebar pops up.
2. Enter your question.
3. Select the **Answer type**:
 - For **Yes/No**, **Single-select**, or **Numeric answer** types, select the **Qualifying** checkbox to require a preferred answer for the question.
 - **Answer required** is selected by default.
         - If the candidate gives the preferred answer, they pass the screening; if not, they fail.
         - There can be more than one qualifying question.
