# Dynamics 365 Human Resources (preview) app

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]
[!include [preview banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Human Resources (preview) app is integrated with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources in a finance and operations environment. It helps organizations ensure that their employees can seamlessly request, edit, and cancel time off and leave of absence requests. The app provides an overall view of employee leave requests, leave balances, draft leave requests, and the leave requests for leave that was taken in the past. Managers can also use the app to view requests, and approve or reject them.

The Human Resources app can be used in Microsoft Teams or in a web browser. It can be used on both mobile devices and desktop devices. 

Administrators of an organization must install the Human Resources app and share it with Microsoft Teams before organization users can use it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Updates for the Human Resources app will be available. We don't recommend that you customize the app.

## Create and manage leave requests by using the Human Resources app

### View available balances

- Expand **Leave details**, and select **Available balances**.

    For each leave plan that's assigned to the signed-in user, a tile shows the available balance. You can request leave directly from a tile by selecting the **Request** button.

### Request leave

1. Select either the **Request** button on an available balance tile or the **Request time off** button. A new page contains **Leave type**, **Reason code**, **Start date**, and **End date** fields that must be set.
1. Select **Add**.
1. The selected number of days appears in **Selected dates**. Select **Edit days present** to update the details of the dates. For example, you might have to change the number of hours or a request for half-day leave.
1. Select **Edit day** to change the number of hours or a request for half-day leave. To remove a specific date from the date range, select the **Delete** (trashcan) button on the date tile. 
1. When you've finished making changes, select **Save**.
1. Add any comments and attachments that are required, and then select **Next**.
1. Review the details of the leave request. If everything looks correct, select **Submit**. Alternatively, you can save the leave request as a draft by selecting **Save as draft**. To cancel the action of creating a leave request, select **Cancel**. You can view draft and submitted leave requests in **Upcoming leaves**.

### Edit a leave request

1. Select the leave request that you want to edit, and then select **Edit leave**.
1. Update the leave request, and then submit it. If an approval workflow is associated with the leave type, it's submitted for approval again.

    To edit a single day in a leave request that includes more than one day, select the **Edit** button on the tile next to that day, and update the details. Then submit the request.

### Cancel a leave request

1. Select the leave request that you want to cancel, and then select **Delete leave**.
1. Select **Request cancellation**.

    To cancel a single day in a leave request that includes more than one day, select the **X** button on the tile next to that day, and then submit the request.

### Create a leave of absence request

1. Select **Request time off** or **Request leave of absence**.
1. Select the leave type, enter the start and end dates, and update the other details.

### View upcoming requests

- Expand **Leave details**, and select **Upcoming requests**.

    The app shows all draft leave requests in order of ascending date, followed by future leave requests in order of ascending date.

### View leave history

- Expand **Leave details**, and select **History**.

    The app shows all leaves that have an end date in the past.

### Approve or reject a leave request

Users who have the HR Manager or HR Absence manager role can use the Human Resources app to approve or reject leave requests for their direct reports on their team.

1. Expand **My team**, and select **Pending requests** to view open leave requests that are awaiting approval.
1. Select a leave request, and then select **Approve** or **Reject**.
