# Manage leave and absence requests

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

Manage time-off requests from the **Employee self-service** workspace in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Requests might be simple single-day requests or multiple-day requests that include multiple leave and absence types. If a workflow isn't enabled, the requests are automatically approved. When a workflow is enabled, the approval can be automatic or require sign-off, depending on the workflow configuration.

1. In the **Employee self-service** workspace, select **My team**.

2. Under **My team information**, select the **Leave and absence** tab.

3. View and approve your team members' time-off requests as necessary. You can select multiple leave requests.
