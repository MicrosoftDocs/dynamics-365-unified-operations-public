# Manage leave and absence requests

Managers can manage time-off requests from the **Employee self service** workspace in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Requests can be simple single-day requests or multiple-day requests that include multiple leave and absence types. If a workflow isn't enabled, the requests are automatically approved. If a workflow is enabled, the approval can be automatic, or it can require sign-off, depending on the workflow configuration.

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **My team**.

2. Under **My team information**, select the **Leave and absence** tab. 

3. View and approve your team members' time-off requests as necessary.
