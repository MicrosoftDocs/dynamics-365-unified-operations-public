[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

Manage time off requests from the **Employee self service** workspace in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Requests might be simple single day requests or multiple day requests that include multiple leave and absence types. If a workflow isn't enabled, the requests are automatically approved. When a workflow is enabled, the approval can be automatic or require sign off, depending on the workflow configuration.

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **My team**.

2. Under **My team information**, select the **Leave and absence** tab.

3. View and approve your team members' time off requests as necessary.

## Leave request workflow experience enhancements

This feature provides the following enhancements:

- You can select multiple leave requests and perform the same action on all of them.
- The ribbon across the top and a new workflow button on the page show the actions you can take on leave requests.
