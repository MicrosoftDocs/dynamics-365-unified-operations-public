# Employees select plans by using Employee self service (optional)


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

When a new employee is hired, or a life event occurs, the employee can use **Employee self service** to select or update their benefits during open enrollment.

To access their benefits for enrollment, the employee goes to **Employee self service** and then selects **Benefits self-service** on the **Benefits** tile.

On the **Benefits self-service** page, benefit plans are grouped by plan type. To view the benefit plans in a plan type, the employee selects a tile on the **Employee benefits** page. The employee will see only the benefits that they are eligible for.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before a plan type can be shown in **Employee self service**, it must be configured. For more information, see [Configure Employee self service](/dynamics365/human-resources/hr-benefits-setup-employee-self-service).

Depending on the plan type, one or more benefits can be selected for enrollment. For example, a medical plan type might be configured to limit the employee to one medical plan. A life insurance plan type might allow the employee to select multiple life insurance plans.

After the employee has decided which plan to enroll in, they might be required to select dependents. If the employee has selected a coverage option that is **Employee +1**, **Employee + children**, or **Family**, dependents must be selected. For more information about coverage options, see [Create coverage options](/dynamics365/human-resources/hr-benefits-setup-coverage-options).

To select a benefit plan, the employee selects either the ellipsis button (**...**) or **Add to cart**. After the employee has finished adding all the benefit selections to the cart, they select **View cart**. The employee is then taken to the **Plans** page, where they can view their selected and waived benefit plans.

The employee must select the **I agree** option before they can select the **Checkout** button. The statement that appears to the right of the **I agree** option can be customized on the **Benefits Management** tab of the **Human Resources Shared Parameters** page.

When the employee confirms their benefit plan selections by using **Employee self service**, those selections are recorded and shown on the **Worker benefit plans** and **Worker benefit plans bulk update** pages.

After the employee has selected their plans, the status of the benefits is shown as **Selected**. When the employee selects **Check out** on the **Benefits self-service** page, the **Checked Out** option will be selected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete enrollment, the benefits administrator must select **Confirm** for each employee benefit that is selected. Confirmation can be completed on the **Worker benefits plan** or **Worker benefit plans bulk update** page.
>

Employees aren't required to select benefits by using **Employee self service**. Benefits can be selected on behalf of an employee on the **Worker benefits plan** or **Worker benefit plans bulk update** page. The employee won't be enrolled in those benefits until the benefits administrator confirms them.
