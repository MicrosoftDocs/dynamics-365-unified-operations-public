# Change Employee self service workspace name


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

If you have volunteers or other non-employees, you might want to change the name of the **Employee self service** workspace. You can change this workspace to **Self service** instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the name of the **Employee self service** workspace also changes the menu item that is used internally by Dynamics 365 Human Resources. If you previously applied security customizations to the **HcmEmployeeSelfServiceWorkspace** menu item, we recommend applying the same changes to **HcmSelfServiceWorkspace** to maintain parity.

1. In Human Resources, select **Personnel management**, select **Links**, and then select **Human resources parameters**.

2. Select the **Employee self service** tab.

3. Under **Display name**, select **Self service**.

4. Select **Save**.
