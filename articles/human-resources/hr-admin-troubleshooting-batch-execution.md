# Reset stuck batch jobs


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

## Issue

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources can experience issues with batch jobs that are stuck in either an **Executing** or **Canceling** state and don't complete.

## Resolution

When a batch job is stuck in an **Executing** or **Canceling** state, you can reset the status by forcing the cancellation of the job. After you cancel it, you can reset the batch job by setting it to a **Waiting** status. It will then be picked up again for execution in the next scheduled batch run.

1. In the **System administration** workspace, select the **Links** page, and select **Batch jobs**.

2. On the **Batch job** list page, select the job that needs to be reset.

3. On the action ribbon, select **Force cancel**, and confirm the action.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Force cancel** action is only available when the selected batch job has a status of either **Executing** or **Canceling**, and no batch execution or cancellation processes are running for the job.

4. On the action ribbon, select **Change status**.

5. On the **Select new status** page, select **Waiting**, and then select **OK**.
