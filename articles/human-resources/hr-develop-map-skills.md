[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

You can create a skill-mapping search to find a qualified person in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Skill-mapping searches return results for criteria you enter by looking through the following information:

- Skills
- Education
- Certificates
- Positions
- Project experience

For example, you can find people in your organization who have earned their CPA.

Skill-mapping profiles allow you to find current employees or candidates with qualifications that directly correspond to business needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Only workers, applicants, and contact persons who are selected to be included in skill-mapping searches will display in a skill-mapping results list, or be included in a skill profile. To include a person in skill mapping searches, set the **Include in skill mapping** selection to **Yes** in the following pages:<br>
> - Worker<br>
> - Employee<br>
> - Applicant<br>
> - Contacts<br>

To create a skill mapping, go to **Employee development > Links > Skill mapping**. To create a skill-mapping profile, go to **Employee development > Links > Skill mapping profiles**.

## Skill gap analysis and skill profile analysis

You can create a skill profile analysis to view a list of a person's competencies. You can create a skill gap analysis to compare a person’s skills and the skills required for a job.

To create a gap analysis, go to **Employee development > Links > Skill gap analysis job - person**. To create a skill profile analysis, go to **Employee development > Links > Skill profile analysis**.
