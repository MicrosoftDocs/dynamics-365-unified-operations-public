[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

[!include [rename-banner](~/includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This topic lists frequently asked questions about the infrastructure merge for Dynamics 365 Human Resources to the Finance and Operations app platform. 

## What is the Dynamics 365 Human Resources infrastructure merge? 

Dynamics 365 Human Resources is a stand-alone application that uses a different infrastructure than the Finance and Operations apps. This infrastructure merge will bring Dynamics 365 Human Resources into the same infrastructure as the other Finance and Operations apps, like Finance, Supply Chain Management, Project Operations, and Commerce.  

## Value and benefit of the infrastructure merge

### Our organization uses Dynamics 365 Human Resources to manage our HR operations. What benefits will we see from these changes? 

-	Elimination of multiple sets of HR capabilities within Dynamics 365.
-	Provide both Power Platform extensibility and a way to extend business logic and feature options.
-	Bring consistency between Dynamics 365 Human Resources and other Finance and Operations apps in terms of Application Life Cycle Management, Lifecycle Services (LCS), geographic availability, extensibility, and more
-	Take advantage of shared services, tooling, and reduce costs.

### Our organization uses the HR module within Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, or Project Operations.  What benefits will we see from these changes?

The capabilities and investments that have been made in Dynamics 365 Human Resources will now be available to those customers that are using the HR module within Dynamics 365 Finance. Some of these capabilities include Leave and absence management, Benefits management, Task management, and more.  

### Will I lose any features or capabilities that I use today?

There will be functional parity with both Dynamics 365 Human Resources and the Finance and Operations apps HR Module. Dynamics 365 Human Resources will take precedence for like features. For more information, see [Feature management overview](fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). 

### Will the experience change for my users?

The new HR capabilities will be managed through Feature Management. Customers are in control on whether they want to uptake these new features. In some instances, capabilities may be modified. In those cases, documentation will be provided. 

### How does this change impact me if I am an existing customer using the HR module on the Operations infrastructure and the Dynamics 365 Human Resources application, through custom integrations?

The custom integration between Dynamics 365 Human Resources and the Finance HR module will no longer be needed. All human resources data will reside in the same database as the other Finance and Operations apps. 

## Migration from Dynamics 365 Human Resources to Finance and Operations apps

### Our organization uses Dynamics 365 Human Resources to manage my HR operations. What do we need to plan for to migrate to the new experience?

If your organization uses Dynamics 365 Human Resources but doesn’t use any other Finance and Operations apps, then your Human Resources environment will be migrated to the new infrastructure, with much of the process being automated. Processes will be in place to migrate your database and synchronize it to the new infrastructure. 

Tooling will be in place to allow you to test the migration process and validate your data and experience prior to migrating your production environment. 

If your organization uses both Dynamics 365 Human Resources and otherFinance and Operations apps, then you will need to plan more time for validation to ensure that your data migrates correctly to the new environment. The migration to the new infrastructure will merge the data from your Human Resources environment with your Finance and Operations environment. Tooling will be in place to automate as much as the data merge process as possible. But there will be instances of conflicting data that will need user input to define how to resolve the conflict. Users and administrators will need to manage these data mappings where there are conflicts and test the migration in sandbox environments prior to migrating your production environment.

### Our organization uses the HR module within Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, or Project Operations.  What do we need to plan for to migrate to the new experience?

For organizations using the Human Resources module in Finance and Operations apps, the new feature functionality from Dynamics 365 Human Resources will be applied to your environment through the standard One Version update process. You can expect to see the new functionality in your environment as it becomes available in each update. You can use Feature Management to enable these features. You should plan to do validations on these new features following the processes you have in place for validating other updates to your environment. For more information about how updates are applied to Finance and Operations apps, see [One Version overview](/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/oneversion-overview.md).

### When will my organization be migrated? 

The migration for each organization will depend on their current configuration and readiness to migrate to the new infrastructure. These dates are subject to change.
-	Organizations currently using the Human Resources module in Finance and Operations apps will receive the HR functionality for Dynamics 365 Human Resources as part of the regular One Version update process. New features are planned to be generally available beginning in October 2021.
-	Organizations currently using only Dynamics 365 Human Resources will have access to migration tooling to begin testing and start the migration beginning mid-2022. The date by which the migration to the new infrastructure has not yet been determined but will be at least one year following the date when migration tooling becomes available.
-	Organizations currently using both Dynamics 365 Human Resources and other Finance and Operations apps will have access to migration tooling to begin testing and start the migration beginning late 2022. The date by which the migration to the new infrastructure has not yet been determined by will be at least one year following the date when migration tooling becomes available.

For more information about the new features for Dynamics 365 Human Resources, see [What's new or changed in Human Resources](/hr-admin-whats-new.md).

### I am using new capabilities that are only available in Dynamics 365 Human Resources (such as leave management and benefits management). Will these now be available in the HR module on the Operations infrastructure as well? 

Yes. These modules would work as-is in Finance and Operations apps with 100% feature parity. Customer data for customers using these capabilities in HR today would be migrated to continue working on the Operations system as a part of the overall migration strategy. 

### I use the new Dynamics 365 Human Resources benefits management and have built custom integrations with the HR module on the Finance and Operations app infrastructure to leverage the payroll capabilities using benefits data. Will this be required going forward? 

As part of the infrastructure merge includes bringing human resources data into the same database as the other Finance and Operations applications. Integration between modules in Finance and Operations apps will no longer be required. 

### Our organization uses one or more ISV solutions with Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Will my ISV solutions be migrated automatically?

The migration experience for each ISV solution will vary based on the integration method of the solution. We will work closely with ISVs to enable a smooth transition to the new infrastructure.

### Our organization uses LinkedIn Talent Hub integrated with Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Will this integration continue to work after the infrastructure change is completed?

Yes, the LinkedIn Talent Hub integration will continue to work after the migration to the new infrastructure.

### Our organization uses the Human Resources app for Microsoft Teams. Will the app continue to work after the infrastructure change is completed?

Yes, the Human Resources app for Microsoft Teams will continue to work after the migration to the new infrastructure.

### Our organization has configured custom security in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Will our custom security still be applied after the infrastructure change is completed?

Yes, custom security configurations will be included in the data migration to the new infrastructure. 

### We are using Data integrator to move data between Dynamics 365 Human Resources and other apps within Dynamics 365. How will the data that is currently being integrated be affected?

Human resources data that is currently mastered in the Dynamics 365 Human Resources is synchronized with Microsoft Dataverse. Data Integrator can then be used for a one-way sync with other Dynamics 365 apps. Following the migration to the new infrastructure, human resources data will be native to the other Finance and Operations apps. Data integrator will no longer be needed to synchronize the data between Finance and Operations apps and Human Resources.

The current Dataverse native data tables for Human Resources will continue to synchronize the data from the environment on the new infrastructure. The entities will be converted to support dual Write. Any other data integrations configured with Data Integrator against these tables for other Dynamics 365 apps will continue to work as currently configured.

### We are using Dual-write to move HR data between Microsoft Dataverse and other Finance and Operations apps within Dynamics 365. How will the data that is currently being integrated be affected by the migration to the new infrastructure?

HR data will be native to the Finance and Operations apps in the environment on the new infrastructure. Dual-write will then be used to move HR data between the new environment and the Dataverse environment.

### We have built custom integrations with Dynamics 365 Human Resources to one or more external systems. Will we need to develop new integrations after the infrastructure change is completed?

It depends on the integration endpoint. For more information about the integration technologies available with Finance and Operations apps and choosing the best integration technology, see [Integration overview](/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/integration-overview.md).

### We have extended Dataverse for Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Will these extensions be migrated automatically?

If the Dynamics 365 Human Resources and Finance and Operations apps environments that will be joined in the environment on the new infrastructure are connected to the same Dataverse environment, then the two apps will continue to be connected to the same Dataverse environment following the migration. This means that no migration is needed for any Dataverse extensions.

If the Dynamics 365 Human Resources and Finance and Operations apps environments are currently connected to separate Dataverse environments, then the two Dataverse environments will also need to be combined to be connected to the single environment on the new infrastructure. For this Dataverse migration, the Dataverse tables that are standard to the Human Resources solutions can be connected and resynchronized to the new Dataverse environment. Any extensions to the Dataverse environment, however, will not be migrated automatically. The extensions would need to be redeployed in the new environment. It is recommended to use managed solutions to manage your application extensions on the Dataverse. For more information, see [Introduction to solutions](/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/introduction-solutions.md).

### We have configured Power Automate flows and/or Power Apps to work with Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Will these Power Platform components be migrated and work automatically after the infrastructure change is completed?

Power Apps, Power Automate flows, and other Power Platform customizations are similar to Dataverse extensions. Whether these work automatically following the migration to the new infrastructure is dependent on whether the Human Resources app and the Finance and Operations apps are connected to the same Power Apps environment prior to the migration. If the apps are currently connected to the same Power Apps environment, they will continue to be connected to that same Power Apps environment following the migration to the new infrastructure. In this case, Power Apps, Power Automate flows, and other Power Platform customizations will continue to work without any need for additional configuration. It is recommended to use managed solutions to manage your application extensions on the Dataverse. For more information, see [Introduction to solutions](/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/introduction-solutions.md).

If the Human Resources app and Finance and Operations apps are connected to separate Power Apps environments, then they will need to be combined as part of the migration. This will require any Power Apps and other customizations to be redeployed in the new environment.

### We have enabled Dataverse virtual tables for Dynamics 365 Human Resources. What will happen to these tables during the migration?

If the environment on the new infrastructure following the migration remains connected to the Dataverse environment currently connected to Dynamics 365 Human Resources, then the Dataverse virtual tables that have been generated in the environment will continue to work without any additional configuration.

If the environment on the new infrastructure following the migration is connect to a different Dataverse environment, then the virtual tables will need to be regenerated in the new Dataverse environment.

### We have developed an integration using the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) API, Payroll API, Dataverse virtual tables for Dynamics 365 Human Resources, or other entities in the Dataverse Web API. Will these integrations continue to work after the infrastructure change is completed?

If the environment on the new infrastructure remains connected to the Dataverse environment currently connected to Dynamics 365 Human Resources, then any integrations developed against the Dataverse Web API will continue to work once the migration is completed.

If the environment on the new infrastructure following the migration is connected to a different Dataverse environment, then any integrations developed against the Dataverse Web API will need to be reconfigured to connect to the new Dataverse environment.

### Is there an impact on the Azure region when my environment is migrated?

The Human Resources environment will typically stay within the same Azure region for the migration. The only exception is if the Human Resources environment will be merged with a Finance and Operations environment that is in a different region. In this case, the Human Resources environment will be migrated to the Azure region of the Finance and Operations apps environment.

### Our organization is dependent on workflows in Dynamics 365 Human Resources for one or more business processes. Will the workflows be migrated automatically? 

Yes, workflow configurations, workflow history, and current in-process workflows will be migrated.

### What training and resources will be available to help with the migration process?

Full documentation will be provided with detail for each step of the migration process. Additional training resources such as videos and workshops may also be available depending on need.

### Our organization has created Saved views in Dynamics 365 Human Resources to improve the usability of the interface. Will the Saved views be migrated automatically?

Yes, Saved views will be migrated to the new infrastructure.

### We are using Ceridian with Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Will the Ceridian integration be available after the infrastructure change is completed? 

The integration to Ceridian will be migrated to the Payroll API based integration. The file-based integration that exists today in Dynamics 365 Human Resources will not be migrated to the Finance and Operations infrastructure. For more information, see [Payroll API introduction](/hr-admin-integration-payroll-api-introduction.md).

### How will the service update process be affected by the migration?

Customers will have much more flexibility in application lifecycle management (ALM) and service updates following the migration. Rather than having service updates applied automatically to Human Resources environments, the service will follow One Version service update processes and functionality, enabling configuration options for updates through Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information, see [One Version overview](/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/oneversion-overview.md).

### How will the migration affect my LCS project for Dynamics 365 Human Resources?

The migration to the new infrastructure will move management of your Dynamics 365 Human Resources environments into an LCS implementation project. If the migration is merging Dynamics 365 Human Resources with an existing Finance and Operations environment, then your Human Resources LCS project will be merged into the LCS implementation project for the Finance and Operations app. If you are currently using only Dynamics 365 Human Resources, then a new LCS implementation project will be created and your existing Human Resources LCS project will be migrated to the new project. 

The new project will be the same type used by Finance and Operations apps and will have the same features and functionality for environment management. For more information, see [Lifecycle services resources](/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs.md)

### We have linked our task recordings to the Business Process Modeler in Human Resources. How will the Business Process Modeler be migrated and merged into the LCS?

Business process libraries for the LCS project will be migrated to the new LCS project for Human Resources.

### Our organization only uses Dynamics 365 Human Resources today. What resources are available to learn more about the development capabilities after the infrastructure change is completed?

Both Power Platform extensibility and Finance and Operations extensibility options will be available to be used for development. For more information, see [Develop and customize home page](/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/developer-home-page.md).

### We have enabled features in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Will these features be automatically enabled during the migration?

Whether a feature is enabled in the new infrastructure automatically will be determined individually for each feature and will be included in the feature documentation.

### What happens to my BYOD database during the migration?

Import and export configurations for bring your own database (BYOD) will be migrated to the new infrastructure.

### What happens to my Azure Data Lake during the migration?

Any export currently configured for Azure Data Lake in Finance and Operations apps will maintain the same configuration following the migration.

### We are currently using Dynamics AX 2012. Will the upgrade tools currently available now be used to upgrade the HR module in AX 2012 to the new Dynamics 365 Human Resources application?

Yes. Dynamics 365 Human Resources will be included in the merged Finance and Operations apps codebase and infrastructure. Upgrading from Dynamics AX 2012 to Dynamics 365 Human Resources will follow the same upgrade path and tooling used to upgrade to the latest version of Finance and Operations apps.

### We use Document handling with Dynamics 365 Human Resources. What will happen to these documents during the migration?

The documents will remain in the existing document storage and are remapped to the environment in the new infrastructure.

### What happens to the batch jobs we have configured in Dynamics 365 Human Resources after the migration?

Applicable batch jobs will be automatically migrated to the new infrastructure.

## Licensing Impact
This documentation does not supersede or replace any of the legal documentation covering use rights. 

### Our organization uses Dynamics 365 Human Resources to manage our HR operations. Does my licensing or cost change?

Customers that have purchased the Dynamics 365 Human Resources licenses will not be impacted.  There is no licensing migration for them. The additional sandbox SKU that was specific for Human Resources will no longer be applicable. Instead, customers can choose to buy a Finance and Operations apps Tier 2 sandbox at a slightly lower cost. Existing customers who have purchased a Human Resources sandbox will be migrated to a Finance and Operations apps Tier 2 Sandbox at no additional cost. 

### Our organization uses the HR module within Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, or Project Operations.  Does my licensing or cost change?

Existing Dynamics 365 apps and standalone Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, and Project Operations users can access the Human Resources module as part of these licenses until February 2025 or when the current licensing agreement expires, whichever is earlier. You can choose to move to Human Resources licenses earlier if it helps you achieve better cost saving. Starting from February 2025, all existing CSP and EA customers must roll off HR module and buy Human Resources licenses to take advantage of the new capabilities being brought to the Finance and Operations apps.

### Our organization is live with Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, or Project Operations. Will we be required to purchase an additional environment to support the infrastructure merge?

Additional environments aren’t required to support the infrastructure change. 

### Where should I go if I have additional product licensing questions?
