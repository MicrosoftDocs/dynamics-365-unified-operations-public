[!include [banner](../../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article lists features that are new or changed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources version 10.0.41. This version has a build number of 10.0.2015.16 and is available on the following schedule:

- **General availability of release (auto-update):** October 2024

## Features included in this release

This section contains a table that lists the features that are included in this release when available. We might update this article to include features that were added to the build after this article was originally published.

| Module or feature area | Feature name | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Leave and absence | Human Resources app for Leave and absence | The Human Resources app for leave and absence is integrated with Dynamics 365 Human Resources. This integration helps organizations ensure that their employees can seamlessly request, edit, and cancel time off and leave of absence requests. Employees can view leave balances, upcoming leaves, and leave history in one app. Managers can use the app to view requests, and approve or reject them. |

## Feature enhancements included in this release

This section contains a table that lists the enhancements that are included in this release when available. We might update this article to include features that were added to the build after this article was originally published.

| Feature name | More information |
|---|---|
| Include weekends and holidays | The **Include weekends and holidays** functionality is improved. Holidays and weekends are now separated. Therefore, users have the flexibility to select one or both when they set up a leave type. |
| Streamlined employee entry | The streamlined employee entry page was previously scheduled to become mandatory in the Dynamics 365 Human Resources version 10.0.41 release. However, the schedule was extended. The page is becoming mandatory in version 10.0.43 instead. |
| Additional payroll entities | Additional entities are available for Dynamics 365 Human Resources payroll integration. |

## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.41. Most features that have been turned on atomically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory. This change ensures that customers are using current functionality, so that as enhancements are added, they can build on the current functionality. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they're determined to be essential.

| Feature name | Feature state | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Set primary position for a hire | Mandatory | Human Resources |
| Open ended leave | Mandatory | Human Resources |
| Inclusion of closed days and holidays for leave and absence | On by default | Human Resources |
