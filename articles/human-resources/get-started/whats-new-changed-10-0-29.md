## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that made it into the build after this 
article was initially published.

| Feature name | Overview | Release status |
|----|----|----|
| Specify location owner | This feature lets system administrators specify the owner of a location (address). | Default |
| Benefits notification | This preview feature enables email notifications and reminders to be sent to employees in the new hire enrollment, open enrollment, and qualifying life event scenarios.

You can also track the notifications and reminders history. | Preview |

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature name | More information |
|--------------|------------------|
| Task management | Additional entities have been created to support notification options via Dataverse. HCMProcessTaskAssignment contains the assignment type, legal entity, assigned worker's name, assigned worker's personnel number, and assigned worker's primary email address. All business process types are included in the single entity (Onboarding, Offboarding, and Transition). If the task has been assigned to a group, each member of the group will be a line in the entity. The demo data for the Task Management Calendar has been updated through 2030. |
| Security configuration | <p>The following self-service roles have been added to the security configuration and map to the stand-alone HR self-service roles:</p><ul><li>Self-service manager</li><li>Self-service employee</li><li>Self-service contractor</li></ul><p>The self-service roles do **not** include time sheet entry or expense, because access to those areas requires Team Member licensing. The roles in the preceding list should be used for the HR Self Service license. |
| Life events | Multiple updates have been made to the life event experience in Benefits Management. | 

## Features on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.29. Most features that have been turned on automatically can be turned off in Feature management. In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory to ensure that customers are using current functionality. In this way, enhancements can build on the current functionality as they are added. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year unless they are determined to be essential.
