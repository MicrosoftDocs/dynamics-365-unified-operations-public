## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default or are now mandatory in version 10.0.39. Most features that have been turned on automatically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory. This change is made to ensure that customers are using current functionality. In this way, as enhancements are added, they can build on the current functionality. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they're determined to be essential.
