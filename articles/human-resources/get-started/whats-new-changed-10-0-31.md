## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing 
feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature name | More information |
|--------------|------------------|
| Task management | Previously, when updates were made to a task, the user had to go to each checklist that contained the task and update the tasks individually. Changes in the 10.0.30 release added the option to update checklist tasks when a library task is edited. For those edits to be applied to all associated checklist tasks, a relationship must already exist between the task in the task library and the task in the checklist. Before the 10.0.30 release, a relationship wasn't created. An upgrade has been created to create the relationship between the library task and the checklist task. |
