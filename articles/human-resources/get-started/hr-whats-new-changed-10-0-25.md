# Preview of Dynamics 365 Human Resources 10.0.25 (April 2022)

[!include [banner](../../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This topic lists features that are new or changed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources version 10.0.25. This version has a build number of 10.0.1149 and is available as 
follows:

Management. For more information about the infrastructure merge, see [Dynamics 365 Human Resources infrastructure merge FAQ](/human-resources/hr-infrastructure-merge-faq.md)
