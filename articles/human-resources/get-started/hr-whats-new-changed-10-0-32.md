## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing 
feature. Because they're only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature name | More information | 
|--------------|------------------|
| Configure required attachment for leave requests | This feature helps organizations determine when an attachment is required while a leave request is created. For example, depending on the leave request type, an attachment might be required when a leave request is created, updated, or canceled. |

## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default or are now mandatory in version 10.0.32. Most features that have been turned on automatically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory. This change is made to ensure that customers are using current functionality. In this way, as enhancements are added, they can build on the current functionality. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they're determined to be essential.
