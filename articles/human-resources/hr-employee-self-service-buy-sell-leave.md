# Buy and sell leave

In Dynamics 365 Human Resources, you can submit requests to buy and sell leave based on the buy and sell leave policies set up by your company.  

## Request to buy leave

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **Buy leave request** in the **Time Off Balances** tile. 

2. Add a **Leave type** and enter an **Amount** for the amount of leave you'd like to buy. 

3. Select **Submit** when you're ready to submit your request. 

Your balances will either automatically update or go through an approval process before updating. This depends on how the buy policy has been configured.
