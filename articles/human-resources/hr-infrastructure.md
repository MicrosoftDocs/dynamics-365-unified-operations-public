# Dynamics 365 Human Resources infrastructure merge - Release 10.0.25 update

The 10.0.25 release brings the first wave of capabilities in the infrastructure merge. During the infrastructure merge, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources will be merged with the Finance and Operations infrastructure. However, it will continue to be licensed as an independent application, like Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. For more information about the infrastructure merge, see [Dynamics 365 Human Resources infrastructure merge FAQ](../human-resources/hr-infrastructure-merge-faq.md).

The merge will provide consistency for Human Resources users in the following ways:

- [Environment management and integrations are consistent between Human Resources and Finance and Operations apps.](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/human-resources/dynamics365-human-resources/consistent-environment-management-integrations-between-human-resources-finance-operations-apps)

    - Manage environments in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services, issue search, and Regression Suite Automation Tool.
    - There is a single code base, where new functionality for Human Resources is released as part of the regular One Version update process.
    - The way that upgrades, updates, and hotfixes are applied to environments is consistent.

- [Extensibility options are improved.](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/human-resources/dynamics365-human-resources/improve-extensibility-options)

    - You can continue to use Microsoft Power Platform tools to extend as required.
    - You can extend functionality via forms, tables, methods, and application programming interfaces (APIs).
    - You can create and extend entities.

    For more information about the extension options that are available, see [Overview of extensibility in Dynamics 365](../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/extensibility/extensibility-home-page.md).

- [Create one set of human resources capabilities in Dynamics 365.](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/human-resources/dynamics365-human-resources/create-one-set-human-resources-capabilities-within-dynamics-365)

    In the 10.0.25 release, functional capabilities that existed only in Human Resources have been made available on the Finance and Operations infrastructure. For customers to take advantage of these capabilities in a Finance and Operations environment, the following Human Resources features must be enabled in Feature Management.
