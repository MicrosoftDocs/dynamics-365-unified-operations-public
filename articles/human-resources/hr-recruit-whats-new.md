This article provides information about the Recruiting solution that helps to find and hire the best and most qualified candidate for a job opening. For more information, 
see [Recruiting overview](hr-recruit-overview.md).

## January 2026
The January release of the Recruiting solution version contains the following feature enhancements and bug fixes. 

| Feature  | Description |
| --- |--- |
|Job ad enhancement |	Job ad description can be edited after posting the job.|
|Rehire	 |The rehire feature allows former employees to apply for job positions using their previous employee email address, enabling recruiters to rehire them rather than processing a standard hire.  |
|Location data improvements in careers  |	In Careers, candidates can now view full country/region names in the lookup feature, making it easier to select the correct country/region. Candidates can enter city and postal code as free text, even if no state is provided for a country/region. This feature is included in Dynamics 365 finance and operations version 10.0.46. For instructions on enabling this feature in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.45, see [HR Recruiting app known issues](hr-recruit-known.md#known-issues-and-limitations).|
|Quick view for notes and feedback	 |Recruiters and hiring managers can now add comments and view panel member feedback directly in the side panel, without needing to open the applicant's details.|
|Calendar view for find slot in interview scheduling |	The **Calendar view** feature streamlines the process of finding suitable time slots for interview panel members. This visual interface provides a clear 
overview of each panel member’s availability, making scheduling more efficient and reducing back-and-forth communication. The inclusion of a legend (Available slot, Busy slot, Selected slot, Confirmed slot, Sent 
for confirmation) ensures that users can quickly interpret the status of each slot, promoting transparency and ease of use throughout the interview scheduling process.|
