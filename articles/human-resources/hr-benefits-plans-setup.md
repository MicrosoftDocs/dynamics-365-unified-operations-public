This topic shows how to set up benefit plans in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

Each plan type specifies whether an employee can enroll in multiple plans of that type, specifies whether contacts are beneficiaries or dependents, and defines coverage options. You can create new custom plan types to meet the needs of your benefits offerings. Main benefit plan types are: <ul><li>401K</li><li>ADD</li><li>Dental</li><li>Fitness</li><li>FSA</li><li>Life</li><li>LTD</li><li>Medical</li><li>PTO</li><li>STD</li><li>Vision</li></ul> |

   | **Master** | Specifies whether the plan is the master plan within the bundle it is assigned to. |
   | **Valid from date and time** | The date and time the plan starts. The default value is the current system date. |
   | **Valid to date and time** | The date and time the plan ends. The default value is 12/31/2154, which signifies never. |
