This article shows you how to set up benefit plans in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

1. In the **Benefits management** workspace, under **Plans**, select **Benefit plans**.

   | --- | --- |
   | Plan | A unique identifier for the plan. |
   | Description | A description of the plan. |
   | Plan type | When you create a new plan, you need to specify the plan type. A plan type is a high-level grouping of specific types of benefits. Each plan type specifies whether an employee can enroll in multiple plans of that type, specifies whether contacts are beneficiaries or dependents, and defines coverage options. You can create new custom plan types to meet the needs of your benefits offerings. Main benefit plan types are: <ul><li>401K</li><li>ADD</li><li>Dental</li><li>Fitness</li><li>FSA</li><li>Life</li><li>LTD</li><li>Medical</li><li>PTO</li><li>STD</li><li>Vision</li></ul> |
   | Plan type code | The plan type code of the plan type. |
   | Program | Specifies a program to optionally assign the plan to. |
   | Bundle | Specifies a bundle to optionally assign the plan to. |
   | Master | Specifies whether the plan is the master plan within the bundle it is assigned to. |
   | Status | Indicates the current status of the benefits plan. The default value is Active. If you change the status to Inactive, the plan won’t be available as a selection during enrollment. |
   | Valid from date and time | The date and time the plan starts. The default value is the current system date. |
   | Valid to date and time | The date and time the plan ends (the status is set to Inactive). The default value is 12/31/2154, which signifies never. |

4. On the **Configuration** tab, specify values for the following fields, depending on the type of plan you're creating:

   | Plan type | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |

For example, if the incremental amount is 1,000, an employee can’t have $200,500 of insurance, they would need to round up to $201,000 or down to $200,000. |

## Attach coverage options

You can add coverage options to the selected benefits plan. Attaching coverage options brings the rate and deduction setup together for a coverage option.  Example:  For a medical plan, the user would select a Family coverage option.
