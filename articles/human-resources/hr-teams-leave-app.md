# Manage leave requests in Teams

[!include [banner](includes/preview-feature.md)]

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources app in Microsoft Teams lets you quickly request time off and view your time-off balance information right in Microsoft Teams. You can interact with a bot to request information and start a leave request. The **Time off** tab provides more detailed information. You can also send people information about your upcoming time off in teams and chats outside the Human Resources app.

## Install the app

You can find the Human Resources app in the Teams store.

1. In Microsoft Teams, select the ellipses.

   ![Human Resources Teams leave app ellipses](./media/hr-teams-leave-app-ellipses.png)
 
2. Search for Dynamics 365 Human Resources, and then select the **Human Resources** tile.

   ![Human Resources Teams leave app HR tile](./media/hr-teams-leave-app-human-resources-tile.png)

3. Select the **Add** button to install the app.

   ![Human Resources Teams leave app install](./media/hr-teams-leave-app-in-store.png)

If the app doesn't automatically sign you in, select the **Settings** tab to sign in.

![Human Resources Teams leave app Settings tab](./media/hr-teams-leave-app-settings-tab.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don’t see a sign-in dialog box, check your browser settings to allow pop-ups. 

If you have access to more than one instance of Human Resources, you can select which environment you want to connect to in the **Settings** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> The app now supports the System Administrator security role.
 
## Use the bot

After the app installs, a welcome message appears, letting you know the types of actions the bot can take on your behalf.

> [!NOTE]
> When first interacting with the bot, you might need to sign in. If you don’t see a sign-in dialog box, check your browser settings to allow pop-ups.

You can ask the bot to:

- Show time-off balance information for each leave type you're enrolled in.

- Show additional details about a specific leave type.

- Start a leave request for you.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble signing into or using the Human Resources Teams app, try following these troubleshooting instructions. If you're still having problems after troubleshooting, contact Support. For more information, see [Get support](hr-admin-troubleshooting-support.md).

### Can't sign into the Human Resources app in Teams

If you can't sign into the app, it's possible that the account you're using to sign into Microsoft Teams isn't associated with an employee record in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Contact your system administrator to ensure your employee record is correctly associated.

### Error when approving leave requests in the Human Resources app in Teams

If you receive an error when you're trying to approve leave requests in the Teams app, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify that the account you're using to sign into Microsoft Teams is the same one you use for accessing Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

2. Verify that you're a valid approver for the request by checking the workflow settings for leave approval. For more information about leave request workflows, see [Create a leave request workflow](hr-leave-and-absence-workflow.md).

## Known accessibility issues

The Human Resources app in Teams has the following accessibility issues that we're working on fixing in future releases.

| Issue | Workaround or explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Zooming to 400% on desktop hides some of the action buttons from view. | We recommend using a magnifier instead until we can support this zoom level. |
| On the **Time off** tab, voiceover announces a button action while reading the header for the time-off grid. | The header and elements within the grid are grouped by year, and they're collapsible. Voiceover interprets this as an actionable item, but it isn't. |
| On the **Time off** tab, there's an extra swipe gesture when navigating to **Reason code** in a new request. | There is no hidden control that the swipe navigation is trying to get to. |
| On the **Time off** tab, if you swipe while the calendar is open, you end up outside the control instead of at the top in a new request or while editing a request. | When you reach **Go to today**, consider that to be the end of the control and swipe in the reverse direction to get back to the top. |
| Voiceover doesn't read the labels for dates. | The dates encountered in pairs are always **Start date** and **End date**. |
| On the **Chat** tab, the focus jumps back to the top when you enter a date while using the assistive tool or keyboard navigation. | Tab until you reach your input area again. |

### Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)

With the Dynamics 365 Human Resources bot in Microsoft Teams, the user’s text inputs are analyzed for understanding the underlying query/intent. The user’s input such as “Search account Contoso” is routed to one of Microsoft’s Cognitive Service called Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS). Read more about LUIS [here](https://www.luis.ai/). The LUIS service disambiguates or understands the intent of user input (in this case, the intent is to find information) and the target entity (in this case, the intended entity is an account named Contoso). This information is then passed on to Microsoft’s [Azure bot framework](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/bot-service/), which interacts with data from Dynamics 365 Human Resources and retrieves the desired information for the user query. 

By installing and allowing access to use of the bot, you agree to allow the LUIS service and Azure bot framework to process the intent behind the input,  which results in an enhanced conversational user experience. The LUIS service and Azure bot framework may have varying levels of compliance compared to Dynamics 365 Human Resources. While the LUIS service has access to only the user queries and is not designed to be connected to the user’s Dynamics 365 Human Resources data or account, a user of the Dynamics 365 Human Resources bot could voluntarily enter a query containing Customer Data, Personal Data, or other data and such query content could get sent to the LUIS service and the Azure bot framework. 

The content of user’s queries and messages is retained in LUIS system for a maximum of 30 days, is encrypted at rest, and is not used for training or service improvement. Read more about Cognitive Services [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/). 

To manage admin settings for apps in Microsoft Teams, go to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).

### Microsoft Teams, Azure Event Grid, and Azure Cosmos DB

When using the Dynamics 365 Human Resources app in Microsoft Teams, certain customer data may flow outside of the geographic region where your tenant’s Human Resources service is deployed.

Dynamics 365 Human Resources transmits the employee’s leave request and workflow task details to Microsoft Azure Event Grid and Microsoft Teams. This data may be stored in Microsoft Azure Event Grid for up to 24 hours and will be processed in the United States, is encrypted in transit and at rest, and is not used by Microsoft or its subprocessors for training or service improvements. To understand where your data is stored in Teams, please see: [Location of data in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

While conversing with the chat bot in the Human Resources app, the conversation content may be stored in Azure Cosmos DB and transmitted to Microsoft Teams. This data may be stored in Azure Cosmos DB for up to 24 hours and may be processed outside of the geographic region where your tenant's Human Resources service is deployed, is encrypted in transit and at rest, and is not used by Microsoft or its subprocessors for training or service improvements. To understand where your data is stored in Teams, please see: [Location of data in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).
 
To restrict access to the Human Resources app in Microsoft Teams for your organization or users within your organization, see [Manage app permission policies in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-permission-policies).
