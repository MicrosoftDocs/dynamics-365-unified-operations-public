You can submit a request for a leave of absence and see the status of your leave requests in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

## Request a leave of absence

2. To submit a leave of absence request, select **Request leave of absence**.

3. Enter information for **Leave type**, **Start date**, and **End date**.

4. If you need to submit any supporting documentation, select **Upload** under **Attachments**.

5. Enter information in **Comment**, if needed.

6. Select **Submit** when you're ready to submit your request. Otherwise, select **Save draft**.


## View leave of absence request status

## Importing leave requests from other systems or older systems

To import leave requests from another system, you must go through the regular workflow to create the appropriate leave transactions. Alternatively, you can import the leave bank transactions and the leave requests in a completed state. Note that the leave bank transactions aren't automatically created if you import only the leave requests.
