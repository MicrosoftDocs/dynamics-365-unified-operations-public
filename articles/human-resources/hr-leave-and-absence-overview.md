# Leave and absence overview

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

Dynamics 365 Human Resources helps you provide great leave benefits to your workers. The **Leave and absence** workspace provides a flexible framework for creating new leave plans. It also provides workflows for managing requests and an intuitive self-service page for employees to request time off. Analytics help your organization measure and monitor leave balances and usage for your leave plans.

## Set up Leave and absence

Before creating leave plans for your employees, you need to do a few setup steps:

- [Configure leave and absence parameters](hr-leave-and-absence-parameters.md)
- [Create a working time calendar](hr-leave-and-absence-working-time-calendar.md)
- [Create a leave request workflow](hr-leave-and-absence-workflow.md)
- [Configure the Absence manager role](hr-configure-absence-manager.md)

## Create and manage leave plans

Before creating leave plans for your workers, you need to create leave and absence types. After you create a leave plan, you can then enroll workers into the plan. You can also run the accrue process, create alerts, and view analytics for your plans.

- [Configure leave and absence types](hr-leave-and-absence-types.md)
- [Create a leave and absence plan](hr-leave-and-absence-plans.md)
- [Assign workers to a leave plan](hr-leave-and-absence-enroll.md)
- [Accrue leave and absence plans](hr-leave-and-absence-accrue.md)
- [View analytics for leave and absence](hr-leave-and-absence-analytics.md)

## Request time off and manage requests

Your employees can submit time off requests, and you can manage them, in the **Employee self service** workspace.

- [Request time off](hr-employee-self-service-request-time-off.md)
- [Manage leave and absence requests](hr-employee-self-service-manage-requests.md)
- [Configure absence manager role](hr-configure-absence-manager.md)
