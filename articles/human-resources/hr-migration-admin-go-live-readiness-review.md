# Human Resources migration go-live readiness review

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

This article describes the steps of the go-live readiness review for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources migration to the finance and operations infrastructure.

## Human Resources migration go-live readiness review process

1. Before you request a production environment, complete the [prerequisites for migrating a Human Resources production environment](hr-cust-migration.md#prerequisites-1).
2. Send an email to <d365fogl@microsoft.com>. Use the following subject line: **\<*Customer name*\>: Human Resources migration go-live readiness review**. (Replace **\<*Customer name*\>** with the name of the customer.)

    In the body of the email, provide the following information:

    - Customer name
    - Email addresses and roles of key customer contacts
    - Partner
    - URL of the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services Migration project
    - Go-live date (live transactions)
    - Date when production is requested

    In addition, copy the following list into the email, and provide the appropriate information.

    **Lifecycle Services**

    - Have the analysis, design and develop, and test phases been completed in Lifecycle Services, so that a production environment can be requested?
    - Are you using a generic account as the environment's administrator?
    - Have the customer's key stakeholders been added to the Lifecycle Services project?
    - Confirm that the final version of the subscription estimator was uploaded into the Lifecycle Services project and marked as active.

    **User acceptance testing (UAT)**

    - Has the customer approved and signed off on the migration solution to confirm that it meets their business needs? If not, what's still pending, and what's the timeline for sign-off?
    - Confirm that user training or change management has been completed.

    **Cutover**

    - Do you have a cutover plan that includes the activity duration, responsibilities, dependencies, and a roll-back plan, and has the business signed off on it?
    - Acknowledge the following conditions:

        - Migrations to new environments are on the latest generally available (GA) release. If validation in the sandbox environment was done by using a different version, we recommend that you perform a regression validation by using the release that your production environment uses. For more information about the timeline for each release, see [Public preview release](../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases.md#targeted-release-schedule-dates-subject-to-change).
        - All stand-alone Human Resources environments will automatically be deleted 10 days after the production environment is successfully migrated to the finance and operations infrastructure. This fact is in your rollback strategy.
        - Human Resources migrated environments are put in the same region as the source stand-alone Human Resources environments. If a geo-to-geo migration for Lifecycle Services or environments is required, it will be done after the migrations are completed.

    **Continuous updates**

    - In stand-alone Human Resources, updates are managed by Microsoft on a defined schedule. However, in the finance and operations infrastructure, customers maintain application updates per Microsoft One version policy. Confirm that you understand the continuous update policy for finance and operations apps. For more information, see [One version overview](../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/oneversion-overview.md).

    **Integrations**

    - Are integrations in scope?

        > [!NOTE]
        > If the answer is "Yes," answer the next question in this section. Otherwise, move on to the next section.

    - Have you tested both the happy path and edge cases for each integration, and have you signed off on all integrations that are in scope for go-live? If not, what's still pending, and what's the timeline for sign-off?

    **Dual-write**

    - Does the solution contain any dual-write integrations that are used to run processes across Dynamics 365 applications?

        > [!NOTE]
        > If the answer is "Yes," answer the next question in this section. Otherwise, move on to the next section.

    - Have all dual-write scenarios and flows been tested after migration, and have the acceptance criteria been met at the expected peak load? If not, what's still pending, and what's the timeline for sign-off?

    **Production support and maintenance**

    - Does the project team have a plan in place for regular, monitoring and maintenance of the production environment?
    - Is the project team familiar with the environment monitoring and diagnostics tool in Lifecycle Services?
    - Has the project team defined a process for post-go-live issue resolution and escalation?

3. The Dynamics 365 finance and operations go-live team replies to your email within two business days. A FastTrack team then works with you to assess the project's readiness for production deployment. The team also shares the potential risks, best practices, and recommendations for a successful go-live of the project.
4. After all critical risks have been addressed, and the review has been completed, Microsoft enables the production environment in the Lifecycle Services project. The customer/partner can then deploy the production environment.
