# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Human Resources (February 25, 2020)

This article describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Changes apply to build number 8.1.2927. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to LCS support numbers for reference.

## Enable Case Management navigation and data management framework (DMF) entity (414754)

This preview feature enables additional navigation to case management cases. You can enable this preview feature in the **Feature Management** workspace. These menu items appear in the **Compliance** workspace of Dynamics 365 Human Resources. With this change, Human Resources can access:

- All cases
- My cases
- My open cases
- My overdue cases
- Cases assigned to me through workflow

Along with these new views into cases, the **Case detail** DMF entity is also available.

## Enable Relationship definitions in global address bBook (414762)

Relationships are now enabled in the global address book. Prior to this week's release, the **Relationship** fact box displayed any system-defined relationships. Now you can define those relationships within the global address book page.

## A position can be removed when active compensation records exist for the position (414568)

With this change, a warning appears when you attempt to delete a position and a worker has an active compensation record for that same position. When this happens, you must update the employee fixed compensation record before removing the position.

## Performance review workflow occasionally adds sign-offs from people who are not part of the process (414171)

This change corrects an issue where additional sign-off participants are added to the performance review.

## Worker position assignment not created in Common Data Service when selected on the New Worker dialog (413479)

This change corrects an issue when hiring a new worker and assigning the new hire to a position through the **New worker** dialog. Now the position assignment is reflected in Common Data Service.

## Coming soon
