# Create a leave request workflow

You can create a workflow in Dynamics 365 Human Resources to consistently manage your leave and absence requests. A **Leave and absence** workflow lets you:

- Define tasks
- Determine who must complete the tasks
- Specify who can approve or reject requests

## Create a Leave and absence request workflow

1. On the **Leave and absence** page, select the **Links** tab.

2. Under **Setup**, select **Human resource workflows**.

3. Select **New**, and then select **Leave and absence request**. 

4. When the **Open this file?** message box appears, select **Open** and sign in with your company credentials.

5. Use the workflow editor to create a workflow for your leave requests. For more information about working with workflows, see [Create workflows overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/create-workflow?toc=/dynamics365/commerce/toc.json.)
