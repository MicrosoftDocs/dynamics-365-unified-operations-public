| 611339 | Adding a personalization causes the bank account to ignore filter and fetches the first record | Adding a personalization causes the bank account list to run a personalization query after the datasource query runs, resulting in the query fetching the top record regardless of the worker for whom the details are being viewed. |
| 591806 | Onboarding due date tasks are incorrectly calculated | Due dates are incorrectly calculated when the following conditions exist:  The checklists that are created are using a calendar that uses an extended time range (example from 2005 to 2050) and the user's preferences utilize a time zone other than Central Standard Time. |   
| 592749 | Leave balance is incorrect on **Employee self service** | If the employee has employment in more than one legal entity and cross company leave view is enabled, the leave balance might be incorrect. |
| 603133 | Unexpected warning when requesting time off | When requesting time off, filling the **Half-day** field before the **Amount** field will cause an unexpected warning. |
| 606546 | Select field not visible in Approved time off | The check box to select multiple approved leave requests was not visible. |
