| Issue number | Issue | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 469495 | Update default financial dimensions grid and dialog box | The financial dimensions grid and dialog box is updated throughout Human Resources. |
| 474887 | Leave request work item opens wrong link in a manual decision | When a workflow configuration contains a manual decision, navigating to the leave request from **Work items assigned to me** opens the wrong link, showing either a blank form or a leave request created by the current user instead of the one assigned to them for the manual decision. |
| 474962 | Leave and absence parameters entity has fields with ambiguous labels | Leave and absence parameters entity labels are updated to be clearer. |
| 481401 | Accrual processing hangs when accrual date basis is after accrual start date and at end of month | Accrual processing is updated to not have a delay when the accrual date basis is after the accrual start date and at the end of the month. |
| 447167 | Expiring records lists include inactive workers | The **Expiring records** tab in **Personnel management** included inactive workers. Now it only includes active workers. |
| 486840 | Wrong leave of absence request opens from **Work items assigned to me** | Selecting a leave of absence request from **Work items assigned to me** no longer opens the most recent leave of absence request assigned to the current user. |
| 506868 | Common Data Service **Title** field not set for **Job position** entity | The **Title** field in the **Job** and **Job position** entities displayed as not specified. The **Title** field now displays. |
| 430359 | Can't access offboarding checklist tasks with manager and employee roles assigned | Workers with a future termination date couldn't access their checklist tasks if they only had an employee or manager role.
