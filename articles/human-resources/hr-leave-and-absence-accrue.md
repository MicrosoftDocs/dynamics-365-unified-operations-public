2. Under **Manage leave**, select **Delete leave and absence plan accruals**.

## Review leave accrual and deletion processes

**Leave accrual audit** displays each time you run or delete an accrual for one or all employees. The date and person who performed the action also displays.

1. On the **Leave and absence** page, select the **Links** tab.
2. Under **Manage leave**, select **Delete leave accrual audit**.

## Leave accrual rounding
When an employee is either enrolled or unenrolled, leave accrual rounding will be prorated. Previously, rounding was only allowed when a leave plan was set to prorate, and an employee was enrolled/unenrolled during mid-period. Leave accruals will now round regardless of enrollment/unenrollment at mid-period or at the start of a period.

## Leave accrual transaction auditing

This feature helps leave and absence managers understand the leave and absence accrual transactions related to an employee’s time off balances for a specific leave type.

To view transaction details:

1. On the employee's record, select **Leave**.

2. Select **View time off**, and then select the **Balances** tab.

To view the accrual transactions related to a specific leave type, select the numerical value in the **Current balance** column.

To view the transaction details for a specific accrual amount, select an accrual row, open the **Related information** panel on the right, and then open the **Transaction details** section. The Transaction details section displays:

- Changes to the employee’s leave type balance
- Employment details for that specified accrual period
- Details about the accrual period and rates
- Any changes made to leave plan configurations
