You can submit requests for time off, view your vacation and leave balances, and see the status of your leave requests in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

## Request time off

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **Request time off** in the **Time Off Balances** tile.

2. Enter information for **Leave type**, **Reason code**, **Start date**, and **End date**.

3. Under **Dates**, select the dates for your leave request.

4. If you need to submit any supporting documentation, select **Upload** under **Attachments**.

5. Enter information in **Comment**, if needed.

6. Select **Submit** when you're ready to submit your request. Otherwise, select **Save draft**.

Employees who submit a new leave request can select different leave types to construct their leave request. However, all leave types that are selected as part of a single leave request should have the same leave unit. Employees can view the leave unit for each leave type on the **Request time off** page.

## Add an attachment to an existing request

When updating an existing time off request, you can add an attachment. You can also see all the related requests for a specific date.

2. Select **Balances**.

## View leave request status

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **More** (...) in the **Time Off Balances** tile.
