# Employee and Manager self service overview

This article provides an overview of the employee and manager self service workspace.

## Edit personal details

If you need to add or change any personal information, see [Edit personal information](hr-employee-manager-self-service-edit-personal-information.md).

## User not assigned to a worker record

If you haven't linked your user to a **Worker** record in the **Users** page, the following message will display:

**Your user ID is not associated with your employee record in the system. You won't be able to view or update your information until it is. Contact your manager or support team for assistance.**

To associate a user with a **Worker** record, navigate to **Users** and select the user. Select **Edit**, add the corresponding worker in the **Person** field on the form, and the select **Save**. You should now have access to Employee self service.

## Security requirements for Employee and Manager self service

Employee and Manager self service require two security roles:

- Employees require the Employee role.
- Managers require both the Employee and Manager roles.

>[!NOTE]
>You can also use custom roles to access Employee and Manager self service as long as they've been granted access to Employee and Manager workspaces.<br>
>Manager access to employee information is based on the current position line hierarchy defined in Human Resources.

## Employee self service

The **My information** tab displays the following information for Employee self service.  

### Summary

**Work items assigned to me** displays all approvals and workflow items that are assigned to the employee. You can configure workflow items to send emails to the user.

**Questionnaires assigned to me** display all scheduled questionnaires assigned directly to the employee or group.

**Company directory** lets employees look up information related to individuals in the organization. Public contact information is available to all employees. The company directory is restricted to the company that the employee has signed into.

**Team calendar** shows your team's calendar information. For more information, see [View team and company calendars](hr-employee-self-service-calendar.md).

### My career information

The **My career information** section of Employee self-service contains cards related to Leave and Absence, Performance Management, Competencies, Benefits, Tasks, and Attachments.

The **Time Off Balances** card displays the balances for any enrolled plans. This card forecasts your balance based on your accrual method. You can enter and submit time-off requests, which will then go through an approval workflow process. For more information about Leave and absence, see [Leave and absence overview](hr-leave-and-absence-overview.md).

The **Tasks** card displays tasks that are assigned to you and lets you view and manage them.

The **Next Registered Course** card displays the next course you're registered for. You can view and register for any open courses. All courses that are open for sign-up have a status of **Started**, and allow employees to self-register appear on this card. Depending on your organization's settings, your course registration might go through an approval process.

The **Certificates** card displays the certificate and expiration date of the certificate expiring closest to the current date. You can update, add, or remove certificates. Depending on your organization's settings, certificate updates might go through an approval process.

The **Next Scheduled Review** card displays your next performance review. You can start a new review from this card. Your manager or HR representative can also initiate reviews. Depending on your organization's settings, you might also be able to view, update, and submit exit reviews from this card.

You can manage your goals with the **Performance Goals** card. This card displays the number of goals you have in each status (**Not started**, **On track**, and **Needs improvement**). You can create, update, and remove goals, depending on your assigned role-based security. If you want, you can add new goals from groups or templates. Managers and HR can also create goals on behalf of employees and determine how detailed each goal will be. Managers and employees can collaborate on goals and update activities, measurements, and status. You can also include attachments.

You can view your existing skills on the **Skills** card. You can update skills, add new ones, or remove any that are no longer relevant. Depending on your organization's settings, changes to your skills might go through an approval process.

You can view your current compensation through the **Compensation** card. Select **Show** to view your annual pay and last increase amount. If you're employed in more than one company, each annual amount displays on the card. To view your detailed compensation history, select the annual salary amount to open the **Fixed and variable compensation history** form. Future compensation doesn't display in this form. If you have more than one employment, you can switch between companies within this form to view your compensation history without logging into each company.

View and manage documents with the **Attachments** card. You can manage all **External** attachments. Both HR and employees can add attachments through Employee self service or the **Worker** form. Attachments are set to **External** by default.

The author of the questionnaire can determine the time frame and for whom the questionnaire is applicable.

You can configure user-defined links in **Human Resources parameters**. For example, you can define links to pay statements, year-end documentation, or external solutions. These links display at the bottom of this section, but you can move them by using personalization.

You can also create additional tabs by embedding Power Apps within the Employee self service workspace. Use the **Settings** menu to personalize the page with any Power Apps.

The last increase amount and percentage displays, based on the company of employment.
