# Employee self service overview


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

This article provides an overview of the Employee self service workspace.

Employee self service is the perfect gateway for employees to view essential company information. The Employee self service workspace bridges the gap between employees and HR, allowing employees the freedom to access and manage their data, time-off, benefits, payroll, learning, and much more. Having a one-stop shop for employees saves time for both employees and HR. 

My information is separated into three sections: Summary, My career information, Additional information.  

### Summary 
The Summary section is comprised of tiles to show the employee priority items such as work items assigned to me, Questionnaires assigned to me, Company directory, Team absence calendar.  

**Work items assigned to me** displays all approvals and workflow items that are assigned to the employee. You can configure workflow items to send emails to the user.

**Questionnaires assigned to me** display all scheduled questionnaires assigned directly to the employee or group.

**Company directory** lets employees look up information related to individuals in the organization. Public contact information is available to all employees. The company directory is restricted to the company that the employee has signed into.

**Team calendar** shows your team's calendar information. For more information, see [View team and company calendars](hr-employee-self-service-calendar.md).

### My career information

The **My career information** section of **Employee self service** displays tiles related to Leave and Absence, Performance Management, Competencies, Benefits, Tasks, and Attachments.

The **Time Off Balances** tile displays the balances for any enrolled plans. This tile forecasts your balance based on your accrual method. You can enter and submit time off requests, which will then go through an approval workflow process. For more information about Leave and absence, see [Leave and absence overview](hr-leave-and-absence-overview.md).

The **Tasks** tile displays tasks that are assigned to you and lets you view and manage them.

The **Next registered course** tile displays the next course that you're registered for. You can view and register for any open courses. If a course has a status of **Open** and is marked for employee self-registration, employees can easily self-register for it when they drill into **View open courses**.

> [!NOTE] 
> If the **Course enhancements** feature is enabled, an employee's view shows a **Courses** card that includes courses that are overdue, courses that are due soon (within 10 days), and courses that are assigned. Employee can drill into assigned, open, and completed courses by selecting **View courses** on the **Courses** tile in **Employee self service**. For virtual courses only, employees can change the status to **Complete**.

Depending on your organization's settings, your course registration might go through an approval process.

The **Certificates** tile displays the certificate and expiration date of the certificate expiring closest to the current date. You can update, add, or remove certificates. Depending on your organization's settings, certificate updates might go through an approval process.

The **Next Scheduled Review** displays your next performance review. You can start a new review from this tile. Your manager or HR representative can also initiate reviews. Depending on your organization's settings, you might also be able to view, update, and submit exit reviews.

You can manage your goals with **Performance Goals**. This tile displays the number of goals you have in each status (**Not started**, **On track**, and **Needs improvement**). You can create, update, and remove goals, depending on your assigned role-based security. If you want, you can add new goals from groups or templates. Managers and HR can also create goals on behalf of employees and determine how detailed each goal will be. Managers and employees can collaborate on goals and update activities, measurements, and status. You can also include attachments.

You can view your existing skills on the **Total Skills** tile. You can update skills, add new ones, or remove any that are no longer relevant. Depending on your organization's settings, changes to your skills might go through an approval process.

You can view your current compensation on **Compensation**. Select **Show** to view your annual pay and last increase amount. If you're employed in more than one company, each annual amount is displayed. To view your detailed compensation history, select the **Annual salary** amount to open the **Fixed and variable compensation history** page. Future compensation doesn't display in this page. If you have more than one employment, you can switch between companies within this page to view your compensation history without logging into each company.

View and manage documents with the **Attachments** tile. You can manage all **External** attachments. Both HR and employees can add attachments through **Employee self service** or the **Worker** page. Attachments are set to **External** by default.

### Additional information

This section provides links to other **Employee self service** areas, similar to the **My Career Information** section.

Sign up for benefits through the **Benefits** link. For more information about Benefits management, see [Benefits overview](hr-benefits-management-overview.md).

Under **Performance**, you can select **Performance journal** to create performance journal entries to use on both performance goals and reviews. You can select **Send feedback** to provide feedback for other employees within your organization. Depending on your organization's settings, emails might be sent to the recipient, sender, and managers. You can send feedback to all employees within the organization. Sending feedback isn't restricted by company.

Under **Competencies**, you can make changes to **Courses**, **Education**, **Positions of trust**, and **Professional experience**. Depending on your organization's settings, updates to these competencies might go through an approval process.

You can view job details under **Organization**. Job details include skills, certificates, and areas of responsibility for your primary position. You can also see any loaned equipment checked out to you. Depending on your organization's settings, changes to loaned equipment might go through an approval process.
