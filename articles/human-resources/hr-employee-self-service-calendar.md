# View team and company calendars

[!include [banner](includes/preview-feature.md)]

You can view team and company calendars in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Team calendars only display direct reports, as defined in the line hierarchy.

## View your team calendar as an employee

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **My team**.

2. Select **Leave and absence**, and then select **View team calendar**.


## View your team calendar as a manager

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **My team**.

2. Select **Leave and absence**, and then select **View team calendar**.

Managers can also access the team calendar from **Pending time off requests from my team**, **Aproved time off** and **Time off requests**. 

## View a company calendar

People who are in Human resources roles can view company calendars. Company calendars display all employees. By default, the calendar displays today's date plus 28 days, but you can change the date range. You can also filter the calendar by **Name**, **Personnel number**, and **Leave type**.

1. In the **Leave and absence** workspace, select **Links**.

2. Select **Leave and absence calendar**.

Human resources roles can also access the company calendar from **Leave and absence requests**, **Aproved time off** and **Time off requests**. 

For information about calendar settings, see [Configure calendar parameters](hr-leave-and-absence-parameters.md?configure-calendar-parameters)
