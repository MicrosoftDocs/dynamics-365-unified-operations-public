# Create custom links in Manager self-service

You can add custom links on the **My team** tab in Manager self-service. This feature lets you provide quick access to important information. It's similar to adding custom links in the **My information** tab in Employee self service.

## Enable the  feature

To use this feature, enable **Custom links in Manager self-service** in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information about enabling preview features, see [Manage features](hr-admin-manage-features.md).

## Set up custom links

1. In **Human Resources parameters**, select **Manager self service**.

2. Under **Set up links for Managers**, you can add, edit, or remove a link. You can also group the links together so they display in a group in Manager self-service.

3. To see the links, go to the **My team** tab in Employee self-service.
