# Create custom links in Manager self service


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

You can add custom links on the **My team** tab in **Manager self service**. This feature lets you provide quick access to important information. It's similar to adding custom links in the **My information** tab in **Employee self service**.

## Enable the feature

To use this feature, enable **Custom links in Manager self service** in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information about enabling preview features, see [Manage features](hr-admin-manage-features.md).

## Set up custom links

1. In **Human Resources parameters**, select **Manager self service**.

2. Under **Set up links for Managers**, you can add, edit, or remove a link. You can also group the links together so they display in a group in **Manager self service**.
