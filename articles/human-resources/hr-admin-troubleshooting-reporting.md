**Environment details**

This issue applies to all environments.

**Symptom**

The customer wants to customize Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources reports or create new reports.

**Issue**

The user can't customize the embedded Microsoft Power BI reports.

**Solution**

- The Human Resources data that flows to Dataverse can be reported on via the Power Apps Dataverse connector to Power BI Desktop. Note that Dataverse contains a subset of Human Resources data. For more information about Power BI and dashboards, see [Create Power BI reports and dashboards with Power Apps Common Data Service](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/cdsconnectortopowerbi).
- Electronic reporting (ER) is available for some reports in Human Resources. Customer-driven customizations can be done via the ER configuration options.
- Data can be exported to Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word by using the various data entities that Human Resources provides through the Microsoft Office integration.

**Long-term solution**

Additional Power BI options will be available, and more data and entities will be part of Dataverse.
