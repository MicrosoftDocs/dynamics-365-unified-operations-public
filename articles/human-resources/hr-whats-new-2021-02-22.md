Instead, it processes for all legal entities and closes and reopens the plans in the selected legal entity.

## Terminology updates for Microsoft Dataverse

Effective November 2020, Common Data Service has been renamed to [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro). See the [official announcement](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/reshape-the-future-of-work-with-microsoft-dataverse-for-teams-now-generally-available/) on the Power Apps blog to learn more. With this name change, some terminology in Dataverse has been updated. For example, *entity* is now *table* and *field* is now *column*. For more information, see [Terminology updates](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates).

In this release, terminology related to the Dynamics 365 Human Resources integration with Dataverse has been updated throughout the application to reflect these changes. For example, the **Common Data Service integration** form is now **Microsoft Dataverse integration**.

To learn more about the Dynamics 365 Human Resources integration with Microsoft Dataverse, see [Configure Microsoft Dataverse integration](./hr-admin-integration-common-data-service.md) and [Configure Microsoft Dataverse virtual tables](./hr-admin-integration-common-data-service-virtual-entities.md).

## Updates to service deployment

Beginning with the February 22, 2021 release, we're adjusting our regional service update deployment. The adjustments will include rotating the order in which global regions receive updates for the Human Resources service, and modifications in the wait time between update stages. These changes bring us more in line with Safe Deployment Practices (SDP) to improve service stability, quality, and supportability.

We'll continue to follow the two-week deployment cadence. However, customers may notice that updates are typically applied to their Human Resources environments on a different day of the two-week cycle than in previous releases.

For more information about the service update process, see [Update process](./hr-admin-setup-update-process.md).
