# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Human Resources (September 3, 2020)

[!include [rename-banner](~/includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Changes apply to build number 8.1.3504. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to Lifecycle Services (LCS) support numbers for reference.

For more information about upcoming features in Human Resources, see [Overview of Dynamics 365 Human Resources 2019 release wave 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-human-resources/). For more information about the update process for Human Resources, see [Update process](hr-admin-setup-update-process.md).

## In this release

### New default financial dimensions grid and dialog pattern throughout Human Resources (469495)

The new pattern for financial dimensions is now available in the following areas:

- Position actions  (Form: **HcmPositionActionDetail**)
- Payroll earning codes  (Form: **PayrollEarningCode**)

### Entries don't appear in company leave calendar if Leave and absence calendar enhancements aren't enabled (484406)

This release corrects an issue where leave entries aren't displayed in the company leave calendar. This issue only occurs when the Feature management option **Leave and absence calendar enhancements** isn't enabled.

### BenefitPlanEmployeeEntity issue (467597)

This release corrects an issue with the **BenefitsPlanEmployee** entity. When importing worker enrollments, the **Coverage code** and the **Plan type code** are now set correctly. This issue caused employee benefit plans to display incorrectly in the **Worker benefits plan** and **Open enrollment** forms in Employee self service.

### Electronic file 1094-C output missing letter in XML (435190)

This change corrects an issue with the 1094-C output file missing a character needed when submitting to the IRS.

### Employee variable compensation table mapped to fixed compensation form (476117)

This change aligns the fixed compensation fields with the fixed compensation form. Variable compensation fields are now only available with the variable compensation form.

### Leave requests allowed before enrollment if that leave type has a negative minimum balance (469917)

This change prohibits entering leave requests before being enrolled in the plan, even if the enrollment has a negative minimum balance. You can only enter or submit requests when the plan is active.

### Document templates don't download (457279)

With this change, you can now download all document templates. 

### Data displays as column headers instead of rows for the Pay rate field in the compensation plan report (476077)

The analytics report now displays the correct information for **Pay rate**.

## Coming Soon

### Checklist entities included in Common Data Service

Checklist entities for Onboarding, Offboarding, Transfers, and Business processes will be available soon in Common Data Service.

### Benefits management reason codes

Benefits management reason codes will soon be combined with existing reason codes in Human Resources. If you created reason codes in Benefits management that are over 15 characters, you must change the name of the reason code in the Benefits management **Reason codes** form to be 15 characters or less. After you update the name, the reason code will appear under the existing reason code form in Personnel management. This change will be available in the future and won't affect existing functionally.
