# HR Recruiting app known issues 

This article describes the known issues in the HR Recruiting app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources.


## Known issues and limitations 

The following is a list of known issues and limitations for the HR Recruiting app:
  - Education details from a recruiting request doesn't populate job ads if the education level isn't set in the recruiting request in Dynamics 365 finance and operations environment.
  - In the email template, the category is always set to **User**.
  - On the **Candidate** page, documents up to 32MB can be uploaded. Each individual file can't exceed 5MB.
  - For bulk resume uploads generated by AI, each file mustn't exceed 2MB.
  - If an error occurs on the **Job description** page due to AI, saving the copilot configuration may resolve the issue.
  - If a meeting invitation is sent manually instead of using the interview scheduling feature, a feedback notification isn't sent to the interviewer.
  - A feedback notification is sent when the meeting begins on the scheduled date.
  - Candidate education details missing an area of study aren't synced to the Dynamics 365 finance and operations version when the applicant moves to the **Ready to hire** state.
  - When a recruiting request is published, a job ad is automatically created in **Draft** status. The **Estimated start date** field uses the time zone of the administrator account executing the flow. Users in earlier time zones than the administrator may see the start date as a past date and can update this value manually.
  - Hiring managers can view the **Bulk resume upload** option, but usage is restricted to recruiters.
  - An error may occur when viewing the **Template steps** tab in a **Hiring template - related tab**.
