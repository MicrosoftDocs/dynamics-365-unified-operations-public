# Dynamics 365 Human Resources recruitment

[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-1.md)]

In human resources management, recruitment is the process of finding and hiring the best and most qualified candidate for a job opening. It can also be defined as the 
process for searching for prospective employees. 

In Dynamics 365 Human Resources (merged infrastructure), there are two recruiting experiences: **Recruitment projects** and **HR Recruitment**. The default setting 
is **Recruitment projects** until **HR Recruitment** is enabled through feature management and HR parameters.  

Recruitment projects organize the steps to complete when filling open positions in a legal entity. An applicant is a person who applies for 
employment to your enterprise. An application is an applicant's expression of interest in being employed by a company and may be tied to a recruitment project. 
A single applicant may have multiple applications within the same legal entity or across multiple companies in an organization. 

HR Recruitment helps manage recruiting requests. It also helps to transition job candidates to employees. If your organization uses a separate 
recruiting application, your recruiting process might include the following steps: 

1. Enter your recruiting request in Human Resources. 
2. Receive candidate referrals in Human Resources from the recruiting application. 
3. Complete the candidate approval process in Human Resources. 

If you aren't using a separate recruiting application, you can manually manage candidates in Human Resources. 

> [!Important] 
> Dynamics 365 Human Resources (stand-alone) helps you to manage recruiting requests. It also helps you seamlessly transition job candidates to employees.
