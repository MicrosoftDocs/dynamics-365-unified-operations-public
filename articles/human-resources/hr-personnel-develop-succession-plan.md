As your organization grows, you must begin succession planning. During succession planning, you might want to find someone who has similar skills to another person. Skill mapping allows you to analyze your existing employees and applicants to see if they match the skill set of a valued employee. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.

1. Go to **Human resources > Competencies > Skill analysis > Skill mapping profiles**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Skill mapping** field, enter a name for your skill mapping. Example: Employee.
4. In the **Description** field, type a value.
5. In the **Date** field, enter a date.
6. Select **Retrieve profile**.
7. Select **Person**.
8. In the **Person** field, type in a name, or select the drop-down.
9. Select **OK**.
10. Expand the **Certificates** FastTab to view or edit the certificates included in the skill mapping.
11. Expand the **Skills** FastTab to view or edit the skills to be included.
12. In the list, mark the first row. Example:  Accounting.
13. Select the **Optional** checkbox.
14. In the **Importance** field, select an option. When you mark a skill as optional, you must select the importance level of the skill.  
15. In the list, select row 2.
16. Select the **Optional** checkbox.
17. In the **Importance** field, select an option.
18. In the list, select row 3.
19. Select the **Optional** checkbox.
20. In the **Importance** field, select an option.
21. In the list, select row 4.
22. Select the **Optional** checkbox.
23. In the **Importance** field, select an option.
24. Expand the **Education** FastTab to view or edit the education competencies to be included in the skill mapping.
25. Select **Execute**.
26. Select **OK**.
27. Select **Result**.
28. Select **Report**. The report lists the best matches at the top of the report. You can see a gap element listed. A gap is the difference between the skill-mapping level and the person's skill level.
