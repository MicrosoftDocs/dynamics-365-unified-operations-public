# Get support

This article explains how to get help with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

To get support for Human Resources, use the resources in the following table. These resources are listed in the order that we recommend that you follow when you troubleshoot.

| Task | More information |
|------|------------------|
| Ask the community. | Go to the [Dynamics 365 Human Resources Community](https://community.dynamics.com/365/talent) to get help with your questions. To find answers, enter a question in the search field next to **Have a question**. To ask a question, select **Ask a question**. |
| Use the cloud-powered support tool. | In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/), go to your project, and select the **Support** tile. From there, you can submit issues two ways:<ul><li>On the **Active issues** tab, select the issue that you want to submit, and then select **Submit to Microsoft**.</li><li>On the **Submitted to Microsoft** tab, select **Submit a new Incident** to submit a new issue.</li></ul> |
| Get in-app support. | Select the **Help** button (**?**) in the upper-right corner of the page. Select **Support**. Issues are reported on the **Active issues** tab in LCS, where an admin can determine whether to provide in-house support or submit the issues to Microsoft. |
| Get help with questions about Human Resources licensing. | Contact your partner or Microsoft sales representative. |
| Request new features and functionality in Human Resources. | In Human Resources, select the **Help** button (**?**), and then select **Ideas**. You can also visit [Dynamics 365 Application Ideas](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/) to view, search, or vote for existing ideas, or to add new ideas. |
