# Benefits management workspace

[!include [applies to](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

[!include [preview feature](./includes/preview-feature.md)]

This topic describes the **Benefits management** workspace in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Benefits management** workspace, you must first enable the **(Preview) Benefits management workspace** feature in Feature management. For more information about enabling preview features, see [Manage features](../hr-admin-manage-features.md).<br><br>![Enable Benefits management workspace](./media/hr-benefits-management-workspace-enable.png)

The **Benefits management** workspace gives you a quick view of benefits items that require your attention. On this page, you can see:

- Totals for items awaiting action
- Workers with unconfirmed selections
- Workers who recently enrolled in benefits
- Workers with future life events
- New hires who aren't enrolled
- Workers with active life events
- Workers with open enrollments who haven't opted for any plans

## View action items

You can view your action items by either selecting a tile or a tab. If you select a tab, you can view and select workers right on the workspace page.

![Action items](./media/hr-benefits-management-workspace-action-items.png)

If you select a tile, you go to the page for that area. For example, selecting any of these tiles displays the **Worker benefits plans** page, filtered for employees you need to take action on:

- **Unconfirmed selections**
- **Open enrollments with no checked out plans**
- **Enrolled in benefits**
- **New hire not enrolled**

Selecting the **Active life events** or **Future life events** tiles takes you to a list of active or future life events.
