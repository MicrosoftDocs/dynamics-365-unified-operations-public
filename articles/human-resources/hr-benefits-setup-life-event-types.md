# Configure life event types


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

Dynamics 365 Human Resources uses **Life event types** to define events where it is valid to update employee benefits enrollment, such as getting married or having a child. Each life event type ID may only be associated with one life event type. For example, if you create a **Life event ID** called **Address change** that is associated with the life event type **Employee address change**, you can’t create another ID labeled **Employee address change** and associate it with the life event type **Employee address change**. If a life event type isn't associated with a plan type, the life event type won't trigger a life event. For more information, see [Create plan types](hr-benefits-setup-plan-types.md).

## Create a life event type

1. In the **Benefits management** workspace, under **Setup**, select **Life event types**.

2. Select **New**.

3. Specify values for the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Life event type ID** | The life event type unique identifier. |
   | **Description** | A description of the life event type. |
   | **Life event type** | A catalyst to updating an employee’s benefits enrollment. For a list of life events, see [Life events](hr-benefits-setup-payment-frequencies.md?life-events) below. |

4. Select **Save**.

## View attached plans

You can see a list of plans that are attached to the selected **Life event type**. Life events are attached to a plan type, and plan types are associated with a plan.

1. In the **Benefits management** workspace, under **Setup**, select **Life event types**.

2. Select **Actions**.

3. Select **Attached plans**.

## Life events

You can choose from the following life events when you create a life event type:
