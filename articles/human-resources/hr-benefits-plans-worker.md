# Create worker benefit plans

You can create worker benefit plans in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources to select benefit plans for employees and to confirm benefit plan selections. Typically, employees select benefit plans themselves by using Employee self service, and then a benefits administrator confirms the selections. 

1. In the **Benefits management** workspace, under **Plans**, select **Worker benefit plans**.

2. Select **New**.

3. Specify values for the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Period | Specifies a benefits period to use to filter the plans in the Plans fast tab. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. For example, select a period you created called 2015 to confirm all the benefit enrollment selections for 2015. |
   | Worker | Specifies a worker to use to filter the plans in the Plans fast tab. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. |
   | Legal entity | Specifies a legal entity to use to filter the plans in the Plans fast tab. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. |
   | Coverage option | Specifies a coverage option to use to filter the plans in the Plans fast tab. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. |
   | Default | Filters the benefit plans based on whether they are a default plan. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. |
   | Status | Filters benefit plans based on their status. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. |
   | Confirmation | Specifies the confirmation status to use to filter the plans in the Plans fast tab. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. |
   | Cancellation | Specifies the cancellation status to use to filter the plans in the Plans fast tab. Filter the plans to help you select a subset of all the plan records so that you can confirm the subset. |
   | Effective date filter | Filters the plans based on whether theyâ€™re expired, active, or will be active in the future. Select the check boxes that correspond to the plans you want to see in the Plans fast tab. |
   | Plans | The Plans fast tab contains the plans that meet the filter criteria you specified. The relevant configuration options that were set by HR staff and the enrollment selections that were chosen by employees are included on each line. The Qualified field specifies whether there is a validation conflict with the plan selection. |

4. Select **Save**.
