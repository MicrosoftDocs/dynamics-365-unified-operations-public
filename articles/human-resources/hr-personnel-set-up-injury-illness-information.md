Employers have to know when their employees suffer injuries or illness because of hazards in the workplace. You can use the **Injury and illness** page to set up information that facilitates reporting of work-place injuries or illnesses. You can set up types of injuries and illnesses, including types of treatments, costs, and outcomes. The **USMF** demo data company was used to create this procedure.

1. Go to **Human resources** \> **Workers** \> **Injury and illness** \> **Injury and illness setup**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Injury or illness type** field, enter a value (for example, **Fracture**).
4. In the **Description** field, enter a value (for example, **Bone fracture**).
5. Select the **Body parts** tab.
6. Select **New**.
7. In the **Body part** field, enter a value (for example, **Wrist**).
8. In the **Description** field, enter a value (for example, **Wrist**).
9. Select the **Treatment types** tab.
10. Select **New**.
11. In the **Treatment type** field, enter a value (for example, **Splint**).
12. In the **Description** field, enter a value (for example, **Put a splint on**).
13. Select the **Cost types** tab.
14. Select **New**.
15. In the **Cost type** field, enter a value (for example, **X-rays**).
16. In the **Description** field, enter a value (for example, **X-rays**).
17. Select the **Outcome types** tab.
18. Select **New**.
19. In the **Outcome type** field, enter a value (for example, **Therapy**).
20. In the **Description** field, enter a value (for example, **Physical therapy**).
21. Select the **Severity levels** tab.

    Customizable severity levels can be created. For example, severity 1 might indicate a minor injury, whereas severity 3 might indicate a severe injury.

22. Select the **Reporting agencies** tab.

    Reporting agencies are the agencies that the incident must be reported to. Select the **Default** checkbox for the agency that is the default agency that injuries and illnesses must be reported to.

23. Select **Save**.
