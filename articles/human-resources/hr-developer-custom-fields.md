# Custom fields



[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]



You can add custom fields to pages in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. For more information about creating custom fields, see [Create and work with custom fields](/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/user-defined-fields).

Most Dataverse tables support custom fields. For a full list of Dataverse tables, see [Dataverse tables](./hr-developer-entities.md). 

Be sure to enable any custom fields that you create so you can use them in Dataverse. For more information, see [Exposing custom fields on data entities](/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/user-defined-fields#exposing-custom-fields-on-data-entities).
