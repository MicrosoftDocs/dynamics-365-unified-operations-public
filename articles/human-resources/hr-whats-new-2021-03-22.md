| Issue number | Issue |  Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 554239 | Performance improvements for entities related to the **BusinessProcessTaskAssignment** table | Improve performance of entities related to the **BusinessProcessTaskAssignment** table by adding suggested indexes to the table. |
| 566061 | Remove V2 entity fallback code from nightly sync | Remove V2 fallback code for nightly Dataverse sync. The fallback is no longer necessary and prevents filtered sync from working as expected. The change enhances consistency of the Dataverse data sync. |
| 538024 | Worker benefit plans > Remove checkout throwing error | Fixed error while removing checkout for Benefit plan option in Worker benefits form. |
| 557965 | **Benefits** workspace: **Active life events** link should always be visible in **Links** section | Fixed issue where **Active life events** link was visible in **Links** section, but was throwing an error while trying to navigate if the **(Preview) Benefits management workspace** feature isn't enabled. For more information about enabling the workspace, see [Benefits management workspace](hr-benefits-management-workspace.md). |
| 556672 | Unable to process accruals for a terminated employee when **Streamlined employee entry** is enabled in Feature management | The option to accrue leave and absence plans has been added to **More options** under **Work history** for employees when **Streamlined employee entry** is enabled in Feature management. |
| 562656 | **SysRecordChangeLogValidTimeState** menu item should be included in a security privilege and an extension of the **SystemExternalBasicMaintain** security duty | Non-system admin roles were missing the **View changes** button on the date manager forms. |
| 505989 | Life events processing: Change of eligibility not processed correctly due to date used | Fixed issue where change in eligibility processing was dependent on the position start date and not just the current position. |
| 562286 | Terminate worker sends multiple updates to Dataverse | When a worker is terminated, more than one update operation is sent to Dataverse, resulting in two update notifications for the same change. This can cause multiple triggers if a Power Automate flow is configured to trigger from the action. |
| 527340 | "Unrepresentable DateTime" error displays when opening leave and absence enrollments | When selecting a leave and absence enrollment, the error no longer displays. |
| 561663 | Increase wait time interval for cluster provisioning | Improve infrastructure stability and provisioning consistency with updates to cluster provisioning. |
