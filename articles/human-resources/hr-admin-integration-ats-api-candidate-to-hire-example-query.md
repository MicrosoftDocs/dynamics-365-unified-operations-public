# Example query for Candidate to hire

This topic provides an example query for the Candidate to hire entity in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

This topic provides an example demonstrating how you can use *deep inserts* to create all the detail of a new candidate record in a single API operation. For more information about deep inserts, see [Create related entity records in one operation](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/create-entity-web-api#create-related-entity-records-in-one-operation).

The **mshr_hcmcandidatetohireentity** entity is unique because of its relationship to the **mshr_dirpersonentity** entity. Many of the properties on the **mshr_hcmcandidatetohireentity** (for example, **mshr_firstname**, **mshr_lastname**, and **mshr_birthdate**) are derived from the **mshr_dirpersonentity** record. If you post a new candidate record to **mshr_hcmcandidatetohireentity** without using deep inserts, you can define values for these properties directly on the **mshr_hcmcandidatetohireentity** record. The associated **mshr_dirpersonentity** record is created implicitly with the defined values for the properties. You can then create any other related entity records (such as skills or education) as separate API calls.

If, however, you want to use deep inserts to create all related entities in one operation, the properties specific to the **mshr_dirpersonentity** entity must be defined on that nested level of the operation.

This example shows how you can create a candidate record, the associated person record, and the person's skills and education in three nested levels using deep inserts in a single API operation.

> [!NOTE]
> The example does not include all properties of each of the API entities. It is simplified for demonstration purposes.
