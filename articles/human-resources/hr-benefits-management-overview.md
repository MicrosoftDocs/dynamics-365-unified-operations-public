# Benefits management overview

[!include [banner](includes/preview-feature.md)]

To remain competitive, you must offer a rich set of benefits to attract and retain your best employees. In addition to standard benefits like medical and dental coverage, you might also want to offer expanded services like adoption assistance, recreation programs, and clothing allowances. The Benefits management preview feature in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources provides you with a flexible solution that supports a wide variety of benefit options. Human Resources also includes an easy-to-use employee experience that showcases your offerings.

- Enhanced benefits plans let you create and manage unique benefit plans and support complex benefit rate tables and nested tiers. You can easily create benefit programs, bundles, and auto-enrollment rules for an easier employee experience.

- Flex credit programs let you prorate to support retirement and other life events.

- Extensive eligibility rules ensure you make the right benefits available to the right employees.

- Online benefits enrollment provides an easy experience for your employees.

- Qualified life event processing integrates with Employee self service, and also supports future life events.

If you would like to access the demo data, you'll need to redeploy your sandbox environment.

## Benefits management known issues

### Eligibility processing

When running eligibility for benefits that use a 1-5X Salary, % of Salary, and Flat Amount coverage amount, you must set the **Benefit details** date to the **Employee start date** in **Employment history**. You must also include **Hours worked**, **Payment frequency**, and **Annual benefits salary amount**. If the worker has fixed compensation, enter **Hours worked** and **Payment frequency**. The annual salary amount will calculate. If the employee is salaried, you don't need to enter **Hours worked**. We recommend that when creating new workers, enter fixed compensation first. To update the benefit details record, navigate to **Worker > Worker history > Employment details**. Adjust the date to the worker's start date.

### Employee self-service

Employee amount doesn't calculate when updating the coverage amount for life insurance. For example, when an employee is offered a life insurance plan, they can select up to $50,000 in coverage at a cost of $.36 per $1,000 of coverage.  When the employee updates the coverage amount, the employeeâ€™s associated cost remains at zero.

For a benefit plan that only allows a single selection of that plan type, the user receives an error if they attempt to waive a plan after selecting a plan. For example, a user selects a medical plan and places it in their cart. The user then selects **Waive** for another medical plan. The user will receive an error.
