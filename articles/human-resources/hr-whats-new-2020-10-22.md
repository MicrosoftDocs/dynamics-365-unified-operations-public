### Bug fixes

The following bug fixes are included in this release.

> [!NOTE]
> Our goal is to get you this information as soon as possible. We may update this topic to include bug fixes that made it into the build after this topic was initially published.

| Issue number| Issue  | Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 437922 | Importing FMLA Hours using the DMF entity results in a read-only error. | Using the FMLA Hours entity to import hours associated to an FMLA case failed. We added logic to ensure that the hours imported don't exceed the hours remaining for the case. |
| 512019 | Incorrect **Last carry-forward** amount. | On the **Time off** page, changing the **As of date** to the first day of next fiscal period displayed an incorrect **Last carry-forward** amount for **Annual leave** type. It now displays the correct amount. |
| 458639 | The **Worker contacts** entity doesn't support change tracking mode. | We updated the **Worker contacts** entity so that you can use it in bring your own database (BYOD) scenarios.|
| 505347 | Training managers could submit a leave request for an employee when the Streamlined worker feature was enabled. | Roles other than HR assistant and HR manager aren't allowed to submit time0off requests for employees. |
| 513490 | Benefits management logging: add logging for plans with no coverage options. | We enabled logging results for **Plan with no coverage options**. They now display in the **Process results** table and are sorted correctly to display at the top. |
| 517021 | Can't select multiple plans with the same **Plan type** code if **Plan type** has one enrollment per type. | We changed the restrictions for selecting plans where only one enrollment is allowed. The restrictions are now at the **Plan type code** level instead of **Plan type**. This change allows plans like HSA and FSA, which are both the same type, but you can give them a separate **Plan type code**. That way, you can select both for the same enrollment period. |
| 444791 | Can't view compensation in Employee self-service when **Restrict access** is turned on in the Compensation plan. | In the Employee self-service **Compensation** card, the current compensation amount and increase percentage displayed "0" if the employee was enrolled in a plan with **Restrict access** turned on and assigned to specific roles. We resolved this issue so the employee and manager can always see compensation details for themselves and their direct reports. |
| 457542 | Updating course details after the course is closed doesn't also update the same information for the employee that took the course. | The employee information now updates properly when you change course details after a course is closed and reopened. |
| 515342 | Can't insert data through **CDSLeaveRequestDetailEntity**. Company isn't found or doesn't exist. | You can now use **CDSLeaveRequestDetailEntity** to insert data. |
| 514743 | Error in **Email parameter** form when using Microsoft Exchange. | The message "Could not load files or assembly..." displayed in the **Email parameters** page when the email provider was set to **Exchange**. This fix also allows the **Email parameters** page to load and save as expected. |
