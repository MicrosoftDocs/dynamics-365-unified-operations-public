# Suspend leave

[!include [banner](includes/preview-feature.md)]

You can suspend leave for an employee to stop leave accruals from being processed for selected leave types. 

## Suspend leave and absence for an employee

1. On the employee's record, select **Leave**.

2. Select **Suspend leave**.

3. Select **New**.

4. In the **Suspend leave accrual** dialog box, select the **Leave type** along with the **Start date** and **End date** for the suspension.

5. Optionally, you can add a **Comment** for the suspension. 

If accruals are processed while the employee's leave is suspended, no accrual will be made for the suspended leave types.
