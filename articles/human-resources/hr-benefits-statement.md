# Benefit statement

The **Benefit statement** report provides a statement of the benefits that an employee is currently enrolled in. The report can be accessed by an employee directly or by the benefit administrator. The **Benefit statement** provides a list of the employeeâ€™s enrolled benefits, coverage options, costs, and any enrolled dependents or beneficiaries. The statement can be printed for a single worker or multiple workers.
