# Create a course


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-1.md)]

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

Human resources administrators and managers can use the courses features to maintain information about the training that's offered to workers.

## Course templates

You can use course templates to categorize courses according to their structure or content. They can be used to prefill information when a new course is created. You can create course templates on the **Course templates** page.

The minimum and maximum number of participants that you can register for a course is defined on the **General** FastTab of the **Courses** page. 

## Course setup type
The following table lists the three setup types for courses. Setup types determine the structure of the course.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Setup</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Standard</strong></td>
<td>Select this type for courses that will not have a daily agenda. This is the default setup type when you create a new course.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Agenda</strong></td>
<td>Select this type to plan the details of each day of a course that takes place over multiple days.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Agenda + session</strong></td>
<td>Select this type for the more complex courses. For example, you can divide the agenda for the course into tracks and sessions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Track</strong> – Tracks are specific subject areas for a course.</li>
<li><strong>Sessions</strong> – Sessions divide up tracks and help identify specific processes or techniques that are relevant to the track.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Course status
The **Course status** field is located at the top of the page. The following table lists the possible course statuses and the actions that you can complete when the course has a specific status.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Status</th>
<th>Actions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Draft</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Create and modify course information.</li>
<li>Change the course status to <strong>Open</strong> so that workers can register for the course. (In-person only)</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Open</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Register participants for the course.</li>
<li>Remove participants from the course.</li>
<li>Confirm participants for the course.</li>
<li>Change the course status to <strong>Closed</strong> or <strong>Canceled</strong>.</li>
<li>Plan questionnaires for participants whose status is <strong>Confirmed</strong>.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Closed</strong></td>
<td>You can reopen the course.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Canceled</strong></td>
<td>You can reopen the course.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
