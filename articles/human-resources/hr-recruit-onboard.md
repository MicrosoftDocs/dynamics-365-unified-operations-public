# Onboard users to use the HR Recruiting app 

This article explains how to onboard users so that they can use the HR Recruiting app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

Users who have licenses are seamlessly onboarded to your Dataverse instance in the background, through automatic synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID.

- If there's no security group in your Microsoft Power Platform setup, all licensed users in your tenant are automatically synchronized.
- If there's a security group (recommended), only licensed users in that group are automatically synchronized to Microsoft Power Platform.

## Synchronize users

To synchronize users, configure the security group.

- Users must be added to the appropriate security group in Microsoft Entra ID.
- Grant users the correct Microsoft Power Platform license.

**Automatic synchronization timing**

- After the setup is completed, wait a few hours for automatic synchronization to be completed.
- For larger groups, synchronization might take more time, depending on the number of users and other factors.

**Manual synchronization option**

As required, select **Refresh** to manually trigger the synchronization process.

By correctly setting up and configuring synchronization, you ensure that users are automatically integrated into your Microsoft Power Platform environment.

For more information, see the following articles:
- [Create a security group and add members to the security group](/power-platform/admin/control-user-access#create-a-security-group-and-add-members-to-the-security-group)
- [Associate a security group with an environment](/power-platform/admin/control-user-access#associate-a-security-group-with-an-environment)
