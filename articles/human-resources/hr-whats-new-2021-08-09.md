| Issue number | Issue | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 558385 | The default designee isn't selected when the **Auto-select designees** option is turned on for default designees. | This issue is now fixed. Multiple default designees are automatically selected in eligible plans when the **Auto-select designees** option on the **Human Resources shared parameters** page is turned on. |
| 589617 | On the **Time off** page, the **Available to buy** and **Available to sell** balances are blank when access is restricted to a specific company. | This issue is now fixed.
