This topic provides general information about questionnaires, and links to more detailed information. A questionnaire is a set of questions that is used to collect information for various purposes. You can design, create, distribute, and complete questionnaires, and then analyze the results. 

You can customize a questionnaire to fit your specific requirements by using various features that are available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. Here are some examples of how questionnaires can be used:

-   Test the professional skills of employees and applicants.
-   Evaluate whether course participants learned the course material.
-   Evaluate a course (for example, the facilities, content, and instructor).
-   Survey employee and customer satisfaction.
-   Evaluate employee job performance.
