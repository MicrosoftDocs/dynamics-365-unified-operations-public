2. Create a leave of absence leave type.
3. Enter the details such as the leave type, description, and workflow ID.
4. In the **Request type** field, select **Leave of absence**.
5. In the details section, for open-ended leaves, set the **Open Ended** option to **Yes**.
6. Set the **Return to work notice** option to **Yes** or **No**.
7. A return-to-work notice can optionally be required for open-ended leave of absence requests.

> [!NOTE]
