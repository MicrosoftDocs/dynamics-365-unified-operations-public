# Understand Date and Time fields

**Date and Time** fields are a fundamental concept in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. It's important to understand how to work with **Date and Time** data in Dynamics 365 Human Resources forms, Common Data Service, and external sources.

## Understanding the difference between Date and Date and Time field data types

**Date and Time** fields contain time zone information, while **Date** fields don't. **Date** fields display the same information in any location. When you enter a date into a **Date** field, Human Resources writes that same date to the database.

When displaying data in a **Date and Time** field, Human Resources adjusts the date and time based on the user's time zone set in the **User Options** form (**Common > Setup > User Options**). The date and time information you enter in the field might not be the same as the information written to the database.

## Understanding Date and Time fields in forms 

When entering data in a **Date and Time** field, the data displayed on the screen isn't the same as the data stored in the database if the user's time zone isn't set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Data in **Date and Time** fields is always stored as UTC.

## Understand Date and Time fields in the database 

When Human Resources writes a **Date and time** value to the database, it stores the data in UTC. This allows users to see any **Date and Time** data relative to the time zone defined in their user options.
 
In the example above, the start time is a point in time, not a particular date. By changing the time zone of the logged in user from GMT +12:00 to GMT UTC, the same record just created shows 04/30/2019 12:00:00 instead of 05/01/2019 12:00:00.
  
In the example below, employee 000724â€™s employment becomes active at the same time regardless of time zone. The employee will be active on 04/30/2019 in the GMT time zone, which is the same as 05/01/2019 in GMT+12:00 time zone. Both refer to the same point in time and not a particular date.

## Date and Time data in Data Management Framework, Excel, Common Data Service, and Power BI 

The Data Management Framework, Excel Add-In, Common Data Service, and Power BI reporting are all designed to interact with data directly on the database level. Since there is no client to adjust **Date and Time** data to the time zone of the user, all **Date and Time** values are in UTC, which can lead to some incorrect assumptions when entering or viewing data.  
 
**Date and Time** data that is submitted via DMF, Excel, or Common Data Service is assumed to be in UTC by the database. This can cause some confusion when the submitted **Date and Time** value doesn't display as expected because the user viewing the data doesn't have their user time zone  set to UTC. 
 
The same thing can happen in reverse when data is exported. The **Date and Time** data in the exported DMF entity can be different then what is displayed in the Dynamics client. 
 
When using external sources like DMF to view or author data, it is important to keep in mind that the **Date and Time** values are considered by default to be in UTC regardless of the time zone of the user's computer or their current user time zone settings.
