2. Select **Leave and absence setup**.

3. Select **Adjust balance**.

4. Select the **Leave type**.

5. Enter an **Adjustment amount**. 

6. Optionally, you can select a **Date**. 

You can include a reason code and comment when adjusting an employee's leave balance. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Viewing additional information about leave balances is in preview. You'll need to enable it in your **Sandbox** environment. For more information about enabling preview features, see [Manage features](hr-admin-manage-features.md).<br>
>When hovering over any leave balance, you will now see:<br>
>- **Available**: Total this year - Take this year
>- **Total this year**: All accruals, adjustments, and carry forward for the year
