# Manage employee leave


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

You can manage an employee's leave by leave type. This includes expiring leave enrollment and adjusting leave type balances. 

## Adjust leave balances

1. On the employee's record, select **Leave**.

2. Select **Leave and absence setup**.

3. Select **Adjust balance**.

4. Select the **Leave type**.

5. Enter an **Adjustment amount**. 

6. Optionally, you can select a **Date**. 

You can include a reason code and comment when adjusting an employee's leave balance. 

Now, when you hover over any leave balance, the following information is shown:

- **Available** – The **Total this year** value minus the **Taken this year** value.
- **Total this year** – All accruals, adjustments, and carry-forward for the year.
- **Taken this year** – All approved time off.
