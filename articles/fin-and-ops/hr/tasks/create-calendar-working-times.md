# Create a calendar and generate working times

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Calendars describe the capacity and working times of operations resources. This procedure will help you define a work calendar based on a working time template. You can walk through this procedure in demo data company USMF, or using your own data.

1. Go to All workspaces > Resource lifecycle management.
2. Click Calendars.
3. Click New.
4. In the Calendar field, type a value.
    * This is the ID of the calendar, which is used as a reference when assigning calendars, such as to an operations resource or a resource group.  
5. In the Name field, type a value.
6. In the Standard work day in hours field, enter a number.
7. In the list, mark the selected row.
8. Click Working times.
9. Click Compose working times.
    * Generate working hours for each day in the period where you want to be able to schedule work. As time goes by, you can generate working times for additional periods.  
10. In the From date field, enter a date.
    * This is the first day that this calendar must be open.  
11. In the To date field, enter a date.
    * This is the last day that this calendar is open.  
12. In the Working time template field, enter or select a value.
    * The working time template defines the working hours for each day of the week.  
13. Click OK.
14. Close the page.
