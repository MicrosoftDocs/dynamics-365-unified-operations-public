# Make a question dependent on the answer of the previous question

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Conditional questions allow you to specify what follow-up question will be presented to a respondent, based on the answer to the preceding question. For example, if you ask "Do you prefer coffee or tea," a logical follow-up question can be determined depending on whether the respondent selects coffee or tea as their answer. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.
