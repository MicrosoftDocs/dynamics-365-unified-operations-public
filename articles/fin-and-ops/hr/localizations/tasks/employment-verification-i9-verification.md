4. Expand the Personal information FastTab.
5. Click Identification numbers.
6. Click New.
7. Select the identification type that you are recording. Example: Passport
8. In the Number field, type a value.
9. Select Yes in the Primary field.
10. In the Description field, enter a brief description of the identification record..
11. In the issuing agency select the agency that issued the form of identification to the worker. Example: Government
12. Enter the date that the issuing agency issued the form of identification to the worker. Example: 02/15/2011

    * The list that you select depends on what form of identification the worker provided. A worker must provide one List A document or one document from List B and C. For example, if the worker provided a passport, then List A could be selected. However, if the worker has only provided their drivers license and social security card, then list B and C must be selected.
