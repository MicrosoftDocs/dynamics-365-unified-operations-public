## Overview: Microsoft FastTrack for Dynamics 365
During FastTrack engagements, the Dynamics FastTrack engineering team will offer customers opportunities to get practical guidance on cloud deployment, help with usage and adoption, and assist with removing blockers during implementation through the following interactions:

-   **Regular touchpoints** are typically 30-minute calls that continue throughout the duration of the engagements. Small technical proof points are sometimes provided to help remove customer roadblocks. Touchpoints are biweekly through the Initiate, Design, and Build phases, and weekly during the Deploy and Operate phases
-   **Workshops** are interactive outcome-based activities, and may involve automation and tooling. Customers and partners can provide input prior to the workshops and customize them for their engagements.
