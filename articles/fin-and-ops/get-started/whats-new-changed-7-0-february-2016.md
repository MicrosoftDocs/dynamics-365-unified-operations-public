This article describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics AX 7.0. This version contains both platform and application features and was released in February 2016.

Cost management
---------------

<table>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>What can you do?</strong></td>
<td><strong>Dynamics AX 2012</strong></td>
<td><strong>Dynamics AX 7.0</strong></td>
<td><strong>Why is this important?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Get  a quick overview of the inventory balance, the work in progress (WIP) inventory balance, and what the inventory inflow and outflow have been for the selected fiscal year.</td>
<td>Not applicable</td>
<td>The <strong>Cost administration</strong> workspace contains a section where the inventory statement or WIP inventory statement is presented for the selected fiscal period. The statement is based on a data set cache that, by default, is updated every 24 hours. The data set cache can be configured so that users can manually update it for real-time reporting. The <strong>Data refresh status card</strong> in the <strong>Cost administration</strong> workspace shows when the cache was last updated.</td>
<td>Cost controllers are interested in knowing whether the inventory or WIP inventory statement balance increases or decreases over time. By classifying operational events in the statement, the cost controller can get an overview of how inventory is flowing. If inventory or WIP inventory is evaluated by standard costs, the overall variance registered can also be seen.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Use the <strong>Cost management</strong> module.</td>
<td>Not applicable</td>
<td>Cost management is introduced as a domain area. Cost-related configuration and insight were scattered throughout Inventory management, Production control, and Accounts Payable.</td>
<td>Because all the tasks that are related to cost management are centralized in one module, it will be easier for cost controllers to maintain the system.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The posting types that are related to inventory accounting and production accounting have been updated.</td>
<td>The labels in the <strong>InventPosting</strong>, <strong>Resource</strong>, <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>, and <strong>ProductionGroup</strong> forms aren't always aligned with the <strong>LedgerPostingType</strong> labels that are actually used. It's not easy to understand the terminology that is used in the labels.</td>
<td>The labels have been updated so that labels on the <strong>InventPosting</strong>, <strong>Resource</strong>, <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>, and <strong>ProductionGroup</strong> pages match the actual <strong>LedgerPostingType</strong> labels. All the labels have also been renamed so that the labels match the operational events. Note that the actual posting logic hasn't been changed.</td>
<td>It's easier to configure the system, because the new labels are related to the operational events that use this posting type.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Import/export the purchase price, cost, or sales price from Microsoft Excel into or from a costing version.</td>
<td>You can't correctly import prices or costs into a costing version, because the data model requires an InventDim ID.</td>
<td>The introduction of data entities makes it possible to implement an import/export feature. This feature lets users import/export prices or costs into a costing version.
<ul>
<li>Import a full list of next year’s purchase prices that is obtained from the Purchasing department.</li>
<li>Push costs and standard sales prices from headquarters to one or more sales companies in one operation.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>It can save the cost controllers a significant amount of time when they maintain the system, especially when they must maintain predetermined costs for the next fiscal year.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Get a quick overview of the inventory balance and average unit cost of a cost object.</td>
<td>The user must open the on-hand form and select the inventory dimensions that reflect the cost object. Therefore, the user must know which inventory dimensions were marked for financial inventory for the specific product.</td>
<td>A new <strong>Cost object</strong> page is introduced. By default, this page shows all cost objects that are related to the product. The page shows the current inventory quantity, value, and average unit cost per cost object.</td>
<td>It removes some of the complexity and makes it easier to be a cost controller.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Use the new <strong>Cost entries</strong> page during inventory control.</td>
<td>It can be complicated to perform inventory control on registered inventory transactions and related settlements, because the same transactions can be physical or financial.</td>
<td>The <strong>Cost entries</strong> page offers a new way to view inventory transactions.
<ul>
<li>Transactions are shown in a chronological order.</li>
<li>Only transactions that contribute to costs are included.</li>
<li>There is no notion of physical costs or financial cost.</li>
<li>There is no notion of physical quantity or financial quantity.</li>
<li>The costs are added incrementally.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>It can save cost controllers a significant amount of time when they must perform inventory control at the transaction level.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Use the new <strong>Production WIP statement</strong> dialog box to see a summarized view of accumulated costs for a specific product.</td>
<td>Not applicable</td>
<td>The WIP statement shows a summarized WIP balance of the specific production order, grouped into appropriate cost classifications. A chart shows, in chronological order, how operational postings have affected the WIP balance.</td>
<td>It can save cost controllers a significant amount of time when they need to know what the current WIP balance is on a specific production order, or how much material has been consumed on the order.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Use the View cost comparison feature that has been introduced on production orders. The feature makes it easier to compare costs that are related to a production order.</td>
<td>The user can compare only estimated costs and realized costs. The comparison can be done at the lowest level.</td>
<td>The cost comparison feature lets cost controllers compare the following data:
<ul>
<li>Active cost versus Estimated cost = Planning variance</li>
<li>Estimated cost versus Realized cost = Production variance</li>
<li>Planning variance + Production variance = Total variance</li>
</ul>
This feature works independently of costing methods that are assigned to the produced item. By default, a chart shows the cost comparison by cost group type. The chart lets users drill into more detailed levels.</td>
<td>It lets cost controllers or production managers analyze where the production variances come from, and what causes them.</td>

The Data Expansion Toolkit lets you correctly expand all performance tests that must have master data and transactional data correctly expanded. The Trace Parser lets you validate a single-user performance test or a multi-user run. The PerfTimer lets you see whether any query or any specific method call is causing a performance issue. Therefore, you don't have to take a trace and analyze everything in detail. |

| Take advantage of the business connector to author business logic and support integration scenarios.         | The business connector is available to call into X++ code from managed code. We recommend that you use the business connector only to author business logic in C\#, not for integration scenarios. | The business connector is no longer supported. The authoring requirement is provided by the fact that X++ is compiled into managed code. Therefore, interop is easier. The integration scenarios are met by using OData.       | You can't use the business connector going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Choose scale (that is, the number of decimal places) on real database fields and extended data types (EDTs). | Scale 16 is the default scale and can't be changed by the developer.                                                                                                                               | EDTs and fields now have a scale property that can be applied to the individual field and EDT. The default is set to 6, not 16.                                                                                                | Performance with NCCI tables (in-memory support in SQL) is faster by orders of magnitude when a smaller scale is used. Change the scale as your use of the individual fields requires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

<td>Access the client anytime, anywhere. </td>
<td>The AX 2012 desktop client provides a full set of forms, but it can run only on computers that run Microsoft Windows and requires installation. Terminal Server is often used with the desktop client to enable access over a wide area network (WAN). The Enterprise Portal web client provides a reduced set of forms.</td>
<td>The two AX 2012 clients have been replaced by a single, standards-based web client that provides the full set of functionality of the desktop client together with the reach of the Enterprise Portal client.</td>
<td>It prevents development efforts from being split between two UI platforms. By using standard web interfaces, it eliminates the need for Terminal Server.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Be productive by using the new Task recorder.</td>
<td>The AX 2012 Task recorder requires direct access to an Application Object Server (AOS) computer and elevated privileges, and provides no editing options.</td>
<td>The new Task recorder can be used directly from the web client. Access to Task recorder doesn't require admin privileges. Recorded steps can be viewed live as you record, new editing options have been introduced, and Task recorder supports more scenarios in addition to existing Business process modeler (BPM) scenarios.</td>

<td>Help users better understand their upcoming work with workspaces.</td>
<td>Role centers provide an overview of information that pertains to a user’s job function in the business or organization.</td>
<td>Workspaces are a new concept in Dynamics AX that are meant to replace role centers as the primary way to navigate to tasks and specific pages. They provide a one-page overview of a business activity and help users to understand the current status, the upcoming workload, and the performance of the process or user. Workspaces are more granular than AX 2012 role centers, and a user may have access to multiple workspaces.</td>
<td>Workspaces are meant to increase user productivity. Developers will need to create a workspace for every significant “activity” supported in the product. A legacy role center from AX 2012 will typically be replaced by multiple workspaces in the current version of Dynamics AX.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Make forms responsive to browser viewport or device size.</td>
<td>In AX 2012, form content was rigidly laid out using columns, and the overall form height/width was largely determined based on the controls on the form.</td>
<td>With the shift to the web in the latest Dynamics AX, a form's dimensions are now based on the browser viewport size or device. Controls and layout parameters have been modified or added to better respond to changes in viewport size.</td>
<td>Form content needs to be more responsive to optimally utilize the available height/width of the browser or device. Achieving responsiveness may require changes in the way a form is modeled.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Use patterns for an enhanced form development experience.</td>
<td>Form templates were available as starting points for form development in AX 2012 based on a form style. The Form Style Checker, an optional add-in, provided information on how a form deviated from its corresponding template.</td>
<td>In the current version of Dynamics AX, form patterns have been introduced. Form patterns represent a combination of form templates and the Form Style Checker tightly integrated into the development experience. Patterns have been defined at the form level (like AX 2012) with additional subpatterns now available at the group and tab page level.</td>
<td>Forms that adhere to patterns have many benefits including a more consistent user interface, a simpler development experience, easier form upgrade path, and increased confidence in form layout responsiveness.</td>

<td>Configure and generate electronic documents to meet the legal requirements in various countries/regions.</td>
<td>Electronic documents are hard-coded in X++ or as Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLTs). Any format adjustments require development efforts. Access to data and formatting aren't isolated. An adjusted format deployment requires a new Microsoft Dynamics AX hotfix package that overrides the existing format. Custom modifications of each format must be manually ported to the source code of a new Microsoft Dynamics AX hotfix package.</td>
<td>Electronic Reporting (ER) is a new tool for configuring and generating electronic documents that target a business user instead of a developer. ER lets you set up data models that are domain-specific and independent of the Microsoft Dynamics AX database as data sources for document formats. A business user can configure the formats, based on these domain-specific data models (for example, for payments, Intrastat reports, or tax reports). The user configures the formats by using simple visual tools that are similar to Excel. ER currently supports the generation of electronic documents in text, XML, and Excel formats. These documents can be generated simultaneously and packed into zip files. Data models and formats support versioning. Format versions can have effective periods. Each data model or format version is stored in a separate configuration and distributed to partners and customers through LCS. Partners and customers can customize Microsoft data models and formats, or create their own. ER saves partner and customer configuration changes as deltas to Microsoft configurations, which simplifies upgrades to new versions of Microsoft configurations. By using LCS, partners can also share their data model and format configurations with other partners and customers, who can customize and share them. Delta customization and easy upgrade are supported through the whole customization chain.</td>
<td>ER simplifies the creation, maintenance, and upgrade of electronic document formats to meet legal requirements in various countries/regions. ER makes the process of creating or changing electronic document formats faster and easier. These changes can be made by business users instead of developers. ER makes it faster and easier for partners and customers to upgrade their format customizations to new versions of formats that are released by Microsoft or other partners. ER provides one common way (through LCS) for Microsoft and partners to distribute electronic document configurations to other partners and customers. ER also makes it easier for partners and customers to customize, upgrade, and distribute electronic document formats for their specific business requirements.</td>

| Perform a check of material availability for production orders on a separate page that is opened from the **Production floor management** workspace. | Not available                                                                                                                    | The production supervisor can check whether materials for scheduled production orders are available on the required date. In the workspace, the production supervisor can see how many production orders are in the scheduled state and pending release. Based on the dynamic master plan, the information about material availability is updated if material requirements are met by on-hand inventory for actual orders or planned orders. Based on the information about material availability, the supervisor can release the orders on the **Material availability** page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | It helps production supervisors make correct decisions about the allocation of materials to orders when production orders are being released to the shop floor.                                                                                                       |
| Start and report progress on production jobs by using the new **Job card device** page.                                                              | The **Job registration** form is primarily targeted at large terminal screens, and the UI is typically accessed via mouse clicks. | Although the new **Job card device **page is designed for simplicity, it's also designed for touch. The page fits well on mobile devices, such as tablets and phones. The shop floor worker will find less information overload and more intuitive ease of use. The worker can perform traditional tasks, such as starting, ending, and reporting progress on a job. Besides working on the actual job, or logging off and clocking out, the worker can view attachments, break for lunch, and perform other activities. Jobs are queued to the worker in a planned sequence, but they can also be picked by the worker. The page is primarily targeted at discrete manufacturing operations, where materials are prepared for production. For scenarios that are related to reporting of co-products and by-products, and materials picking by tracing dimensions, use the **Job registration** page. | By introducing an alternative UI that is designed for touch and can be accessed from all types of devices, such as terminal screens and mobile devices, this feature will help reduce the implementation costs for a traditional rollout of shop floor registrations. |

<td>Get a quick overview of delivery alternatives when you promise orders to customers.</td>
<td>When there are product availability constraints, and the customer's requested delivery date for one or more products on the order can't be met, the order promising task becomes a challenge. To find alternatives that can offset availability and shipping time issues so that the customer’s requested date can be met, or to offer customers a delivery solution that they can accept and trust, the order processor might have to open several forms, each of which offers only a subset of the required information. More specifically, one form shows on-hand quantity across sites, another form shows on-hand quantity in the intercompany setting, a third form lets users calculate the earliest available date for one site/variant at a time, and a fourth form shows supply orders. Therefore, users don't feel confident that they have considered all the relevant options instead of just choosing an immediate but suboptimal solution. Users also don't feel effective, because numerous interruptions occur during the order promising flow as they open and close multiple pages, and combine the insights and options.</td>
<td>Based on the existing algorithms for delivery date calculation, the <strong>Delivery alternatives </strong>page offers a new user experience for order promising:
<ul>
<li>It consolidates relevant information from multiple forms into one space.</li>
<li>It offers “ready-made” alternative delivery packages, such as a combination site/warehousing/variant/transport mode, based on the fastest delivery (earliest available date) criterion that the user can choose from.</li>
<li>It lets the user select options from the simulation interface and transfer them to the sales order line.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>Companies that aspire to provide high customer service while committing to an inventory optimization strategy must be able to promise orders reliably and competitively. After all, their customers’ own business requires that products be available on time. The <strong>Delivery alternatives</strong> task page makes the order promising task quicker, easier, and more systematic by identifying and recommending the best alternative order delivery dates in one interactive place.</td>
