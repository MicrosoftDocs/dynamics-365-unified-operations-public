## Step one:  Try out Finance and Operations free for 30 days

## Step two: Choose a deployment option
You can now deploy Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition in the cloud or on-premises. Cloud deployments offer an ERP service that is fully managed by Microsoft, while on-premises deployments are deployed locally within a customer's data center.

The following considerations must be taken when you choose on-premises as a deployment option:
- Regulatory and compliance needs that are not available in the [cloud certifications](https://explore.dynamics.com/operations/microsoft-dynamics-365-for-operations-certification-priorities)
- Disconnected business process with intermittent internet connectivity required to access Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) for application lifecycle management
- [Features currently not implemented in on-premises deployments](features-not-implemented-on-prem.md)
- [Minimum infrastructure requirements](system-requirements-on-prem.md#minimum-infrastructure-requirements)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On-premises deployments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition are not supported on any public cloud infrastructure, including Azure.
