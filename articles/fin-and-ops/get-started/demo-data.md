## Vendor collaboration
In the USMF demo company, there are three purchase orders for vendor US-104 to use for demonstration purposes. You can log in as user ErinH, who is a contact person who has access to vendor collaboration for US-104.

In the USMF demo company, there are two purchase orders for INGA to approve. You can log in as user INGA to see the purchase orders awaiting approval. 

## Batch transfer rules for subledger journals
The batch transfer rules for subledger journal account entries have been changed to **Scheduled batch** to reflect a best practice. The batches are configured to run every 10 minutes. It is important to understand that accounting entries for all source documents will not be reflected in General ledger until the batch process has run. If you have requirements to see the immediate effect in General ledger, set the **Transfer mode** to **Synchronous** on the **Batch transfer rules** page within **General ledger** parameters. While Synchronous works well for product demos and environments with low transaction volumes, it can cause performance issues in larger transaction volume environments.
