# Workflow types report

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic points you to a report that lists the workflow types that are available in Finance and Operations.

To create a workflow, you must first select the *type* of workflow that you want to create. For example, you may want to create a **Purchase requisition line review** workflow to define who must approve line items on purchase requisitions. For more information about creating a workflow, see [Create a workflow](create-workflow.md).

## View the report
The [Workflow types report](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep)lists each type of workflow that is available. The report also describes what each type of workflow is used for and indicates whether the workflows of each type are associated with a specific company in the organization or with the whole organization.
