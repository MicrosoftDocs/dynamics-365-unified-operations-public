# Set up a B2B e-commerce site

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce sites provide some key capabilities that optimize the workflow for a B2B user. This topic describes how to set up a B2B e-commerce site in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. It goes through the modules and site settings that must be configured to enable B2B-specific scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- To setup a B2B e-commerce site, you must enable and configure specific features in Commerce headquarters, as described in this topic.
- Core experiences, such as product discovery, product details pages, the cart, and checkout are powered by the same modules that are used for business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce sites. Site authors should be familiar with all the modules that Dynamics 365 Commerce supports. For more information, see [Module library overview](../starter-kit-overview.md).
- This topic assumes that site authors understand the basics of Commerce site builder, templates, fragments, and pages, so that they can enable the B2B features for e-commerce sites.

## Site-level settings

You can access site-level settings in site builder, at **Site Settings \> Extensions**. The following two site-level settings apply to B2B scenarios:

- **Enable customer account payments** – This property enables users to pay for orders by using customer accounts. The available values are **Enabled for B2B customers**, **Enabled for B2C customers**, **Enabled for all customers**, and **Disabled for all customers**. If your B2B site supports customer accounts, you should select **Enabled for B2B customers**.
- **Enable order quantity limits** – This property lets you set limits on the number of items that can be ordered for each product or category. The available values are **Enabled for B2B customers**, **Enabled for B2C customers**, **Enabled for all customers**, and **Disabled for all customers**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you upgrade to the latest version of the module library, you must follow additional steps to ensure that the previously described site settings are available in your environment. For more information, see [Update the app.settings.json file](../e-commerce-extensibility/sdk-updates.md#update-the-appsettingsjson-file).

## Create business partner sign-up pages

To become a business partner, users must first submit a business partner request. A link to the business partner request page will be available on the B2B home page, so that users can initiate the process. After users submit a business partner request, they will receive confirmation that the request has been submitted. 

### Create a business partner request page

The **Partner sign up** module on a business partner request page is used to initiate user requests to become business partners. This module lets you collect the user information that is required for the sign-up process. Additionally, the **Business account address** module is used to capture the user's address.

To set up and configure the business partner request page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Create a template that is named **Sign-up**. This template should include the following modules:

    - Partner sign up
    - Breadcrumb
    - Header
    - Footer
    - Content block
    - Text block
    - Product collection

1. Use the **Sign-up** template to create a page that is named **Business Partner Request**.
1. In the **Header** slot, add the header fragment that is preconfigured with the site header.
1. In the **Footer** slot, add the footer fragment that is preconfigured with the site footer.
1. In the **Main** slot, add a **Container** module. In the module properties pane, set the **Width** value to **Fill Container**.
1. In the **Container** slot, add a **Breadcrumb** module. In the module properties pane, under **Links**, configure a link to the home page, and enter **Home** as the link text.
1. In the **Container** slot, add a **Partner sign up** module below the **Breadcrumb** module. In the module properties pane, under **Heading**, enter **Become a business partner**.
1. In the **Partner sign up** slot, add a **Business account address** module.
1. In the **Container** slot, add a **Text block** module below the **Partner sign up** module. Here, you can define some terms and conditions for the sign-up process.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Preview** to preview the page.
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.
1. Publish the URL for the page.

### Create a business partner request confirmation page

After a business partner request is submitted, a confirmation page should be shown to the user to acknowledge the submission. 

To set up and configure the request confirmation page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Use the **Sign-up** template that you created earlier to create a page that is named **Partner Request Confirmation**.
1. In the **Header** slot, add the header fragment that is preconfigured with the site header.
1. In the **Footer** slot, add the footer fragment that is preconfigured with the site footer.
1. In the **Main** slot, add a **Container** module. In the module properties pane, set the **Width** value to **Fill Container**.
1. In the **Container** slot, add a **Content block** module. In the module properties pane, under **Heading**, enter **Request submitted**. In the **Rich Text** field, enter **Your request has been submitted**. Under **Links**, configure a link to the home page, and enter **Back to shopping** as the link text.
1. Add another **Container** module, and add a **Product Collection** module to it.
1. Configure the **Product Collection** module with the recommendation or category list that you want to showcase on the page.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Preview** to preview the page.
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.
1. Publish the URL for the page.

To add a link to the request confirmation page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to the **Business Partner Request** page that you created earlier, and select **Edit**. 
1. Select the **Partner sign up** module slot. In the properties pane, under **Link to the Sign-Up Confirmation page**, configure the link to the business partner request page that you created earlier. 
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

### Add a business partner request link to the home page

After the business partner request sign-up and confirmation pages are created, you must make the sign-up page accessible through a link on the home page. You can complete this task by adding the link to any **Content block** module on the home page.

To add a business partner request link to the home page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to the home page for your site, and select **Edit**.
1. Select a **Content block** module slot. In the module properties pane, under **Links**, configure a link to the business partner request page that you created earlier, and enter **Sign up to be a business partner** or similar text as the link text. Add an image as appropriate.
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

The **Customer Account Payment** module is required to enable the customer balance to be used as a form of payment. This module should be added to the checkout page as a form of payment. For information about how to configure a checkout page and the modules that are required for checkout, including all payment details, see [Checkout module](../add-checkout-module.md).

After you've configured a checkout page, you must add the **Customer Account Payment** module to the payment section, and then save and publish the page. B2B users will then be able sign in to the e-commerce site and apply their available customer balance to orders during checkout.

In addition, at **Site Builder \> Extensions**, you must make sure that the **Enable customer account payments** property is set to **Enabled for B2B customers**.
