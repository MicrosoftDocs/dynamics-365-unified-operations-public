# Welcome email isn't sent when new customers are created

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides troubleshooting guidance that can help if a welcome email notification isn't sent when a new customer is created in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Description

When a new customer is created in Commerce headquarters, a welcome email isn't sent to the customer, even though an email notification is configured for the **Customer created** email notification type.

## Resolution

### Associate an email notification profile under Commerce parameters

1. In headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Parameters \> Commerce parameters \> General**.
2. In the **Email notification profile** drop-down list, select the email notification profile that contains a mapping between the customer created notification type and a customer created email template.  

> [!NOTE] 
> When you enable customer created notifications, customers that are created in all channels within the legal entity will receive a customer created email. Currently, customer created notifications can't be limited to a single channel.

For more information, see [Create email templates for transactional events](../email-templates-transactions.md).
