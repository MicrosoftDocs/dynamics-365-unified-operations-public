# Refund on a return order is declined

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides troubleshooting guidance that can help when a refund on a return order is declined because the credit card that is used for invoicing differs from the card that was used during the original payment authorization.

## Description

A refund is declined when the credit card that is used to invoice a return order differs from the card that was used during the original payment authorization. You receive the following error message: "Some payments are not in the correct status for posting. Please re-validate the status of all payments prior to invoicing."

The payment authorization details will include the following error message: "Adyen gateway SendRequest() failed with status 'InternalServerError'.22144; Empty response returned from Adyen.(22001);"
