# Create dynamic e-commerce pages based on URL parameters

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to set up a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce e-commerce page that can serve dynamic content, based on URL parameters.

An e-commerce page can be configured to serve different content, based on a segment in the URL path. Therefore, the page is known as a dynamic page. The segment is used as a parameter to retrieve the page content. For example, a page that is named **blog\_viewer** is created and associated with the URL `https://fabrikam.com/blog`. This page can then be used to show different content, based on the last segment in the URL path. For example, the last segment in the URL `https://fabrikam.com/blog/article-1` is **article-1**.

Separate custom pages that override the dynamic page can also be associated with segments in the URL path. For example, a page that is named **blog\_summary** is created and associated with the URL `https://fabrikam.com/blog/about-this-blog`. When this URL is requested, the **blog\_summary** page that is associated with the **/about-this-blog** parameter is returned instead of the **blog\_viewer** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The functionality for hosting, retrieving, and showing dynamic page content is implemented by using a custom module. For more information, see [Online channel extensibility](e-commerce-extensibility/overview.md).

## Set up a dynamic e-commerce page

To set up a dynamic e-commerce page, you must create the dynamic page, create the base URL, and configure the route to the dynamic page.

### Create the page that will serve dynamic content

To create a page that will serve dynamic content, follow the steps in [Add a new site page](add-new-page.md). The page that you create will require implementation of a module that uses the last segment in the URL path to retrieve content from an external data source. For more information about custom module development, see [Online channel extensibility](e-commerce-extensibility/overview.md).

### Create the base URL for the dynamic page

To create the base URL for the dynamic page in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **URLs**, and select **New \> New URL**.
1. In the **Create new URL** dialog box, select **Internal page**. Under **URL path**, enter the path that will serve as the root for the dynamic page (in this example, **/blog**). Then select **Next**.
1. In the **Select a page** dialog box, select the page that you created to serve as the dynamic page, and then select **Save**.
1. Select **Publish**.

### Configure the route to the dynamic page

To configure the route to the dynamic page in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Site Settings \> Extensions**.
1. Under **Parameterized URL paths**, select **Add**, and then enter the URL path that you entered when you created the URL (in this example, **/blog**).
1. Select **Save and publish**.

After the route is configured, all requests to the parameterized URL path will return the page that is associated with that URL. If any requests contain an additional segment, the associated page will be returned, and the page content will be retrieved by using the segment as a parameter. For example, `https://fabrikam.com/blog/article-1` will return the **blog\_summary** page, and the page content will be retrieved by using the **/article-1** parameter.

## Override a parameterized URL with a custom page

To override a parameterized URL with a custom page in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **URLs**, and select **New \> New URL**.
1. In the **Create new URL** dialog box, select **Internal page**. Under **URL path**, enter the path that includes the segment to override (in this example, **/blog/about-this-blog**). Then select **Next**.
1. In the **Select a page** dialog box, select the custom page, and then select **Save**.
1. Select **Publish**.
1. If the custom page hasn't yet been published, go to **Pages**, select the custom page, and then select **Publish**.

After the custom page is published, it will be served instead of the dynamic page that has parameterized content.
