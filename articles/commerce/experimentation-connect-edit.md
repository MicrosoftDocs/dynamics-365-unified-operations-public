# Connect an experiment and edit variations

This article describes how to connect your experiment in Commerce and make changes to your variations so that they align with your hypothesis. 

The following diagram shows all of the steps involved in setting up and running an experiment on an e-Commerce website in Dynamics 365 Commerce. Additional steps are covered in separate articles.

After you've [set up your experiment](experimentation-setup.md) in a third-party service, you'll connect the experiment in Dynamics 365 Commerce and edit the experiment variations.

## Connect your experiment
To connect your experiment, you'll launch the **Connect experiment** wizard. The wizard walks you through the steps required to connect your experiment. When you complete the wizard, your experiment is connected and variations are created and ready to be edited.

To get started connecting your experiment in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. To launch the **Connect experiment** wizard, select **Experiments** in the left navigation pane, and then select **Connect**. Alternatively, you can access the wizard from a page or fragment editor by editing it and selecting **Connect experiment** on the command bar.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - A page can only be connected to one experiment at a time. To connect a page to a different experiment, first delete the experiment that the page is currently connected to.
    > - You can only experiment on pages with a custom layout. If your page has a preset layout, convert it to a custom layout first. You can do this by going to the page and selecting **Convert to custom layout** on the command bar. For more information on layouts, see [Preset and custom layouts](templates-layouts-overview.md#preset-and-custom-layouts). 

1. If you are connecting to an experiment from the **Experiments** tab in the left navigation pane, select the experiment name from the list that appears.
1. Select the page or fragment you want to run your experiment on.
1. In the final step of the wizard, select **Generate variations and exit wizard**. Variations are created for the experiment. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to schedule when your experiment is published to your live site, make sure the content you want to associate with the experiment is available in a publish group *before* you connect the experiment. For more information about publish groups, refer to [Work with publish groups](publish-groups.md).

## Edit your variations

When you exit the **Connect experiment** wizard, variations are created for you. Follow the steps below to edit the variations so that they reflect the choices that you need to verify in the experiment hypothesis.

1. In editor view, use the variations drop-down menu below the command bar to edit each variation based on your original hypothesis. You may also want to establish a control or base variation by leaving one of the variations unchanged.
1. Select the module to be experimented on, select the ellipsis (...), and then select **Add to experiment**.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider establishing a control or base variation by leaving one of the variations unchanged.
