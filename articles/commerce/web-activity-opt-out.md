# Opt out of web activity event collection
[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how you can let customers opt out of web activity event collection in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Dynamics 365 Commerce lets site administrators analyze the web activity of users of their e-commerce sites. In that way, they can better understand how their sites are used, and they can optimize the sites to provide an improved user experience and meet business objectives.


## Ways for administrators to implement an opt-out experience

Administrators have three ways to implement an opt-out experience.

### Opt out on behalf of users

In Account management in Commerce headquarters (HQ), administrators can opt out on behalf of users.

1. In the HQ client, on the **All customers** page, search for and select a customer.
1. On the customer details page, on the **Retail** FastTab, in the **Privacy** section, set the **Do not track web activity** option to **Yes**.

1. Select **Save**, and then close the page.

### Module-based opt-out experience

Administrators can let authenticated users opt out of web activity event collection by themselves. To provide this opt-out experience, add the user opt-out module to customer account profile pages.

### Custom extensions

Administrators can create their own extensions to manage the opt-out experience for users. For more information, see [Call Retail Server APIs](e-commerce-extensibility/call-retail-server-apis.md) and [Online channel extensibility](e-commerce-extensibility/overview.md).
