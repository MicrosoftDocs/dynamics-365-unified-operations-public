> The Store Commerce apps for Windows, Android, and iOS are the next generation POS applications for Dynamics 365 Commerce. The Store Commerce apps offer numerous improvements over their predecessors while retaining full functional and feature parity. Microsoft will deprecate MPOS and the Retail hybrid apps for Android and iOS in October 2023, and recommends that you use the Store Commerce apps for Windows, Android, and iOS and Store Commerce for web for all new POS deployments. Existing customers should plan to migrate from MPOS and the Retail hybrid apps to Store Commerce.
