This article describes how to configure channel-side inventory calculation in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Enable the feature

To use channel-side inventory calculation, you must first enable the **Optimized product availability calculation** feature.

### Commerce version 10.0.29 and later

In Commerce version 10.0.29 and later, the **Optimized product availability calculation** feature is marked as mandatory. In other words, it's enabled by default and can't be disabled. Therefore, no action is required to enable the feature.

### Commerce versions 10.0.12 through 10.0.28

If you're using Commerce versions 10.0.12 through 10.0.28, follow these steps to enable the **Optimized product availability calculation** feature.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to **Workspaces \> Feature management**.
1. Find and enable the **Optimized product availability calculation** feature.
1. If your online and store channels use the same fulfillment warehouses, you must also enable the **Enhanced e-Commerce channel-side inventory calculation logic** feature. The channel-side calculation logic will then consider unposted transactions that are created in the store channel. Unposted transactions can be cash-and-carry transactions, customer orders, and returns.
1. Run the **1070** (**Channel configuration**) job.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Commerce environment was upgraded from a release that's earlier than Commerce version 10.0.8, after you enable the **Optimized product availability calculation** feature, it won't take effect until you also run the Initialize commerce scheduler at **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler**.

### Commerce versions 10.0.8 through 10.0.11

If you're using Commerce versions 10.0.8 through 10.0.11, follow these steps to enable the **Optimized product availability calculation** feature.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Commerce shared parameters**.
1. On the **Inventory** tab, in the **Product availability job** field, select **Use optimized process for product availability job**.

## Configure the Product availability job

As a prerequisite to using channel-side inventory calculation, a periodic snapshot of inventory data from Commerce headquarters must be sent to the channel databases. This snapshot is created by the **Product availability** job and represents the information that Commerce headquarters has about inventory availability for a specific combination of a product or product variant and a warehouse. The snapshot includes only inventory transactions that had already been processed and posted in Commerce headquarters when the snapshot was taken. It might not be 100-percent accurate in real time because of the constant sales processing that occurs across distributed servers.

- If inventory was sold for a product in a store through a cash-and-carry or asynchronous customer order sale in the point of sale (POS) application, Commerce headquarters won't immediately have information about the related inventory issue transaction for the sale. It will have information about the inventory that's sold for these types of store sales only after the P-job uploads the related transaction from the store's channel database into Commerce headquarters, and after the related sales orders are created through statement posting or the trickle-feed posting processes. The process of creating the orders in Commerce headquarters creates the related inventory transactions.
- For e-commerce channel orders, Commerce headquarters has information about the inventory transactions only after the transactions are sent to Commerce headquarters via the P-job and the order synchronization process is completed.

To take a snapshot of inventory in Commerce headquarters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Retail and Commerce IT \> Products and inventory \> Product availability**.
1. Select **OK** to run the **Product availability** job. You can also schedule this job to run in batch mode.

## Configure the Distribution schedule job

After the **Product availability** job has finished running, the data that was captured must be pushed to the channel databases. The latest Commerce headquarters inventory snapshot can then be considered in the channel-side calculation of estimated on-hand inventory.

To sync snapshot data from Commerce headquarters to your channel databases, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Retail and Commerce IT \> Distribution schedule**.
1. Run the **1130** (**Product availability**) job to sync the snapshot data that the **Product availability** job created from Commerce headquarters to your channel databases.
