# Upload images

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to upload images in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder.

The Commerce site builder Media Library allows you to upload images, either singly or in bulk using folders. You should always upload the version of the image with highest resolution and quality, because the image resizer component will automatically optimize the image for different viewports and their breakpoints.

### Image information specified during upload

When uploading an image, the following information can be specified.

- **Title, Alt Text, Description, Keywords**: Metadata of the image or images. Title and alt text are required values.
- **Select category**:
    - **None**: Used for an e-Commerce storytelling image or images.
    - **Product, Category, Customer, Employee, Catalog**: Used for Dynamics 365 Commerce omni-channel image or images.
- **Publish assets after upload**: When this check box is selected, the image or images are published immediately after upload.

> [!NOTE]
> Image assets with a category assigned are also automatically tagged with the category as a keyword to aid searching for assets of a specific category.

### Naming conventions for omni-channel images 

If you have configured the Media Library as the omni-channel image backend, you can use image categories to indicate which category the uploaded image belongs to. There is also a naming convention that should be followed to ensure that images are retrieved correctly by other channels, such as point of sale (POS).

The default naming convention varies based on the category:
- Catalog images should be named "**/Catalogs/\{LanguageId\}/\{CatalogName\}.jpg**"
- Category images should be named "**/Categories/\{CategoryName\}.png**"
- Customer images should be named "**/Customers/\{CustomerNumber\}.jpg**"
- Employee images should be named "**/Workers/\{WorkerNumber\}.jpg**"
- Product images should be named "**/Products/\{ProductNumber\}\_000_001.png**"
    - 001 is the sequence of the image and it can be 001, 002, 003, 004 or 005
- Product variant images should be named "**/Products/\{ProductNumber\} \^ \{Style\} \^ \{Size\} \^ \{Color\} \^\_000_001.png**"
    - For example: 93039 \^ &nbsp;\^ 2 \^ Black \^\_000_001.png
- Product variant images with configuration dimension should be named "**/Products/\{ProductNumber\} \^ \{Configuration\}\_000_001.png**"
    - For example: 93039 \^ LB8017_000_001.png

> [!NOTE]
> For product variant images, if the dimension value is empty there must be two whitespaces between the carets in the file name.

The examples above use the default configuration. The separator character and dimensions are configurable and the exact naming required may vary between deployments. One method of identifying the exact naming convention required is to use the developer console of the browser to inspect the product variant image requests while changing the product dimensions on the storefront product details page (PDP).
