[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article walks through an example procedure where a call center user looks up a customer, creates a new order, searches for a product, and collects payment from the customer in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. The procedure uses the USRT demo data company and is intended for sales order clerks. 

## Prerequisites

1. In the **User ID** field, enter your user ID.
1. In the **Name** field, enter your user name. The user name can be the same as the user ID.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.
1. Go back to **Retail and Commerce \> Channels \> Call centers \> All call centers**.
