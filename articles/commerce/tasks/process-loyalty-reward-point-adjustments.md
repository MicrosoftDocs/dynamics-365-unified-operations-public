This article explains how to look up loyalty card information and adjust loyalty reward points in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The following procedure demonstrates how to look up loyalty card information and adjust loyalty reward points. The procedure uses the USRT demo data company, and is intended for the operations manager or customer service manager roles.
