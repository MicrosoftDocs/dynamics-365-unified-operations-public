# Overview of account management pages


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of account management pages in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Account management pages let customers view information that is related to their account and orders. Account management pages include the account management landing page, and pages for the user's profile, addresses, order history, order details, loyalty points, and wish list.

### Account management landing page

When a customer signs in and selects **My Account**, the account management landing page is opened. This page provides a quick summary of all account-related information, such as the user's profile, orders, wish list, addresses, loyalty points. From this page, the customer can access more details for each area.

The following illustration shows an example of the account management landing page.

### My profile page

The **My profile** page shows customer's account information, such as his or her name and phone number. The customer can update his or her profile information on this page. This page can be customized so that it includes additional customer account preferences, such as an option for opting in to marketing email.

The following illustration shows an example of a **My profile** page that was built by using the starter kit.

### Addresses page

The **Addresses** page lets the customer add addresses to his or her account. It also shows the list of addresses that the customer has previously added or saved to the account. These addresses are addresses that the customer entered either on this page or while placing an order.

The following illustration shows an example of the **Addresses** page.

### Order history and Order details pages

The **Order history** page shows a summary of all orders that the customer has submitted by using his or her account. It gives a quick summary of the items that were ordered, the confirmation number, sales ID, tracking information, and other information. If the customer wants to view a more detailed breakdown of each order, there is an **Order details** page. This page includes information such as the shipping address, payment information, discounts, taxes, and shipping costs for the order.

The following illustration shows an example of the **Order history** page.

The following illustration shows an example of a **Loyalty program** page.

### Wishlist page

The **Wishlist** page shows a list of the items that the customer has added to his or her wish list. Both products and product variants can be added to the wish list. From this page, the customer can remove an item from the wish list or add an item directly to the cart.
