# Create curated product recommendation lists

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how merchandizers can create and manage manual product lists for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce customers.

Curated lists are collections of individual content, created and curated by people.  

## Create a new list

To create a curated product recommendation list, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce &gt; Product recommendations &gt; Recommendation lists**.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **List Id** field, enter a value.
1. In the **List name** field, enter a value.
    - The **List name** is the title of the list that will appear in the curated lists section of the **Product collection** module.
1. To add products to the list, select **Add products**.
1. To change the order of the products in the list, enter a value in the **Display order** column.
    - If two products have the same display order value, then the final order of those two results may differ from the back office.
1. Select **Save** to save the list.
