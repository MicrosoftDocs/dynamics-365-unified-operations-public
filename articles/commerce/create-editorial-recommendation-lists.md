# Manually create curated recommendations

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how merchandisers can manually create and manage product recommendations lists for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce customers.

Curated lists are collections of individual content, created and curated by people.  

## Create a new list

To create a curated product recommendation list, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce > Product recommendations > Recommendation lists**.
1. Select **New**.
1. Enter a value in the **List Id** field.
1. Enter a value in the **List name** field.
    - The **List name** is the title of the list that appears in the curated lists section of the **Product collection** module.
1. Select **Add products** to add products to the list.
1. Enter a value in the **Display order** column to change the order of the products in the list.
    - If two products have the same display order value, the final order of those two results might differ from the back office.
1. Select **Save** to save the list.
