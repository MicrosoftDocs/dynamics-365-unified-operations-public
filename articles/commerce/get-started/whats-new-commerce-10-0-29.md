## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that were added to the build after this article was originally published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|---------|------------------|----------------|--------------| 
| B2B | [Enable support for sales agreement across channels](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enable-b2b-sales-agreement-contract-based-pricing) | This feature enables business-to-business (B2B) seller organizations to use sales agreements in Commerce headquarters to define contract-based pricing for their buyers. When a B2B buyer shops on the e-commerce website, the contract-based pricing that is configured for the B2B buyer organization is automatically applied to the whole product discovery, purchase, and checkout experience. | Feature management<p>*Support for sales agreement across commerce channels* |
| Customer Service | [Enable Customer Service with Dynamics 365 Omnichannel for Customer Service](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/chat-dynamics-365-commerce-omnichannel-customer-service) | A first-class customer support experience is key to providing a personalized and delightful commerce experience for consumers. Multiple commerce touchpoints currently exist, such as physical stores, online channels, and social channels. Consumers expect a personalized support experience in all these touchpoints. This feature helps you increase cart conversions to sales, increase personalized engagement with consumers, and enhance customer service by integrating with Dynamics 365 Omnichannel for Customer Service. | Enabled by admin/makers |
| E-commerce | Support for product comparison in e-commerce | Enable shoppers to compare products across a wide range of categories so that they can make the correct purchase decision for themselves. This feature is available for both business-to-consumer (B2C) and B2B sites. | Site builder | 
| Gift cards | Support for retail gift card tables for cross-company data sharing | Dynamics headquarters supports the ability to enable cross-company data sharing for specific tables in the Dynamics architecture. In this feature, Dynamics 365 Commerce adds support for cross-company data sharing for the retail gift card tables. Therefore, a gift card in one company can now have its data duplicated to another company in the environment. Changes that are made to the originating company gift card table will be shared to the duplicated company gift card table. | Developers |
| Globalization | [Enable Commerce localization features for new Commerce SDK](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enable-commerce-localization-features-new-commerce-sdk) | The new feature provides the possibility to enable Commerce localization features from Commerce headquarters by using the feature management framework or parameters. Fiscal integration samples are now included in the new Commerce SDK and support independent packaging. This feature also enables the adoption of the Store Commerce app by global Commerce customers.<p><p>This release includes Commerce localization features and fiscal integration samples for [Austria](../localizations/emea-aut-fi-sample.md), [the Czech Republic](../localizations/emea-cze-fi-sample.md), [France](../localizations/emea-fra-cash-registers.md), [Germany](../localizations/emea-deu-fi-sample.md), [Italy](../localizations/emea-ita-fpi-sample.md), [Norway](../localizations/emea-nor-cash-registers.md), and [Poland](../localizations/emea-pol-fpi-sample.md). | Enabled by admin/makers |
| Offline | [POS offline database compression](../dev-itpro/implementation-considerations-offline.md#important-offline-features) | This new feature reduces offline database sizes by enabling automated index compression outside of channel [store hours](../dev-itpro/store-hours.md). | Feature management<p>*POS offline database compression* |
| Performance | Remove RTS dependency for "edit customer" scenarios | High availability and high performance are default expectations for point of sale (POS) and e-commerce channels. To help meet these expectations, Dynamics 365 Commerce channels no longer have to rely on real-time communication with Commerce headquarters when customer information is edited. The ability to edit customer information asynchronously for asynchronous and non-asynchronous customers can help reduce real-time calls to Commerce headquarters. | Enabled by admin/makers |

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
