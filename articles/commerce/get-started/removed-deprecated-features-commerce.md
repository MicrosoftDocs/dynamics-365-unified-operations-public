## Features removed or deprecated in the Commerce 10.0.11 release
### Data action hooks
|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The data action hooks feature has been deprecated due to performance issues. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | We recommend using [data action overrides](../e-commerce-extensibility/data-action-overrides.md) to modify business logic in the data action layer.|
| **Product areas affected**         | e-Commerce extensibility data actions |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: As of release 10.0.11 |

### Retail SDK support for Visual Studio 2015, msbuild 14.0, and Retail SDK\Reference libraries and tools
|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Retail SDK support for Visual Studio 2015 has been deprecated and updated to support VS 2017, msbuild 15.0 and all the reference libraries and commerce proxy generator tools in the RetailSDK\References folder moved to NuGet packages to simplify the extension model and SDK upgrade process.|
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | We recommend that you follow the information in [Migrate the Retail SDK from Visual Studio 2015 to Visual Studio 2017](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/migrate-sdk.md) to update your system. |

|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Retail server extension using IEdmModelExtender and CommerceController has been deprecated to provide simplified extension model. The new implementation will have only the controller class without any additional IEdmModelExtender class implementation. This also avoids the dependency with a particular OData version (if the OData version is updated it may break extensions.) |

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Hardware station extension using IHardwareStationController has been deprecated to provide simplified extension model. The new implementation will have only the IController class without any additional class implementation and to avoid the dependency with core hardware station libraries, previously extension need to refer multiple libraries.) |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | It is recommended to use the IController class extension model by importing the NuGet (Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Hosting.Contracts) package. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Hardware station extensions |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: As of release 10.0.11 |

Only critical bug fixes will be done for this operation in future releases.
