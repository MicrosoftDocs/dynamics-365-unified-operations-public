B2B Buyers can only view channels that are relevant to them, based on mappings established in Commerce headquarters and site builder.<p><p>- Channel switching with cart integrity: B2B buyers can now quickly switch between distributor channels. For example, when browsing products from one channel, they can switch to another. The cart remains consistent and linked to the original distributor's channel, ensuring that the product selection in one distributor channel's cart doesn't mix with another.<p><p>- Dynamic catalog reset: Upon changing the distributor channel, the product catalog selection is automatically reset, ensuring that users always see products relevant to the chosen distributor channel. | By default  |

Upon approval of the B2B seller prospect, the system creates a B2B online channel associated with the B2B seller. Specifics such as catalogs, inventory, pricing, and promotions can then be controlled at a channel level. Following the successful onboarding, an employee record is created, granting admin members from the B2B seller organization access to manage orders and stock using headless commerce APIs. A customer hierarchy is also generated, designed to streamline user management for the B2B seller organization.  | Feature management<p><p>"Enable B2B2B setup and enhancements to B2B Commerce orders"  |
