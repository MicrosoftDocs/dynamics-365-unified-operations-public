It unifies Modern Point of Sale (MPOS) and Cloud Point of Sale (CPOS) into a single application, provides deployment choices to retailers, helps improve performance, and offers superior application lifecycle management (ALM). It also retains all the functionality of MPOS and CPOS, including extensibility. See [Store Commerce app](../dev-itpro/store-commerce.md). |Opt-in |

This type of connector will communicate with a fiscal device or service that provides an HTTP API and will not require a dedicated physical machine in the store to be plugged in or deployed on. For more information, see [Overview of fiscal integration for Commerce channels](../localizations/fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#fiscal-registration-is-done-via-a-device-or-service-in-the-local-network) and [Create connector technical profiles](../localizations/setting-up-fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#create-connector-technical-profiles). | Feature management<p>*Direct fiscal integration from POS registers*| 
| Globalization | [Enhanced fiscal connector configuration](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enhanced-fiscal-connector-configuration) | The feature extends the fiscal integration framework by adding an option to define connection settings for a fiscal connector on the individual POS register level, in addition to the hardware profile level. This will provide the ability to configure different connection settings for individual fiscal devices or service instances used by different POS registers in the store. For more information, see [Create connector technical profiles](../localizations/setting-up-fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#create-connector-technical-profiles). |  Feature management<p>*Fiscal integration technical profile overrides* |

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
