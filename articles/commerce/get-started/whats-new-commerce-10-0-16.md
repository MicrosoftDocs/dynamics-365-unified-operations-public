### Removed and deprecated features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) topic describes features that have been removed or deprecated for Commerce.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
