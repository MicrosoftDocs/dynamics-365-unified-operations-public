### Removed and deprecated Commerce features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article describes features that are removed or deprecated for Commerce.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice is announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article 12 months before removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time is less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
