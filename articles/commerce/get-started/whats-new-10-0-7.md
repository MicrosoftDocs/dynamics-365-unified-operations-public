[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]


This topic describes features that are new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Retail in 10.0.7. This version has a build number of 10.0.283, and is available as follows:

For more information about version 10.0.7, see [Additional resources](whats-new-10-0-7.md#additional-resources).

## Clienteling
Many retailers, especially high-end specialty retailers, want their sales associates to form long-term relationships with their key customers. The sales associates are expected to know about their customer's likes and dislikes, purchase history, product preferences, important dates such as anniversary, birthday etc. Associates need a place to capture such information and easily find the information when needed. Once this information is available in a single view, associates can easily target customers that meet certain criteria (for example, find all the customers that prefer to shop for handbags or find customers with an important life event approaching such as a birthday, anniversary, or graduation). The new clienteling capabilities in in Dynamics 365 Retail can help your associates easily build and maintain such relationships.

## Tender-based discounts
It has now become a common practice for retailers to release private branded credit cards. Retailers benefit from getting preferred rates from the banks, and according to a study, such credits cards result in an increase in the store visit frequency, thus directly improving the bottom line of the retailer. So, retailers are motivated to increase the usage frequency of such credit cards. To achieve this goal, retailers often provide additional discounts for using these cards.With this feature, the retailers can configure a discount percentage that would be applied on the qualified lines if the user pays using the preferred tender.  

## Hardware station mass deployment
As companies increase in size, massive deployment and installation of components such as hardware station has become relatively unmanageable. The new hardware station mass deployment feature allows users to silently perform a mass deployment of the hardware station. In addition to dramatically reducing the difficulty of initial and long-term deployment and maintenance, this feature will enhance the hardware station flow, which can increase reliability and resiliency. Retailers can choose the deployment tool of their choice (such as System Center) to deploy and service this component. This will provide improvements to reliability and resiliency over time for the hardware station on top of the enhanced speed and ease with which deployment occurs.

### Removed and deprecated features

The [Removed or deprecated features](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) topic describes features that have been removed or deprecated for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
