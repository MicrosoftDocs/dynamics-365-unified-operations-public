| Feature area   | Feature                                                  | More information                                          |  Enabled by             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
|   Globalization      |    [Payments in installments with the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen for Brazil](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/payments-installments-dynamics-365-payment-connector-adyen-brazil)    |   This feature extends the out-of-the-box Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen to support paying in installments for Brazil. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen in Commerce POS for Brazil](../localizations/latam-bra-adyen.md).       | For more information, see [Set up the Adyen payment connector for Dynamics 365](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/microsoft-dynamics). |
|   Globalization      |    [Sample of direct fiscal integration from POS with EFR](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/direct-fiscal-integration-pos)    |     The feature extends the fiscal integration framework by adding a capability to create fiscal connectors that will be executed in POS. This type of connector will communicate with a fiscal device or service that provides an HTTP API and will not require a dedicated physical machine in the store to be plugged in or deployed on. This release provides a sample of the direct fiscal integration from POS with the Electronic Fiscal Register service (EFR) for [Austria](../localizations/emea-aut-fi-sample.md), [the Czech Republic](../localizations/emea-cze-fi-sample.md), and [Germany](../localizations/emea-deu-fi-sample.md).   | Feature management<p>*Direct fiscal integration from POS registers*<p>Configuration of fiscal registration process |
|   Globalization      |    [Disable fiscal registration for selected POS registers](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enhanced-fiscal-connector-configuration)    |   The feature extends the fiscal integration framework by adding an option to disable fiscal registration for selected POS registers in a fiscal registration-enabled store. Store associates will be able to use the registers for non-sales operations (such as inventory management operations), and to create sales that can then be completed on fiscal registration-enabled registers. For more information, see [Set up registers with fiscal registration restrictions](../localizations/setting-up-fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#set-up-registers-with-fiscal-registration-restrictions). | Feature management<p>*Fiscal Registration State of POS Registers* |

### Removed and deprecated features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) topic describes features that have been removed or deprecated for Commerce.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
