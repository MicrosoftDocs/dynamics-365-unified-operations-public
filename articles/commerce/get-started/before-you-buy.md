[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

New to Dynamics 365 Commerce? We've put together some guidance to help you, whether you're still evaluating or ready to make a purchase.

## Step 1: Try out Commerce free for 30 days

You can try Commerce for 30 days through a simple email sign-up process. The trial version includes "Getting started" task guides that provide step-by-step instructions that allow you to view specific scenarios in action. The product is available to explore and work through scenarios, but it cannot be customized. Demo data is included to help you better understand the product and to make the experience more meaningful. A reminder email will be sent 3 days prior to the trial expiration. For more details, go to [www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/retail](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/retail).

## Step 2: Buy and manage a subscription

To explore subscription options, go to the [Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/pricing) pricing page. This page includes several different plans to fit your organization's needs.

There are a couple ways to buy a subscription of Commerce:

- Buy through a partner and use volume licensing.
- Buy through a Cloud Solution Provider.

### Buy through volume licensing

If your organization has 250 or more Dynamics 365 users, you may be interested in a [Volume licensing agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy.aspx).

In volume licensing, Commerce is available through:

- Enterprise Agreement
- Enterprise Agreement Subscription
- Enrollment for Education Solutions (under the Campus and School Agreement)
- Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA)

### Buy through a Cloud Solution Provider

A Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider can work closely with you to understand the needs of your business or organization. Use the [Microsoft Partner Center portal](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/partner/home) to find a partner to fit your needs.

### Choose your support option

Microsoft provides flexible, industry-leading support, services, and resources that enable users to quickly address technical issues and maximize return on your Dynamics 365 investment. Choose a plan that best meets your business requirements.
