### Removed and deprecated features

The [Removed or deprecated features](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) article describes features that are removed or deprecated for finance and operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn'tin active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice is announced in the [Removed or deprecated features](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) article 12 months before the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time is less than 12 months. Typically, these breaking changes are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
