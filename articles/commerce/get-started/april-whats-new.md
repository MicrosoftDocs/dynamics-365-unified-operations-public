This topic describes features that are new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Retail. 

To learn about the features in Finance and Operations, see [What's new or changed in Finance and Operations version 10.0 (April 2019)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/whats-new-changed-10).

## Restrict payment methods for returns without a receipt

This feature allows for certain payment types to be restricted for refund if the returns are made without a receipt using Retail.

For more information, see [Restrict payment methods for returns without a receipt](../../retail/payment-methods-restrictions.md).

## Omni-channel advanced auto charges

With the advanced auto-charges features in Retail, orders created in any supported Retail channel (point of sale (POS), call center, and online), can take advantage of the auto charges configurations defined in Dynamics 365 for both header and line-level related charges.

For more information, see [Omni-channel advanced auto charges](../../retail/omni-auto-charges.md).

## Retail price reports

With this new functionality, store managers can create reports detailing recent or upcoming price changes.

For more information, see [Retail price reports](../../retail/price-report.md).

## Return items across multiple customer orders and invoices

This functionality enables returns across multiple customer orders and invoices in Retail.

For more information, see [Return items across multiple customer orders and invoices](../../retail/multireturn.md).

## Loyalty changes

Functionality has been added to enhance the loyalty features in Retail.

For more information, see [Loyalty overview](../../retail/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md).

## Fiscal printer integration sample for Poland

Retail now contains a sample of the integration of POS with fiscal printers for Poland. The sample is a part of the Retail SDK. Implementation partners may extend the integration functionality to cover all required retail scenarios or build integration with other fiscal printer models based on the samples.
