This topic explains how to create and select page layouts in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Create layouts for an existing page

> [!NOTE]
> You can create layouts for an existing page only if that page has at least two modules under the main slot.

To create layouts for an existing page, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Pages**, and find the existing page in the list. Use the search feature as you require.
1. Select the page, check it out, and then select it to open it. Make a note of the module order.
1. Select **Save as New Layout**.
1. Enter a name for the layout, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **Convert to Embedded Layout**.
1. Change the order of the modules as you require, and make a note of the new order.
1. Select **Save as New Layout**.
1. Enter a name for the layout, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **Change Layout**, select the first layout that you created, and then select **OK**. Make a note of the module order. Change it so that it matches the module order that was saved with the layout.

## Select a different layout for an existing page

> [!NOTE]
> You can select a different layout for an existing page only if the template that was used to create that page has more than one layout.

To select a different layout for an existing page, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Pages**, and find the existing page in the list. Use the search feature as you require.
1. Select the page, check it out, and then select it to open it.
