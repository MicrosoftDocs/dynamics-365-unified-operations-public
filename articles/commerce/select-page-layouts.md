This topic explains how to create and select page layouts in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Create layouts for an existing page

> You can create layouts for an existing page only if that page has at least two modules under the main slot.

To create layouts for an existing page, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Pages**, and find the existing page in the list. Use the search feature as you require.
1. Select the page, select **Edit** to check it out, and then select the page name to open it. Make a note of the module order.
1. Select **Save as New Layout**.
1. Enter a name for the layout, and then select **OK**.

1. Select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it. 

## Select a different layout for an existing page
