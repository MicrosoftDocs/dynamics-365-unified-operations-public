# Verify page content accessibility

This article describes how to verify the accessibility of page content in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

When editing site pages, you should make sure the content is accessible to everyone on the web. You can easily check for common accessibility issues by installing the [Microsoft Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) browser plug-in. This tool checks your page content against the latest [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) guidelines. You can use the Accessibility Insights toolset to locally check preview and published content URLs from your browser.

> [!NOTE]
> The integrated version of Accessibility Insights (the **Accessibility Check** button on the site builder **Pages** command bar) has been deprecated within site builder. To achieve the same accessibility check functionality, install the Accessibility Insights browser plug-in mentioned above.
