They are then uploaded to your site, where they become available for selection.</p> |
| Module property | <p>**Definition:** Module properties are specific settings that are defined by the module. They can be edited in the e-Commerce authoring tools. For example, module properties are used to set the heading and background image of a banner module.</p><p>**Where it's configured:** Module properties are selected and configured in the property pane that appears in the authoring environments (editors) for templates, layouts, pages, fragments, and app settings.</p> |
| [Template](templates-layouts-overview.md) | <p>**Definition:** Templates define the module combinations and options that should be used for a category of pages (for example, marketing pages, category pages, and product pages).</p><p>**Where it's selected:** Templates can be selected during page or layout creation workflows.</p><p>**Where it's edited:** Templates are authored in the template editor. No code is required to create or modify them.</p> |
| [Layout](templates-layouts-overview.md) | <p>**Definition:** Layouts define the final selection and arrangement of modules from the parent template's set of options. A layout can be configured for a single page (*custom layout*), or it can be shared by multiple pages (*preset layout*).</p><p>**Where it's selected:** Layouts can be selected during new page creation or when a different layout is required for an existing page.</p><p>**Where it's edited:** Layouts are authored in the layout editor. No code is required to create or modify them.</p> |
| Page instance | <p>**Definition:** Page instances define the final, page-specific localized content for a single page. This content is derived from the values of module properties.</p><p>**Where it's selected:** Pages are selected when URLs are assigned.</p><p>**Where it's edited:** Pages are edited in the page editor. No code is required to create or modify them.</p> |
| [Theme](select-site-theme.md) | <p>**Definition:** Themes define the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), and determine the look and feel of the modules that are rendered on a page.</p><p>**Where it's selected:** After a theme is uploaded to your site by using Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), it can be selected as a property of the page container module.</p><p>**Where it's edited:** Themes are currently created and edited by using the SDK. They are then uploaded to your site by using LCS.</p> |
| [Fragment](work-with-fragments.md) | <p>**Definition:** Fragments are fully configured modules that have localized content that can be reused and centrally updated across multiple pages. For example, a fragment that is created from a header module can be used in all templates and on all pages across your site, and centrally updated in one place.</p><p>**Where it's selected:** Fragments can be selected wherever modules can be selected. They can be substituted for a module to help increase efficiency through reusable and centralized authoring.</p><p>**Where it's edited:** Fragments are edited in the fragment editor.
