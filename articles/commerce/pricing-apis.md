# Commerce pricing APIs

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes various pricing APIs that are provided by the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce pricing engine.

The Dynamics 365 Commerce pricing engine provides the following Retail Server APIs that can be consumed by external applications to support various pricing scenarios:

- **GetActivePrices** – This API gets a product's calculated price, including simple discounts.
- **CalculateSalesDocument** – This API calculates prices and discounts for products at given quantities if they are bought together.
- **GetAvailablePromotions** – This API gets applicable discounts for products in the cart. 
- **AddCoupons** – This API adds coupons to a cart.
- **RemoveCoupons** – This API removes coupons from a cart.

For more information about how to consume Retail Server APIs in external applications, see [Consume Retail Server APIs in external applications](dev-itpro/consume-retail-server-api.md).

## GetActivePrices

The *GetActivePrices* API was introduced in the Commerce version 10.0.4 release. This API gets a product's calculated price, including simple discounts. It doesn't calculate multiline discounts, and it assumes that each product in an API request has a quantity of 1. This API can also take a list of products as input and query the price of individual products in bulk.

The *GetActivePrices* API supports the **Employee**, **Customer**, **Anonymous**, and **Application** Commerce roles.

The main use case for the *GetActivePrices* API is the product details page (PDP), where retailers show the best price for a product, including any effective discounts.

The following table shows the input parameters for the *GetActivePrices* API.

    ]
}

## CalculateSalesDocument

The *CalculateSalesDocument* API was introduced in the Commerce version 10.0.25 release. This API calculates prices and discounts for products at given quantities if they are bought together in an order. The pricing calculation behind the *CalculateSalesDocument* API considers both single-line discounts and multi-lines discounts.

The main use case for the *CalculateSalesDocument* API is the pricing calculation in scenarios where full cart context doesn't persist (such as sales quotations). Scenarios in point of sale (POS) and Commerce e-commerce can also benefit from this use case. A lower total price when cart items are calculated as a set (for example, for discrete bundles, linked or recommended products, or products that have already been added to the cart) might persuade customers to add products to the cart.

The data model for both the request and the response of the *CalculateSalesDocument* API is **Cart**. However, in the context of this API, the data model is named **SalesDocument**. Because most of the properties are optional, and only a few of them affect the pricing calculation, only pricing-related fields are shown in the following table. We don't recommend that any other fields be involved in the API request.

The scope of the *CalculateSalesDocument* API is just the calculation of prices and discounts. Taxes and charges aren't involved.

The following table shows the input parameters inside the object that is named **salesDocument**.

| Name             | Sub-name | Type | Required/Optional | Description |
|------------------|----------|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Id               | | string | Required | The identifier of the sales document. |
| CartLines        | | IList\<CartLine\> | Optional | The list of lines to calculate prices and discounts for. |
|                  | ProductId | long | Required in the scope of CartLine | The product record ID. |
|                  | ItemId | string | Optional | The item identifier. If a value is provided, it must match the value of the **ProductId** parameter. |
|                  | InventoryDimensionId | string | Optional | The inventory dimension identifier. If a value is provided, the combination of **ItemId** and **InventoryDimensionId** values must match the value of the **ProductId** parameter. |
|                  | Quantity | decimal | Required in the scope of CartLine | The quantity of the product. |
|                  | UnitOfMeasureSymbol | string | Optional | The unit of the product. By default, if a value isn't provided, the API uses the sale unit of the product. |
| CustomerId       | | string | Optional | The customer account number. |
| LoyaltyCardId    | | string | Optional | The loyalty card identifier. Any customer account that is associated with the loyalty card must match the value of the **CustomerId** parameter (if it's provided). The loyalty card won't be considered if it isn't found or its status is **Blocked**. |
| AffiliationLines | | IList\<AffiliationLoyaltyTier\> | Optional | Affiliation loyalty tier lines. If **CustomerId** and/or **LoyaltyCardId** values are provided, the corresponding affiliation loyalty tier lines will be merged with lines that are provided in the **AffiliationLines** value. |
|                  | AffiliationId | long | Required in the scope of AffiliationLoyaltyTier | The affiliation record ID. |
|                  | LoyaltyTierId | long | Required in the scope of AffiliationLoyaltyTier | The loyalty tier record ID. |
|                  | AffiliationTypeValue | int | Required in the scope of AffiliationLoyaltyTier | A value that indicates whether the affiliation line is of the **General** type (**0**) or the **Loyalty** type (**1**). If this parameter is set to **0**, the API takes the **AffiliationId** value as the identifier and ignores the **LoyaltyTierId** value. If it's set to **1**, the API takes the **LoyaltyTierId** value as the identifier and ignores the **AffiliationId** value. |
|                  | ReasonCodeLines | Collection\<ReasonCodeLine\> | Required in the scope of AffiliationLoyaltyTier | Reason code lines. This parameter has no effect on the pricing calculation but is required as part of the **AffiliationLoyaltyTier** object. |
|                  | CustomerId | string | Required in the scope of AffiliationLoyaltyTier | The customer account number. |
| Coupons          | | IList\<Coupon\> | Optional | Coupons that aren't applicable (inactive, expired, or not found) won't be considered in the pricing calculation. |
|                  | Code | string | Required in the scope of Coupon | The coupon code. |
|                  | CodeId | string | Optional | The coupon code identifier. If a value is provided, it must match the value of the **Code** parameter. |
|                  | DiscountOfferId | string | Optional | The discount identifier. If a value is provided, it must match the value of the **Code** parameter. |

**Sample request body**

{
    "salesDocument": 
    {
        "Id": "CalculateSalesDocument",
        "CartLines": 
        [
            {
                "ProductId": 68719491408,
                "ItemId": "91003",
                "InventoryDimensionId": "",
                "Quantity": 1,

            },
            {
                "ProductId": 68719493014,
                "Quantity": 2,
                "UnitOfMeasureSymbol": "ea"
            }
        ],
        "CustomerId": "3003",
        "AffiliationLines": 
        [
            {
                "AffiliationId": 68719476742,
                "LoyaltyTierId": 0,
                "AffiliationTypeValue": 0,
                "ReasonCodeLines": [],
                "CustomerId": null
            }
        ],
        "LoyaltyCardId": "55103",
        "Coupons": 
        [
            {
                "CodeId": "CODE-0005",
                "Code": "CPN0004",
                "DiscountOfferId": "ST100077"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The whole cart object is returned as the response body. To check prices and discounts, you should focus on the fields in the following table.

| Name           | Sub-name | Type | Description |
|----------------|----------|------|--------------|
| NetPrice       | | decimal | The net price of the whole sales document before discounts are applied. |
