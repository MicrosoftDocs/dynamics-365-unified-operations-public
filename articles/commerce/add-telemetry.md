# Add script code to site pages to support telemetry

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to add client-side script code to your site pages to support the collection of client-side telemetry.

## Overview

Web analytics are an essential tool when you want to understand how your customers interact with your site and make decisions that will help optimize the experience for maximum conversion. Many web analytics packages are available to help you achieve these goals, such as Google Analytics, Clicky, Moz Analytics, and KISSMetrics. Most web analytics packages require that you add client-side script code in the **\<head\>** element of the HTML for all pages of your site.

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions in this topic also apply to other custom client-side functionality that Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce doesn't natively offer.

## Create a reusable page fragment for your script code

A page fragment allows you to reuse inline or external script code across all pages on your site, regardless of the template they use.

### Create a reusable page fragment for your inline script code

To create a reusable page fragment for your inline script code in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Page Fragments**, and then select **New**.
1. In the **New Page Fragment** dialog box, select **Inline script**.
1. Under **Page Fragment Name**, enter a name for the fragment, and then select **OK**.
1. Under the page fragment that you created, select the **Default inline script** module.
1. In the property pane on the right, under **Inline script**, enter your client-side script. Then configure other options as you require.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Finish editing**.
1. Select **Publish**.

### Create a reusable page fragment for your external script code

To create a reusable page fragment for your external script code in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Page Fragments**, and then select **New**.
1. In the **New Page Fragment** dialog box, select **External script**.
1. Under **Page Fragment Name**, enter a name for the fragment, and then select **OK**.
1. Under the page fragment that you created, select the **Default external script** module.
1. In the property pane on the right, under **Script source**, add an external or relative URL for the external script source. Then configure other options as you require.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Finish editing**.
1. Select **Publish**.

## Add a page fragment that includes script code to a template

To add a page fragment that includes script code to a template in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Templates**, and open the template for the pages that you want to add your script code to.
1. In the left pane, expand the template hierarchy to show the **HTML Head** slot.
1. In the **HTML Head** slot, select the ellipsis button (**...**), and then select **Add Page Fragment**.
1. Select the fragment that you created for your script code.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Finish editing**.
1. Select **Publish**.

## Add an external script or inline script directly to a template

If you want to insert an inline or external script directly into a set of pages that are controlled by a single template, you don't have to create a page fragment first.
