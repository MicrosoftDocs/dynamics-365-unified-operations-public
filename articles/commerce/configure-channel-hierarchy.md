This topic describes how to configure a channel to use a channel navigation hierarchy in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Channel navigation hierarchies organize products into categories so that the products can be browsed on an e-Commerce site or at points of sale (POS). Retail and online channels must be configured with channel navigation hierarchies.

## Configure the channel

To configure a channel to use a channel navigation hierarchy, follow these steps.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules \> Retail and commerce \> Channel setup \> Channel categories and product attributes**.
1. Select the channel to configure.
1. On the action pane, select **Set attribute metadata**.
1. In the **Category hierarchy** drop-down list, select the appropriate channel navigation hierarchy.
1. On the action pane, select **Save**.
1. Under **Attribute group**, add any attribute groups that will be global attributes for all nodes.

## Set attribute metadata

Setting the attribute metadata will allow configuration of attributes on each node.

To set attribute metadata, follow these steps.

1. On the action pane, select **Set attribute metadata**.
1. For each node select **Channel product attributes**.
1. Set **Show attribute on channel** to **Yes** and **Can be refined** to **Yes**, to enable refiners on that channel.
1. After configuring each node as desired, on the **Action pane**, select the **Save** button to save.
1. Select the **X** in the top right corner to exit this screen back to the **Channel categories and product attributes** page.

The following image shows an example set of channel product attributes configured on a channel category node.

To publish changes, follow these steps.

1. On the action pane, select **Publish channel updates**.
1. In the **Publish channel updates** pane, select **OK**.
