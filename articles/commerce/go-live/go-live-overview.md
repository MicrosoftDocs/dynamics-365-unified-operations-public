## Improve performance

While you're completing the go-live or upgrade process, take the opportunity to make performance improvements.

### Optimize images

Image downloads often affect website performance. You can help improve website performance by reducing the size of images and optimizing your use of images in Commerce. For more information, see [Optimize images](performance-optimize-images.md).

### Reduce JavaScript by excluding unused modules

You can help improve website performance by excluding unused JavaScript modules in Commerce. For more information, see [Reduce JavaScript by excluding unused modules](performance-reduce-javascript.md).

### Add or update robots.txt

Unexpected or undirected crawling of your site by search engines can result in a high volume of "404 Page Not Found" errors. These errors can lead to performance problems when the site responds to the many requests for pages that don't exist. To help fix this problem, always upload a valid robots.txt file to guide conforming crawlers to only look for relevant pages on your site. For more information, see [Add or update a robots.txt file](add-robots-txt.md).
