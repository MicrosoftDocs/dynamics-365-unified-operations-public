# Go-live and update recommendations overview

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the tasks that you should complete to help yourself go live with or update your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce implementation project. It provides links to content that will help you configure your system so that it works smoothly and effectively.

> [!NOTE]
> The list of articles will grow over time. It isn't an exhaustive list of all possible items that should be considered during your release.

Before you begin, download a copy of the [current go-live checklist](https://aka.ms/d365fogolivechecklist).

## Improve performance

While you're completing the go-live or upgrade process, you can take the opportunity to make performance improvements.

### Optimize images

Website performance is often affected by image downloads. You can help improve website performance by reducing the size of images and optimizing your use of images in Commerce. For more information, see [Optimize images](performance-optimize-images.md).

### Reduce JavaScript by excluding unused modules

You can help improve website performance by excluding unused JavaScript modules in Commerce. For more information, see [Reduce JavaScript by excluding unused modules](performance-reduce-javascript.md).

### Add or update robots.txt

Unexpected or undirected crawling of your site by search engines can result in a high volume of "404 Page Not Found" errors. These errors can lead to performance issues when the site responds to the many requests for pages that don't exist. To help fix this problem, you should always upload a valid robots.txt file to guide conforming crawlers to only look for relevant pages on your site. For more information, see [Add or update a robots.txt file](add-robots-txt.md).
