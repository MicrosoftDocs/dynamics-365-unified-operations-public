# Select a site theme

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to set or change your site's theme in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

A site's layout and style (for example, fonts, sizes, and colors) are defined by the theme that you select and apply to the site. A developer at your company creates and deploys a theme. For an overview of themes, see [Theming overview](e-commerce-extensibility/theming.md). For more information about how to create and deploy themes, see [Create a new theme](e-commerce-extensibility/create-theme.md).

By default, when you first create a site, it uses a theme named **Fabrikam**. The Commerce module library provides this default theme. After you deploy more themes for your site, you can configure the site to use one of them instead.

## Select the site theme

To select the theme that you apply to your site, follow these steps:

1. In Commerce site builder, go to your site.
1. Go to **Site settings** \> **Extensions**.
1. On the **Configuration** tab, under **Theme**, select a theme in the drop-down menu.
1. To apply the selected theme to your site, select **Save and publish**.

> [!NOTE]
> The theme that you select is published to your site as soon as you select **Save and publish** on the **Extensions** page. To preview a theme on your site before you apply it, use your development or sandbox environment.
