[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to assess sales performance by product in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

You can analyze profitability for the top 10 products by using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

As part of Commerce, you can also analyze profitability for the top products (10 to 100) across different levels of the organization hierarchy, based on one of the following criteria:

- Sales amount
- Quantity
- Gross profit margin
- Margin percentage

For this assessment, use the out-of-box **Top products** report. You can open it from any of the following locations:

- **Store management > Retail and Commerce > Channels > Store management > Reports > Top products report**
- **Category and product management > Retail and Commerce > Channels > Store management > Reports > Top products report**
- **Inquiries and reports > Retail and Commerce > Inquiries and reports > Sales reports > Top products report**
