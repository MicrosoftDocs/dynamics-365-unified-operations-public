# Video player module

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic covers video player modules and describes how to add them to site pages in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The video player module is used to support video playback. It can be added to any page, provided that video content is uploaded to and available in the content management system (CMS). The video player module supports the .mp4 media type.

## Video player module

The video player module can be used to showcase videos on an e-Commerce site. It supports all playback capabilities, such as play, pause, full-size mode, audio descriptions, and closed captions. The video player module also supports customization of closed captions to meet Microsoft accessibility standards. For example, you can customize the font size and background color.

The video player module also supports secondary audio tracks. When a video is uploaded to the CMS, a secondary audio track can also be uploaded. The video player module can then play the secondary audio track if a user selects it.

### Examples of video player modules in e-Commerce

- Instructional videos on product details pages or marketing pages
- Promotional videos or videos about policies on any marketing page
- Marketing videos that highlight product features on product details pages or marketing pages

The following image shows an example of a video player module on a home page.

### Video player module properties

| Property name         | Value                               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Heading               | Heading text and heading tag (**H1**, **H2**, **H3**, **H4**, **H5**, or **H6**) | By default, the **H2** heading tag is used for the heading, but the tag can be changed to meet accessibility requirements. |
| Rich text             | Paragraph text | The module supports paragraph text in rich text format. Some basic rich text capabilities are supported, such as hyperlinks, and bold, underlined, and italic text. Some of these capabilities can be overridden by the page theme that is applied to the module. |
| Link                  | Link text, link URL, Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) label, and **Open link in new tab** selector | The module supports one or more "call to action" links. If a link is added, link text, a URL, and an ARIA label are required. ARIA labels should be descriptive, to meet accessibility requirements. Links can be configured so that they are opened on a new tab. |
| Sub text              | Heading, text, or links | Additional context for the video player module can be added, such as an author or designer name, or links to personal blogs. |
| Auto play             | **True** or **False**               | When the value is set to **True**, the video is automatically played. |
| Mute                  | **True** or **False**               | When the value is set to **True**, the audio is muted. For this player, the default value is **False**. In the Chrome browser, autoplay videos are muted by default, and the audio is played only if the user manually plays the video. |
| Loop                  | **True** or **False**               | When the value is set to **True**, the video is repeated in a loop. |
| Media                 | Video file path and name | The video file that is played in the video player. |
| Play fullscreen       | **True** or **False**               | When the value is set to **True**, the video is played in full-screen mode. |
| Play pause trigger    | **True** or **False**               | When the value is set to **True**, a play/pause button is shown on the video. |
| Video player controls | **True** or **False**               | When the value is set to **True**, all video player controls are shown. These controls include play and pause buttons, a progress indicator, and closed caption options. |
| Hide poster image     | **True** or **False**               | A video can have a poster frame. When the value of this property is set to **True**, the poster frame is hidden. |
| Mask level            | A number from **0** through **100** | The mask that is applied to the video for styling. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Heading**, **Rich text**, **Link**, and **Sub text** properties are available as of the Dynamics 365 Commerce version 10.0.20 release.
