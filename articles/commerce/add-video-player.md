This topic covers video player modules and describes how to add them to site pages in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Video player modules are used to support video playback. Two video player modules are provided in the store starter kit: the ambient video player module and the video player module. Both players support the .mp4 media type.

## Ambient video player module

The ambient video player module supports short informational videos. It should be used for videos that are less than five seconds long. This player supports limited video playback capabilities, such as play and pause.

### Examples of ambient video player modules in e-Commerce

- Short informational videos that highlight new products on the home page
- Short informational videos that highlight product features on a product details page

### Ambient video player module properties

| Property name     | Value                 | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Autoplay          | **True** or **False** | When the value is set to **True**, the video is automatically played. |
| Mute              | **True** or **False** | When the value is set to **True**, the audio is muted. For this player, the default value is **True**. In the Google Chrome browser, autoplay videos are muted by default, and the audio is played only if the user manually plays the video. |
| Loop              | **True** or **False** | When the value is set to **True**, the video is repeated in a loop. |
| Media             |  Video file path and name | The video file that is played by the video player. |
| Playback controls | **True** or **False** | When the value is set to **True**, a play/pause button is shown on the video. If the value is set to **False**, the play/pause button isn't shown, but users can still pause and resume the video by using the keyboard. |

## Video player module

The video player module can be used to showcase videos on an e-Commerce site. It supports all playback capabilities, such as play, pause, full-size mode, and closed captions. The video player module also supports customization of closed captions to meet Microsoft accessibility standards. For example, you can customize the font size and background color.

The video player module also supports secondary audio tracks. When a video is uploaded, a secondary audio track can also be uploaded. The video player module can then play the secondary audio track if a user selects it.

### Examples of video player modules in e-Commerce

- Instructional videos on product details pages or marketing pages
- Promotional videos or videos about policies on any marketing page
- Marketing videos that highlight product features on product details pages or marketing pages
