# Convert asynchronous customers to synchronous customers

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to convert asynchronous customers to synchronous customers in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

To convert asynchronous customers to synchronous customers, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, run the **P-job** to send the asynchronous customers to Commerce headquarters.
1. Run the **Synchronize customers and business partners from async mode** job to create customer account IDs. (This job was formerly named **Synchronize customers and business partners from async mode**.)
1. Run the **1010** job to sync the new customer account IDs to the channels.

If an order references an asynchronous customer or address that hasn't yet been synced to Commerce headquarters, the customer or address will be synced as part of the **Synchronize orders** batch job. If a cash-and-carry transaction references an asynchronous customer or address, the customer or address will be synced before end-of-day (EOD) posting.
