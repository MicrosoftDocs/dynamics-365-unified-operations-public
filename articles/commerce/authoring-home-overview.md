# Site builder authoring page overview

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides an overview of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder authoring page.

Websites can be created to support various business needs. They can represent a whole business, offer a single channel of the business, or target a specific audience or segment of an audience. For example, a clothing manufacturer might have a website that showcases all the brands that it owns. The same clothing manufacturer might then have a separate website for each of those brands, and also a set of websites that feature luxury fashion, outdoor fashion, and children's fashion.

Dynamics 365 Commerce supports the creation and management of multiple websites, and each website can have its own appearance and content. The site builder authoring page serves as a common access point for these websites. You can use it to sign in to and out of the system, and to create new websites.

Currently, the site builder authoring page consists of the following sections.

- **Top bar** – The top bar appears at the top of the authoring page. It provides easy access to Commerce tools, notifications, support links, and user sign-in.
- **Command bar** – The command bar appears below the top bar. It can be used to create new websites.
- **Site list** – The site list fills all the space below the command bar. It provides a comprehensive list of websites and the domains that are associated with them.

The following illustration shows the authoring page.

## Use the Home button to select a tool

The **Home** button is in the upper-left corner of the authoring page. It provides easy access to other Commerce tools. When you select this button, a menu of the tools that you can use is opened. When you select a tool, the menu is closed, and the selected tool is loaded in the browser.

## View and clear notifications

The **Notifications** button is one of the buttons in the upper-right corner of the authoring page. It looks like a bell. By selecting this button, you can view all the notifications sent to you.

Notifications are used throughout site builder to inform you when actions are completed. For example, a notification might state, "Your page has been published" to inform you that a publish action was successful.

Notifications can also inform you about errors that were encountered while an action was being performed. The information in the message can help you resolve the error. To view an error notification message, select the notification. 

You can clear notifications from the notification menu by selecting **Remove** at the bottom of the notification message. To clear notifications in bulk, select **Remove all** at the bottom of the notification menu.

## Get help with site builder

The **Help** button is another button in the upper-right corner of the authoring page. It looks like a question mark. When you select this button, a menu of the following predefined options is opened:

- **Documentation** – If you select this option, the documentation for creating a new website is opened on a new browser tab.
- **Community** – Select this option to open the Commerce forum where you get help from experts and peers, leave feedback about site builder, or request support.
- **Privacy Statement** – If you select this option, the Microsoft Privacy Statement is opened on a new browser tab.
- **About** – Select this option to open a message box that contains information about site builder and the version that you're currently using.

## Sign in to and out of site builder

The **My account** button is another button in the upper-right corner of the authoring page. It looks like a colored circle. By selecting this button, you can see which account you used to sign in, and you can also sign out of that account as you require.

If you previously enabled geo redirection, a list of countries or regions is assigned to each locale. Optionally select **Edit** to add or remove locales, countries, or regions from each channel as needed. Then select **Add locales**.
1. Select **Next**.
