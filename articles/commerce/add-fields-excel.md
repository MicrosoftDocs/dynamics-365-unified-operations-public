[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to add fields to a Microsoft Excel workbook so that you can edit retail transactions in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

When you generate an Excel file so that you can edit retail transactions, the file is filled with some default fields. If a field that you must update isn't visible by default in the generated Excel file, you can add it.

## Add fields to a worksheet in an Excel workbook

To add fields to an Excel workbook so that you can edit retail transactions, follow these steps:

1. Download and open the Excel file from the **Statements** page, the **Retail transactions** page, or the **Transaction validation failures** tile in the **Store financials** workspace.
1. Select **Design**.
1. Select the pencil symbol for the desired table. In the list of available fields, find and select the field that you want to add.
1. Select **Add**, and then select **Update**. You can reorder fields.
1. After the update is completed, select **Refresh** to fetch the data for the new column.

The new field and data for it are now available for editing in Excel.
