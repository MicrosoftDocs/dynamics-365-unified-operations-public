This topic provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce preview environment.

**Can I transfer my invitation for the Commerce preview environment to another tenant?**

Yes. For invitation transfers, you can use the [Commerce preview transfer form](https://aka.ms/Dynamics365CommercePreviewTransferForm).

**How long does the invitation transfer take?**

The transfer takes an average of approximately three to five business days. However, exceptions might apply.

**Does the Commerce preview environment work with Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain projects?**

No. The Commerce preview environment works only with Dynamics 365 Retail projects.

**Can we use the Commerce preview environment as an e-commerce storefront for customers that currently implement Retail?**

No. The Commerce preview environment is just the evaluation environment. If you require an environment for a customer that implements Retail, contact Microsoft.

**Can the Commerce preview environment be used to provision the e-commerce features on top of an existing application/environment that implements Retail?**

No. The Commerce preview environment is currently available only in new environments that were deployed on Retail stock keeping unit (SKU) projects that have demo data from version 10.0.6.

**What costs are involved in deploying the Commerce preview environment on Microsoft Azure via Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)?**

Retail is the only component that is hosted in your subscription. Other components such as Retail Cloud Scale Unit (RCSU) and e-Commerce will be hosted in Microsoft subscriptions. You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to estimate this cost.

**Which Azure geographies are currently supported for the Commerce preview environment?**

The Commerce preview environment can be deployed only in the North America geography.

**Is there a downloadable virtual hard disk (VHD) that has the complete OneBox virtual machine (VM) option?**

Dynamics 365 Retail Cloud Scale Unit (RCSU) and e-Commerce are completely software as a service (SaaS) and must be cloud-hosted.

**How long can the Commerce preview environment be used?**

The Commerce preview environment has a 30-day time limit from the date of provisioning e-Commerce.

**Can I extend the time limit for my Commerce preview environment?**

Yes. You can contact the support team by using the [Commerce preview extension form](https://aka.ms/Dynamics365CommercePreviewExtensionForm).

**Can we make multiple requests for a Commerce preview environment?**

We grant a quota of one Commerce preview environment for each request that is accepted. If you need more than one preview environment, contact Microsoft. For contact information, see the next section.
