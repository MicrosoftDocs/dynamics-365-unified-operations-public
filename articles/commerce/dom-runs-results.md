# Results of DOM runs

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the results of distributed order management (DOM) runs in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Fulfillment plans

If you set the fulfillment profile to **Auto apply**, the run results automatically apply to the sales order lines, and you can view the fulfillment plan separately. However, if you don't set the fulfillment profile to **Auto apply**, you can only view the run results from the fulfillment plan view.

To view all the generated fulfillment plans, follow these steps:

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Distributed order management \> Distributed order management**.
1. In the **Distributed order management** workspace, select the **Fulfillment Plans** tile.
1. Select the ID of the relevant order fulfillment plan to view the fulfillment plan.

The order details section of the fulfillment plan shows the original sales order lines that were part of the run. Besides the standard sales order line fields, the order details section also includes the following three DOM-related fields:

- **Fulfillment type** – Shows whether the sales order line is fully brokered, partially brokered, or not brokered at all to a location.
- **Split** – Shows whether one sales order line is split and brokered to different locations.
- **Number of fulfillment locations** – Shows how many fulfillment lines were created for one sales order line (based on the number of locations that the original sales order line was brokered to).

The order fulfillment details section shows the assignment of the original sales order lines to different locations, together with their quantities.

## Order line statuses

To open an order line, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Customers \> All sales orders**.

Set the **DOM status** field on the **General** tab of the sales order line to one of the following values:

- **Not processed** – The order line was never brokered.
- **Successful** – The order line is successfully brokered and assigned to a location.
- **Exception** – The order line is brokered but can't be assigned to a location. Exceptions have multiple subtypes that you can view from the DOM workspace:
  - **No quantity available** – There's no available inventory to assign the order to in the locations.
  - **Maximum rejections** – The order line reached the maximum threshold for rejections.
  - **Data modification conflict** – The sales order line was changed since the order was brokered, so the fulfillment plan can't be applied to the order.
  - **Order line specific exception** – There are multiple exceptions on the order line.


To view the DOM run logs for a sales order line, select **Sales order line**, and then, under **DOM**, select **View DOM Logs**. The DOM logs show all the events and logs generated by the DOM run. The logs can help you understand why a specific location was assigned to the order line, and what rules and constraints were considered as a part of the assignment. You can also find DOM logs on the **Manage** tab, at the level of the sales order header.

## Get results of DOM runs in an interactive mode

Although you run DOM with batch jobs, you can run DOM in an interactive mode during the sales order entry. For this functionality to work, an existing, active fulfillment profile must match the sales origin and delivery mode on the sales line.

To run DOM in interactive mode, follow these steps:

1. While you're entering an order line in headquarters, after you specify the product and quantity, select **Update line**.
1. Under **DOM**, select **Suggest fulfillment location**. A list of locations sorted by distance appears that is based on DOM rules that can fulfill the quantity on the order line. 
1. Select a location to set the relevant site and warehouse on the sales order line.
