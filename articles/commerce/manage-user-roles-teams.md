# Manage user roles in Microsoft Teams

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to manage Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce user roles in Microsoft Teams.

As you create a team for each store or channel in Teams, a group membership that corresponds to the team is created (for example, `HOUSTON_D365@<YourTenantAzureADDomain>.com`). All the store workers under a team group membership are assigned one of two user roles: **Owner** or **Member**. Store employees who have the **Owner** user role can perform operations such as adding a private channel, and adding or deleting members. Typically, store managers have the **Owner** user role.

The following illustration shows an example of a list of team members and their user roles in the Microsoft Teams admin center.
