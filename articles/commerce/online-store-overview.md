# Online store overview

This topic introduces the concept of an online store and explains how online stores are used in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. It also provides a link to more information about online stores and information about how to set up an online store.

Before you can build your site in Dynamics 365 Commerce, at least one online store must be set up. In Dynamics 365 Commerce, you use an online store to establish the products, pricing, languages, payment methods, delivery modes, fulfillment centers, and other aspects of the online experience that should be available to your customers.

Only one online store has to be set up before you can get started with Dynamics 365 Commerce. However, a single Dynamics 365 Commerce site can provide the online experience for multiple online stores. For example, if multiple online stores are set up to support different geographical regions, a single set of pages can be used to provide the unique experiences that are defined by each store. For more information about how to configure a site to support multiple online stores, see [Associate an online site with a channel](associate-site-online-store.md).

After an online store is set up, it can be associated with the Dynamics 365 Commerce site that will serve as your online storefront. For more information about online stores and how to set them up, see [Set up online stores](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/online-stores).
