# Product recommendations on POS

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

At its core, product recommendations are a transformative business application that span across all retail spaces to create rich, engaging, and tailored product discovery experiences. To implement this feature on POS, follow the steps on [how to add recommendations to your POS devices.](add-recommendations-control-pos-screen.md) 

For more information about product recommendations features, read the [product recommendations overview.](../commerce/product-recommendations.md) 

## Scenarios

Product recommendations are enabled for the following POS scenarios. They are available in Cloud POS or Modern POS (MPOS).

1. On the **Product details** page:

    - If a store associate visits a **Product details** page when looking at previous transactions across different channels, the recommendations service suggests additional items that are likely to be purchased together.

2. On the **Transaction** page:

    - The recommendation engine suggests items based on the entire list of items in the basket that are frequently bought together.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To display recommendations on the **Transaction** page, the retailer needs to update the screen layout in Dynamics 365 Commerce. The **Recommendations** control must be dropped onto the **Transaction** page.

## Configure Commerce to enable POS recommendations

To set up product recommendations, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your service has been updated to the **10.0.6 build.**
2. Follow the instructions on how to [enable product recommendations](../commerce/enable-product-recommendations.md) for your business.
3. Optional: To display recommendations on the transaction screen, go to **Screen Layout**, choose your screen layout, launch the **Screen layout designer**, and then drop the **recommendations** control where needed.
4. Go to **Commerce parameters**, select **Machine-learning**, select **Yes** under **Enable POS recommendations**.
5. To see recommendations on POS, run global configuration job **1110**. To reflect changes made to POS screen layout designer, run channel configuration job **1070**.

## Troubleshoot issues where you have Product recommendations already enabled

- Navigate to **Commerce Parameters** \> **Recommendation lists** \> **Disable product recommendations** and run **Global configuration job \[9999\]**. 
- If you added the **Recommendations control** to your transaction screen using the **Screen layout designer**, please remove that as well.
- If you have additional questions, check out the [Product recommendations FAQ](../commerce/faq-recommendations.md) for more information.
