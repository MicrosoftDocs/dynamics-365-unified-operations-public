# Send email receipts from Modern POS (MPOS)

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

In Modern Point of Sale (MPOS), you can send receipt emails when a transaction is tendered at the point of sale (POS).

## Prerequisite

To send email receipts, you must configure a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server.

## Set up email receipts

### Set default options for email receipts

1. Select **Retail and Commerce &gt; Headquarters setup &gt; Parameters &gt; Commerce parameters**.
2. On the **Posting** tab, on the **Email receipt** FastTab, in the **Receipt option** field, select a default option:

    - **Standard receipt** – Print receipts from the POS register.
    - **Email** – Send receipts to customers in email messages.
    - **Both** – Print receipts from the POS register, and send receipts to customers in email messages.

3. In the **Subject** field, enter the text that should appear by default on the subject line of a receipt that is sent as an email message.

### Set email receipt options for a customer

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce &gt; Customers &gt; All customers**.
2. On the **All customers** list page, select a customer, and then select **Edit**.
3. On the customer details page, on the **Commerce** FastTab, in the **Receipt option** field, select an option:

    - **Standard receipt** – The customer will receive only printed receipts. The printed receipt is generated from the POS register.
    - **Email** – The customer will receive only email receipts.
    - **Both** – The customer will receive both printed receipts and email receipts.

4. If you selected either **Email** or **Both** in the **Receipt option** field, enter the customer's email address in the **Receipt email** field.

### Set up an email receipt profile

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce &gt; Channel setup &gt; POS setup &gt; POS profiles &gt; Receipt profiles**.
2. Press **Ctrl+N** to create a receipt profile.
3. Enter values in the **Receipt profile ID** and **Description** fields.
4. On the **General** FastTab, select **Add** to add a receipt type.
5. Select **Receipt** as the receipt type, and select the receipt format to use for email receipts.

### Add an email receipt profile to the functionality profile

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce &gt; Channel setup &gt; POS setup &gt; POS profiles &gt; Functionality profiles**.
2. Select **Edit**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Receipt profile ID** field, specify an email receipt profile.

### Set up an email template for receipts

1. Go to **Organization administration &gt; Setup &gt; Email templates**.
2. Press **Ctrl+N** to create a template.
3. On the **Overview** tab, complete the following fields:

    - In the **Email ID** field, enter **EmailRecpt**.
    - In the **Email description** field, enter a description.
    - In the **Default language code** field, select the language.
    - In the **Sender name** field, specify the name that should appear as the sender of the email. Customers will see this name as the **From** name on the email.
    - In the **Sender email** field, specify a valid email address. Customers will see this email address as the **From** email address on the email.

4. In the lower grid, configure the following fields:

    - Make sure that the **Email ID** field is set to **EmailRecpt**.
    - In the **Subject** field, enter a title for the email receipts.
    - In the **Language** field, specify the language.
   -   **Email**- Insert the following string:


    ``` xml
    <pre>
    %message%
    </pre>
    ```

-   If you want to have more than just the receipt in the message, select **E-mail message** to fill out the template for the body of the email messages to be sent. The placeholder *%message%.* is used to insert the receipt from MPOS. 

    The **%message%** placeholder is the only placeholder that will be replaced when MPOS receipts are sent. If you want more placeholder options, you must create a customization on the MPOS side.

It's a best practice to put the HTML content in a text editor, such as Notepad, and save it as a .txt file before uploading. This will help to preserve receipt alignment and reduce header and footer space in the emailed receipt.

The logo and bar code from the printed receipt will not be included in the emailed receipt version. To include the logo, create a generic HTML email template and embed the placeholder. Including bar codes in the emailed receipt requires customization. 

5. Depending on the settings that you configured, you must run the appropriate distribution schedule jobs to synchronize the changes to MPOS.

    - **1010** – Customer
    - **1070** – Channel configuration
    - **1090** – Registers
    - **1110** – Global configuration

## MPOS transactions

After the changes are synchronized to the store, MPOS prompts the user for an email address for each transaction (if this feature is enabled). If an email address is already on file for the customer, that address appears in the email address prompt. If a customer hasn't been named, or if an email address hasn't been entered for a named customer, enter an email address, and then select **Send**. When the transaction is finalized, the real-time service will send the customer an email that has the receipt in the body of the message, as you configured earlier.
