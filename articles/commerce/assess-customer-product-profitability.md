# Assess customer and product profitability

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how you can use the in-memory and real-time analytics to access, explore, and gain insight about customers and product profitability from your Dynamics 365 Commerce data.

As part of Commerce, users can study profitability for the top customers (10 to 100) across different levels of the organization hierarchy, based on one of the following criteria:

- Sales amount
- Quantity
- Gross profit margin
- Margin percentage

For this assessment, use the out-of-box **Top customers** report, which you can open from any of the following locations:

- **Store management** > **Retail and Commerce** > **Channels** > **Store management** > **Reports** > **Top customers report**
- **Inquiries and reports** > **Retail and Commerce** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Sales reports** > **Top customers report**

Likewise, users can study profitability for the top products (10 to 100) across different levels of the organization hierarchy, based on one of the following criteria:

- Sales amount
- Quantity
- Gross profit margin
- Margin percentage

For this assessment, use the out-of-box **Top products** report, which you can open from any of the following locations:

- **Store management** > **Retail and Commerce** > **Channels** > **Store management** > **Reports** > **Top products report**
- **Category and product management** > **Retail and Commerce** > **Products and categories** > **Store management** > **Reports** > **Top products report**
- **Inquiries and reports** > **Retail and Commerce** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Sales reports** > **Top products report**
