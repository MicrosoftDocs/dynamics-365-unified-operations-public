# Set up an email notification profile


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to create an email notification profile in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Before creating channels, you'll want to set up a profile to ensure that email notifications can be sent out for various events, such as order creation, order shipping status, and payment failure.

For additional email configuration information, see [Configure and send email](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/configure-email).

## Create an email notification profile

To create an email notification profile, follow these steps.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules \> Retail and commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Retail Email notification profile**.
1. On the action pane, click **New**.
1. In the **Email notification profile** field, enter a name to identify the profile.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a relevant description.
1. Set the **Active** switch to **Yes**.

### Create an email template

Before an email notification can be created, you must create an organization email template which contains the senders email information and the email template.

To create an email template, follow these steps.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules \> Retail and commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Parameters \> Organization email templates**.
1. On the action pane, select **New**.
1. In the **Email ID** field, enter an ID to help identify this template.
1. In the **Sends name** field, enter the senders name.
1. In the **Email Description**, enter a meaningful description.
1. In the **Sender email**, enter the senders email address.
1. In the **General** section, fill out any optional information needed (such as the email priority).
1. Expand the **Email message content** section and select **New** to create the template content. For each content item, select the language and provide the email subject line. If the email will have a body, ensure that the **Has body** box is checked.
1. On the action pane, select **Email message** to provide an email body template.

The following image shows some example email template settings.
