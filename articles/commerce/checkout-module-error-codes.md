# Checkout module error reference codes

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the checkout module error codes that are shown in user-facing error messages in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

Dynamics 365 Commerce has introduced standardized error references that can be included in online channel checkout errors that are presented to online customers. In Commerce version 10.0.31 and later, error messages in the checkout module include error codes and don't show unnecessary information to the online customer. The error codes refer to errors that are detailed in this article.

Depending on the error that is encountered, the table in this article includes the following details:

- A description of the condition that caused the error, or additional details
- Information for consideration in the environment or payment connector configurations
- Information that can be referenced in a support case, if additional assistance is required

## Prerequisites

To enable the checkout module error reference codes listed below, in site builder for your site, go to **Site settings \> Extensions**, and in the **Cart and checkout** section, select **Enable Enhanced Online Channel Error Display Messaging**. 

## Checkout module error reference codes

Use the following table to get more details about error code references that are provided by customers or experienced in the online store. Scroll to the right to view the **Error Description** column.
