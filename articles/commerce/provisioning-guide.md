This topic explains how to provision a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce preview environment.

Before you begin, we recommend that you at least skim through this whole topic to get an idea of what the process entails and what this topic contains.

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't yet been granted access to the Dynamics 365 Commerce preview, you can request preview access from the [Commerce website](https://aka.ms/Dynamics365CommerceWebsite).

## Overview

To successfully provision your Commerce preview environment, you must create a project that has a specific product name and type. The environment and Retail Cloud Scale Unit (RCSU) also have some specific parameters that you must use when you provision e-Commerce later. The instructions in this topic describe all the required steps that you must complete and the parameters that you must use.

After you successfully provision your Commerce preview environment, you must complete a few post-provisioning steps to prepare it. Some steps are optional, depending on the aspects of the system that you want to evaluate. You can always complete the optional steps later.

For information about how to configure your Commerce preview environment after you provision it, see [Configure a Commerce preview environment](cpe-post-provisioning.md). For information about how to configure optional features for your Commerce preview environment, see [Configure optional features for a Commerce preview environment](cpe-optional-features.md).

If you have any questions about the provisioning steps, or if you encounter any issues, let Microsoft know in the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview Yammer group](https://aka.ms/Dynamics365CommercePreviewYammer).

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be in place before you can provision your Commerce preview environment:

- You have access to the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) portal.
- You are an existing Microsoft Dynamics 365 partner or customer and are able to create a Dynamics 365 Retail project.
- You've been accepted into the Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview program.
- You have the required permissions to create a project for **Prospective presales** or **Migrate, create solutions, and learn**.
- You're a member of the **Environment manager** or **Project owner** role in the project where you will provision the environment.
- You have admin access to your Microsoft Azure subscription, or you're in contact with a subscription admin who can complete the two steps that require admin permissions on your behalf.
- You have your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant ID available.
- You've created an Azure AD security group that can be used as an e-Commerce system admin group, and you have its ID available.
- You've created an Azure AD security group that can be used as a Ratings and Reviews moderator group, and you have its ID available. (This security group can be the same as the e-Commerce system admin group.)

### Find your Azure AD tenant ID

Your Azure AD tenant ID is a globally unique identifier (GUID) that resembles this example: **72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47**.

#### Find your Azure AD tenant ID by using the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Make sure that the correct directory is selected.
1. On the menu on the left, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Properties**. Your Azure AD tenant ID appears under **Directory ID**.

#### Find your Azure AD tenant ID by using OpenID Connect metadata

Create an OpenID URL by replacing **\{YOUR\_DOMAIN\}** with your domain, such as `microsoft.com`. For example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{YOUR_DOMAIN}/.well-known/openid-configuration` will become `https://login.microsoftonline.com/microsoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

1. Go to the OpenID URL that contains your domain.

    You can find you Azure AD tenant ID in multiple property values.

1. Find **authorization\_endpoint**, and extract the GUID that appears immediately after `login.microsoftonline.com/`.

### Find your Azure AD security group ID

The ID of your Azure AD security group is a GUID that resembles this example: **436ea7f5-ee6c-40c1-9f08-825c5811066a**.

This procedure assumes that you're a member of the group that you're trying to find the ID for.

1. Open the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer#).
1. Select **Sign In with Microsoft**, and sign in by using your credentials.
1. On the left, select **show more samples**.
1. In the right pane, enable **Groups**.
1. Close the right pane.
1. Select **all groups I belong to**.
1. In the **Response Preview** field, find your group. The security group ID appears under the **id** property.

## Provision your Commerce preview environment

These procedures explain how to provision a Commerce preview environment. After you successfully complete them, the Commerce preview environment will be ready for configuration. All the activities that are described here occur in the LCS portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview access is tied to the LCS account and organization that you specified in your preview application. You must use the same account to provision the Commerce preview environment. If you must use a different LCS account or tenant for the Commerce preview environment, you must provide those details to Microsoft. For contact information, see the [Commerce preview environment support](#commerce-preview-environment-support) section later in this topic.

### Grant access to e-Commerce applications

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The person who signs in must be an Azure AD tenant admin who has the Azure AD tenant ID. If this step isn't successfully completed, the remaining provisioning steps will fail.

To authorize e-Commerce applications to access your Azure subscription, follow these steps.

1. Assemble a URL in the following format:

    `https://login.windows.net/{AAD_TENANT_ID}/oauth2/authorize?client_id=fbcbf727-cd18-4422-a723-f8274075331a&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://sb.manage.commerce.dynamics.com/_commerce/Consent&response_mode=query&prompt=admin_consent&state=12345`

1. Copy and paste the URL into your browser or text editor, and replace **\{AAD\_TENANT\_ID\}** with your Azure AD tenant ID. Then open the URL.
1. In the Azure AD sign-in dialog box, sign in, and confirm that you want to grant **Dynamics 365 Commerce (Preview)** access to your subscription. You're redirected to a page that indicates whether the operation was successful.

### Confirm that preview features are available and turned on in LCS

To confirm that preview features are available and turned on in LCS, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [LCS portal](https://lcs.dynamics.com) by using the same LCS account that you used to request access to the preview.
1. On the LCS home page, scroll all the way to the right, and select the **Preview feature management** tile.
