# Provision a Dynamics 365 Commerce preview environment


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to provision a Dynamics 365 Commerce preview environment.

Before you begin, we recommend that you take a quick scan through this topic to get an idea of what the process requires.

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't yet been granted access to the Dynamics 365 Commerce preview, you can request preview access from the [Dynamics 365 Commerce website](https://aka.ms/Dynamics365CommerceWebsite).

## Overview

To successfully provision your Commerce preview environment, you must create a project that has a specific product name and type. The environment and commerce scale unit (CSU) also have some specific parameters that you must use when you provision e-Commerce later. The instructions in this topic describe all the steps required to complete provisioning and the parameters that you must use.

After you successfully provision your Commerce preview environment, you must complete a few post-provisioning steps to prepare it. Some steps are optional, depending on the aspects of the system that you want to evaluate. You can always complete the optional steps later.

For information about how to configure your Commerce preview environment after you provision it, see [Configure a Commerce preview environment](cpe-post-provisioning.md). For information about how to configure optional features for your Commerce preview environment, see [Configure optional features for a Commerce preview environment](cpe-optional-features.md).

If you have any questions about the provisioning steps, or if you encounter any issues, let Microsoft know in the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview Yammer group](https://aka.ms/Dynamics365CommercePreviewYammer).

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be in place before you can provision your Commerce preview environment:

- You have access to the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) portal.
- You are an existing Microsoft Dynamics 365 partner or customer and are able to create a Dynamics 365 Commerce project.
- You've been accepted into the Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview program.
- You have the required permissions to create a project for **Migrate, create solutions, and learn**.
- You're a member of the **Environment manager** or **Project owner** role in the project where you will provision the environment.
- You have admin access to your Microsoft Azure subscription, or you're in contact with a subscription admin who can complete the two steps that require admin permissions on your behalf.
- You have your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant ID available.
- You've created an Azure AD security group that can be used as an e-Commerce system admin group, and you have its ID available.
- You've created an Azure AD security group that can be used as a Ratings and Reviews moderator group, and you have its ID available. (This security group can be the same as the e-Commerce system admin group.)

## Provision your Commerce preview environment

These procedures explain how to provision a Commerce preview environment. After you successfully complete them, the Commerce preview environment will be ready for configuration. All the activities that are described here occur in the LCS portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview access is tied to the LCS account and organization that you specified in your Commerce preview application. You must use the same account to provision the Commerce preview environment. If you need to use a different LCS account or tenant for the Commerce preview environment, you must provide those details to Microsoft. For contact information, see the [Commerce preview environment support](#commerce-preview-environment-support) section later in this topic.

### Confirm that preview features are available and turned on in LCS

To confirm that preview features are available and turned on in LCS, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [LCS portal](https://lcs.dynamics.com) by using the same LCS account that you used to request access to the preview.
1. On the LCS home page, scroll all the way to the right, and select the **Preview feature management** tile.

### Deploy the environment

To deploy the environment, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not have to complete steps 6, 7, and/or 8, because pages that have a single option are skipped. When you're in the **Environment parameters** view, confirm that the text **Dynamics 365 Commerce - Demo (10.0.*x* with Platform update *xx*)** appears directly above the **Environment name** field. For details, see the illustration that appears after step 8.

1. On the top menu, select **Cloud-hosted environments**.
1. Select **Add** to add an environment.
1. In the **Application version** field, select the most current version. If you have a specific need to select an application version other than the most current version, do not select a version prior to **10.0.8**.

    ![Selecting application and platform versions](./media/project1.png)

If you configured multiple Azure Connectors, you can select which connector to use: **East US**, **East US 2**, **West US**, or **West US 2**. (For the best end-to-end performance, we recommend that you select **West US 2**.)

    ![Selecting the environment topology 2](./media/project3.png)

1. On the **Deploy environment** page, enter an environment name. Leave the advanced settings as they are.

    ![Deploy environment page](./media/project4.png)

1. Select **Next**.
1. On the deployment confirmation page, verify that the details are correct, and then select **Deploy**. You're returned to the **Cloud-hosted environments** view, and your environment should appear in the list.

    Your requested environment will appear as queued and then deploying. The environment workflows will take some time to be completed. Therefore, check back after approximately six to nine hours.

1. Before you continue, make sure that the status of your environment is **Deployed**.

### Initialize the commerce scale unit (CSU)

1. Turn on the **Apply extension** option.
1. In the list of extensions, select **Commerce Preview Demo Base Extension**.
1. Select **Initialize**.
1. On the deployment confirmation page, verify that the details are correct, and then select **Yes**. The **Commerce management** view displays again, where the **Commerce** tab is selected. Your CSU has been queued for provisioning.
1. Before you continue, make sure that the status of your CSU is **Success**. Initialization takes approximately two to five hours.

### Initialize e-Commerce

To initialize e-Commerce, follow these steps.

1. On the **e-Commerce** tab, review the preview consent, and then select **Setup**.
1. In the **e-Commerce tenant name** field, enter a name. However, be aware that this name will appear in some of the URLs that point to your e-Commerce instance.
