# Enable consistent delivery mode handling in e-commerce channels 

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to enable consistent delivery mode handling to address possible issues that are related to charges flows in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce e-commerce channels.

In Dynamics 365 Commerce, non-prorated header-level charges aren't applied by default in e-commerce channels. This behavior might cause one or both of the following issues in e-commerce channels:

- Non-prorated header-level charges don't appear.
- Charges for delivery modes aren't consistent between the mode of delivery selection and the checkout order summary.

To fix these issues, you must turn on the **Enable consistent delivery mode handling in channel** feature. This feature ensures that non-prorated header-level charges appear in e-commerce channels, and that sales order delivery information is handled consistently by the same request workflow.

## Turn on the Enable consistent delivery mode handling in channel feature

To enable the **Enable consistent delivery mode handling in channel** feature in Commerce headquarters, follow these steps.

1. Open the **Feature management** workspace (**System administration \> Workspaces \> Feature management**).
1. In the list of available features, search for and select **Enable consistent delivery mode handling in channel**.
1. In the right pane, select **Enable now**.
