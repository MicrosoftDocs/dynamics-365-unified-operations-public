# Enable and use cross-channel sharing

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to enable and use the cross-channel sharing feature of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder.

## Overview

Cross-channel sharing lets retailers reuse and share content among multiple channels of a site. This capability is useful when the site channels have a compatible base language, or when they have numerous content items in common.

Cross-channel sharing works by enabling a default channel that will be searched for available content when a channel-specific version of the requested content isn't found. Content that is intended to be shared among channels is created in the default channel. That content can be localized for any locale that is used on any site channel.

## When to use cross-channel sharing

Cross-channel sharing is useful when multiple channels on a single site can share content. For example, a retailer that has multiple brands and storefronts that are grouped under a single site can share some content among some or all of the storefronts. This shared content can include pages for terms and conditions, payment terms, shipment methods, and frequently asked questions (FAQ).

Cross-channel sharing also supports fragments. Therefore, a content page that contains channel-specific fragments can be created as cross-channel content. In this case, although most of the content will be shared among channels, channel-specific fragments on a cross-channel page will be rendered only when they are requested from the corresponding storefront channel.

Sites that have only one channel, or sites that have multiple channels that can't share content, won't benefit from cross-channel sharing.

## Enable cross-channel sharing

Cross-channel sharing is enabled at the site level. This operation is one-way. In other words, after cross-channel sharing is enabled, it can't be disabled.

To enable cross-channel sharing in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Site settings \> Features**.
1. Set the option for the **Cross Channel** feature to **On**.

After you enable cross-channel sharing, cross-channel information will appear in the **Channels** section at **Site settings \> Features**, as the example in the following illustration shows.

Additionally, after you enable cross-channel sharing, the **Channel** field in the upper right of Commerce site builder will include a **Cross Channel Online Store** option that you can use to manage cross-channel content, as shown in the following illustration.

## Create and use cross-channel content

You can create and use cross-channel content in multiple ways. For example, you can create cross-channel fragments, create cross-channel pages that use cross-channel and channel-specific content, and override cross-channel fragments with channel-specific versions of fragments.

### Create a cross-channel fragment

To create a cross-channel fragment in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Fragments**, and select **New** to create a new fragment.
1. In the **New fragment** dialog box, select the **Promo banner** module, and then, under **Fragment name**, enter a name (for example, **Cross-channel banner**). Then select **OK**.
1. In the property pane for the **Promo banner** module, select **Add Message**, and then select **Message**.
1. In the **Message** dialog box, under **Text**, enter **Cross-channel**, and the select **OK**. 
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

This cross-channel fragment can be used on cross-channel or channel-specific pages that are created on any site channel.

### Create a cross-channel page that uses cross-channel content

Cross-channel pages can be used on any channel of your site. Therefore, you can create a shared content page one time and make any subsequent updates in a single place. For example, a cross-channel **Terms and conditions** page that has the URL `/toc` can be shared among all the channels of a site. If the base URLs for the site channels are `www.fabrikam.com/brand1` and `www.fabrikam.com/brand2`, the same cross-channel, shared **Terms and conditions** page will be available from both site channel URLs, at `www.fabrikam.com/brand1/toc` and `www.fabrikam.com/brand2/toc`, respectively. If the **Terms and conditions** page must be updated later, you have to update only the single, shared page.

To create a cross-channel page in Commerce site builder that uses cross-channel content, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Pages**, and select **New** to create a new page.
1. In the **Choose a template** dialog box, select a template, such as **Marketing**.
1. Under **Page name**, enter a name for the page (for example, **Cross-channel page**).
1. Under **Page URL**, enter a page URL (for example, **examplepage**), and then select **OK**.
1. In the **Main** slot of the new page, select the ellipsis (**...**), and then select **Add fragment**.
1. In the **Add fragment** dialog box, select the cross-channel fragment that you created earlier that has a promo banner, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Preview** to preview the page. You should see the promo banner that says, "Cross-channel."
1. Select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

### Create a channel-specific page that uses cross-channel content

By using cross-channel content on channel-specific pages, you can create a shared content fragment one time and then use it on channel-specific pages. This "single sourcing" is useful for shared content such as terms and conditions, payment terms, or contact information.

To create a channel-specific page in Commerce site builder that uses cross-channel content, follow these steps.

1. From within a specific channel, such as **Fabrikam extended online store**, go to **Pages**, and then select **New** to create a new page.
1. In the **Choose a template** dialog box, select a template, such as **Marketing**.
1. Under **Page name**, enter a name for the page (for example, **Channel-specific page**).
1. Under **Page URL**, enter a page URL (for example, **channelspecificpage**), and then select **OK**.
1. In the **Main** slot of the new page, select the ellipsis (**...**), and then select **Add fragment**.
1. In the **Add fragment** dialog box, under **Channel**, select **Cross Channel Online Store**. The cross-channel fragment that you created earlier should appear in the list. Select it, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Preview** to preview the page. You should see the promo banner that says, "Cross-channel."
1. Select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

### Create a channel-specific version of a cross-channel page

Cross-channel sharing supports overrides of cross-channel content. For example, all but one of your site channels share the same piece of content. That one site channel requires different content. To implement the different content for it, you override the cross-channel content with channel-specific content by creating a channel-specific version of the cross-channel page.

To create a channel-specific version of a cross-channel page in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. In the **Channel** field in the upper right, select **Cross Channel Online Store**.
1. Open the cross-channel page that you created earlier.
1. In the **Channel** field in the upper right, select the channel that should have specific content. The page editor shows a message that prompts you to create a new page variant.
1. Select **Create page variant**.
1. In the **Main** slot of the page variant, select the ellipsis (**...**), and then select **Add Module**.
1. In the **Add Module** dialog box, select the **Promo banner** module, and then select **OK**.
1. In the property pane for the **Promo banner** module, select **Add Message**, and then select **Message**.
1. In the **Message** dialog box, under **Text**, enter **Channel-specific**, and the select **OK**.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Preview** to preview the page. You should see the promo banner that says, "Channel-specific."
1. Select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

Now, if you use the base URL of the channel and go to the URL of the cross-channel page on that site, you will see the channel-specific content instead of the cross-channel content.
