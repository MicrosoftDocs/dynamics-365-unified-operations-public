# Channels overview


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic presents an overview of channels in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. It includes information about the tasks that you must complete both before and after you set up each channel.

## Types of Channels

Dynamics 365 Commerce supports three different channel types: retail, call center, and online channels.

### Retail channels

Retail channels represent standard brick-and-mortar stores. Each store can have its own point of sale (POS) registers, income and expense accounts, and staff. 

### Call center channels

Call center channels represent call center order and customer management.

### Online channels

Online channels represent online e-Commerce storefronts. Once an online channel is created, a site must be created using the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Site Builder tool or other third-party e-Commerce solution.

## Channel setup basics

Channel set up is performed in the Commerce tool. Each channel can have its own payment methods, price groups, product hierarchies, assortments, and set of products. After you create a channel, you assign the products that you want it to carry and sell. Each channel type has a unique set of features that may need to be configured. For example, a retail channel needs assigned employees, registers, and customers. Once a new channel is created, it needs to be assigned to an organization hierarchy.

## Channel setup prerequisites

Before you can set up a channel, you must complete some prerequisite tasks based on the channel type. For more information, see
[Channel setup prerequisites](channels-prerequisites.md).
