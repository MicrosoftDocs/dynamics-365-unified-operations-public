# Create legal entities


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to create legal entities in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce, which must be created and configured before creating channels.

## Overview

A legal entity is an organization that has a registered or legislated legal structure. Legal entities can enter into legal contracts and are required to prepare statements that report on their performance.

A company is a type of legal entity. Currently, companies are the only kind of legal entity that you can create, and every legal entity is associated with a company ID. This association exists because some functional areas in the program use a company ID, or *DataAreaId*, in their data models. In these functional areas, companies are used as a boundary for data security. Users can access data only for the company that they are currently logged on to. 

When creating a channel, you must specify which legal entity that channel belongs to.
