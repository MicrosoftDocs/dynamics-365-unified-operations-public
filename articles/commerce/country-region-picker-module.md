# Country/region picker module

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic covers the country/region picker module and describes how to configure it in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The country/region picker module uses the [geo detection and redirection](geo-detection-redirection.md) feature in Dynamics 365 Commerce to show recommended URLs to customers who request an e-commerce site URL that isn't associated with their country or region.

For example, a customer in Canada requests a site URL that isn't associated with Canada. In this case, the country/region picker module shows a dialog box that recommends site URLs that are associated with Canada. The following illustration shows an example of the country/region picker dialog box.

| Country: Country URL       | Text        | The URL that corresponds to the channel and locale that are configured for the country or region on the **Channels** page in Commerce site builder (**Site settings \> Channels**).

| Action link                | Action link | An optional link that appears at the bottom of the dialog box. For example, this link can point to an internal page that provides a list of all countries and regions that the site supports. |

## Add a country/region picker module to a page

The country/region picker module can be added to the header module either directly or via a shared fragment. For more information about header modules, see [Header module](author-header-module.md).

## Configure the country/region picker module in Commerce site builder

> [!NOTE]
> The URLs that you recommend to your customers must be configured as country objects in the country/region picker module.

For each URL that you want to show and recommend to customers, follow these steps in Commerce site builder.

1. Select the country/region picker module slot.
1. In the properties pane, under **Country list**, select **Add country**.
1. Select the new **Country** box.
1. In the **Display string** field, enter a display name (for example, **Canada**).
1. Optional: In the **Display substring** field, enter a display substring (for example, **French**, or **fr-ca**).
1. Optional: Select an image from the media library.
1. In the **Country URL** field, enter the URL. This URL must exactly match the URL that appears on the **Channels** page and is mapped to the channel, including the locale that is associated with the country or region.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Repeat these steps for any other country URLs that you want the country/region picker module to show.
