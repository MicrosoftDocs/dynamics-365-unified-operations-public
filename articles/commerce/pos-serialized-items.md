# Work with serialized items in the POS

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Many retailers sell products that require serial control. These products are referred to as *serialized items*. Some retailers might want to maintain serial numbers in store or warehouse inventory for tracking purposes. Other retailers might want to capture serial numbers during the sales process, for service and warranty purposes. This topic explains how you can manage serialized items in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce point of sale (POS) application.

## Serial number configurations

An item is considered a serialized item if it's assigned a tracking dimension group that's set up to allow for serial numbers. In Commerce headquarters, on the **Tracking dimension groups** page, select the **Active** option to enable serial numbers for the inventory process, or select the **Active in sales process** option to enable serial numbers for the sales process.

On the **Tracking dimensions** FastTab, turn on the **Blank receipt allowed** parameter to allow serial number to be an optional input during the inventory receipt process of serialized item. Turning off this parameter enforces serial number to be a required input. Similarly, the **Blank issue allowed** parameter controls whether serial number is required during the inventory shipment process.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Inbound inventory** and **Outbound inventory** POS operations to register or validate serial numbers against a serialized item, you must configure that item to be assigned a tracking dimension group that's set up to allow for serial numbers for the **Active** option, not the **Active in sales process** option.

## Serial number management page

In the **Inbound inventory** and **Outbound inventory** POS operations, if the item that is being selected, received, or shipped is a serialized item, the **Details** pane contains a **Manage serial number** option that links to the **Serial number management** page where you can register or validate serial numbers for the item. Alternatively, you can open the **Serial number management** page either by selecting the **Serial number** action on the app bar of the order details view, or by selecting the **Manage serial number** option in the dialog box that prompts you during the receiving or shipping process. 

The **Serial number management** page lists all open serial number lines that are pending registration or validation. There might be two tabs on this page: one for the current item and another for all serialized items in the order.

The **Status** field on the **Serial number management** page provides information about the current stage that each serial number is in:

- **Not registered** – The serial number hasn't been provided, or the preregistered serial number hasn't yet been validated (in the receiving process).
- **Registering** – The serial number has been registered and saved locally to the store's channel database, or the preregistered serial number has been validated. Only serial numbers that have a status of **Registering** will be submitted to Commerce headquarters when you finish receiving or fulfillment.

## Receive serialized items

The **Inbound inventory** POS operation lets users perform the following tasks for serialized items:

- Register serial numbers against serialized items when those items are received in the store via a purchase order.
- Validate preregistered serial numbers against serialized items when those items are received in the store via a purchase order or transfer order.

### Register serial numbers against serialized items

For a purchase order, you'll be prompted with a dialog box with the **Manage serial number** option during the receiving process of a serialized item. You can select that option to open the **Serial number management** page and start to register serial numbers. You can also skip this step during the receiving process and provide the input later, before the receipt is posted.

By default, the tab for the current item is shown. All serial number lines have an empty serial number value and a status of **Not registered**. You can scan serial number bar codes, or you can select **Serial number** on the app bar to continuously enter serial numbers. The serial numbers that you enter appear in the list, and their status is changed to **Registering**. The maximum number of serial numbers that you can register in the list is equal to the receiving quantity. If you make a mistake, you can select **Edit** or **Clear** in the **Details** pane to make changes to the serial numbers that you entered.

You can also register serial numbers on the **All serialized items** tab of the **Serial number management** page. In the list, select the item that you want to register serial numbers against.

### Validate serial numbers on serialized items

For a transfer order, the outbound side must preregister serial numbers on the serialized items during the shipment process. For a purchase order, the supplier might provide serial number information through an Advance Shipment Notice (ASN), and you can preregister the numbers on the items that will be shipped. In both cases, the serial numbers are known before the receipt. Therefore, on the inbound side, you just have to validate that you received what you were supposed to receive.

To validate serial numbers, you can open the **Serial number management** page either during the receiving process or at any time before the receipt is posted. For each serialized item that has preregistered serial numbers, all the serial numbers are automatically set to an initial status of **Not registered** on this page. To validate serial numbers, you can scan or enter them. As serial number are entered, the application validates whether they match preregistered serial numbers. If they match, their status is changed to **Registering**. Otherwise, you receive an error message. Alternatively, you can directly select a serial number, then select the **Validate serial number** option in the **Details** pane to quickly mark that serial number as validated. The maximum number of serial numbers that you can validate in the list is equal to the receiving quantity.

You can also validate serial numbers on the **All serialized items** tab of the **Serial number management** page. In the list, select the item that you want to validate serial numbers against.

## Ship serialized items

You can use the **Outbound inventory** POS operation to register serial numbers against serialized items when shipping them out of current store via a transfer order.

### Register serial numbers against serialized items

For a transfer order, you'll be prompted with a dialog box with the **Manage serial number** option during the shipping process of a serialized item. You can select the option to open the **Serial number management** page and start to register serial numbers. You can also skip this step during the shipping process and provide the input later, before the shipment is posted.

By default, the tab for the current item is shown. All serial number lines have an empty serial number value and a status of **Not registered**. You can scan serial number bar codes, or you can select **Serial number** on the app bar to continuously enter serial numbers. The serial numbers that you enter appear in the list, and their status is changed to **Registering**. The maximum number of serial numbers that you can register in the list is equal to the shipping quantity. If you make a mistake, you can select **Edit** or **Clear** in the **Details** pane to make changes to the serial numbers that you entered.

You can also register serial numbers on the **All serialized items** tab on the **Serial number management** page. In the list, select the item that you want to register serial numbers against.

Optionally, you can enable serial number availability validation during the serial number registration against an outbound transfer order. With this validation, if you attempt to ship a serial number that is not available in the inventory of the shipping store, you will receive an error message and must provide a different number.

To enable such validation, as a prerequisite, you need to schedule the following jobs to run on a recurring basis:

- **Retail and Commerce** > **Retail and Commerce IT** > **Products and inventory** > **Product availability with tracking dimensions**
- **Retail and Commerce** > **Distribution schedules** > **1130** (**Product availability**)
