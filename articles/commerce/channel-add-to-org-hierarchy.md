This topic describes how to add a channel to an organizational hierarchy in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Channels need to be associated with one or more organizational hierarchies. Before creating channels, you need to confirm that your organizational hierarchies have been set up.  

See [Organizational hierarchies](channels-org-hierarchies.md) for more details on how to create organizational hierarchies.

## Select a hierarchy

To select a hierarchy, follow these steps.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules \> Retail and commerce \> Channel Setup \> Organization hierarchies**.
1. From the list, select the organization hierarchy that you'll be adding the channel to.
1. On the action pane, select **View** to view hierarchy details.

The following image shows organizational hierarchy details for the selected hierarchy.

## Add a channel to a hierachy node

To add a channel to a hierachy node, follow these steps.

1. On the action pane, select **Edit**.
1. Select the hierachy node you want the channel added to, then from the **Insert** drop-down list, select **Retail Channel**. 
1. Select the channel to add, then select the **OK** button.
1. On the action pane, select **Save**.
1. On the action pane, select **Publish** and provide an **Effective date** in the past to have this action go into effect immediately.

The following image shows how to select a channel to add to a hierarchy node.
