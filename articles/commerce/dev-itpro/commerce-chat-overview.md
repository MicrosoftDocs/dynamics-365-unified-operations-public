This article provides an overview of the chat features available when the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Omnichannel for Customer Service and Microsoft Copilot Studio applications are integrated with Dynamics 365 Commerce e-commerce websites.

## Omnichannel for Customer Service

Omnichannel for Customer Service is a robust application that extends the power of Dynamics 365 Customer Service. It enables organizations to instantly connect and engage with their customers via channels such as live chat, voice, and Short Message Service (SMS).

## Microsoft Copilot Studio

Microsoft Copilot Studio lets you create powerful AI-powered chatbots for a range of requests.
