# Retail software development kit (SDK)

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of the Retail SDK. The Dynamics 365 Commerce platform provides a rich commerce SDK that developers can use to customize and add new features to the product. The multi-tier architecture of the commerce platform provides simplified options to customize and extend the client, business logic, and data layers independently. The Retail SDK includes libraries, NuGet packages, a POS application, code samples, templates, and tools. You can use the SDK to create extensions apps, add features, and modify existing functionalities of Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Retail SDK Overview

The Retail software development kit (SDK) includes the code, code samples, templates, and tools that are required to extend or customize existing commerce functionality. The SDK supports rapid development, full MSBuild integration, and package generation.

> [!NOTE]
> The Retail SDK supports the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 standard. Any customization build using the Retail SDK should follow the TLS 1.2 standard.

## Download the Retail SDK

The Retail SDK is available in development environments provisioned using LCS, in the VHDs downloaded from LCS, and in hotfix packages deployed to the LCS environment. For more information, see [Deploy and access development environments](../../../dev-itpro/dev-tools/access-instances.md) and [Apply updates to cloud environments](../../../dev-itpro/deployment/apply-deployable-package-system.md).

To access the Retail SDK, login to the development VM and navigate to the **K:\\RetailSDK** folder. You can obtain new versions of the Retail SDK by applying any Commerce binary hotfix from LCS to the development environment. After the hotfix deployment, the new version of the hotfix can be found inside the **K:\\RetailSDK\\Update** folder.

If the current version of the SDK contains some extensions, then after upgrading, the config files and extension projects need to be merged from the previous version of the SDK to the new version of the SDK. This merge is required only if your previous version of SDK includes extensions, and they need to be migrated to the new version. For more information, see [Upgrade the Retail channel extension to the latest Retail SDK](../RetailSDK-update.md) for detailed steps. We recommend that you integrate the SDK with a source control system such as Git or Azure.

## Full MSBuild integration

The Retail SDK is a build system. A simple MSBuild command from the root of the SDK builds everything. This behavior eliminates questions about how and where to build from, and guarantees consistency and reproducibility. Therefore, the Retail SDK can easily be integrated with a build pipeline like Azure Pipelines. For more information, see [Set up Commerce SDK build pipeline](SDK-build-pipeline.md).

## Prerequisites

To **develop** or **build** extensions using the Retail SDK you must have the following components:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community, Professional, or Enterprise edition (VM) with the following components:

    - .NET Desktop development
    - Universal Windows Platform development
    - ASP.NET and web development
    - Azure development
    - Node.js development
    - .NET Core cross-platform development
    - Mobile development with .NET (required for hybrid app development)

- Runtimes

    + [sdk-2.1.202-windows-x64-installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-2.1.202-windows-x64-installer)
    + [sdk-2.1.513-windows-x64-installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-2.1.513-windows-x64-installer)
    + [runtime-2.0.9-windows-x64-installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-2.0.9-windows-x64-installer)
    + [runtime-2.1.17-windows-x64-installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-2.1.17-windows-x64-installer)
    + Install Typescript version 2.2.2. In Visual Studio, go to **Tools > Get Tools and Features**. Select the **Individual components** tab and select the **TypeScript 2.2 SDK from SDKs, libraries, and frameworks** section and install it. Visual Studio 2017 has Typescript 3.1 as default. You need to install version 2.2.2, because the POS app is based on Typescript 2.2.2.

## Build the Retail SDK

Before starting development with Retail SDK, you must do a full msbuild from the root of the SDK folder to restore all the packages.

1. Open the developer command prompt for Visual Studio 2017 or the MSBuild 15.0 command prompt.
2. Navigate to the Retail SDK folder in developer command prompt.
3. Run the msbuild by typing the command **msbuild /t:rebuild** from the root of the SDK folder. The **dirs.proj** file in the root of the SDK (**RetailSDK\\dirs.proj** or **RetailSDK\\Code\\dirs.proj**) contains all the necessary details to build  the full SDK.

## Best practices for naming

The C\# source code in the SDK uses the Contoso namespace. Therefore, it's easier to distinguish Microsoft types and extension types. If your extension code references a type from the Microsoft binary, reference it by using Microsoft.Dynamics to distinguish between Microsoft libraries and the libraries from the extension. The extension libraries must not begin with Microsoft.Dynamics name.

## Deployment packages

After extension development (Commerce runtime, Retail Server, database scripts, POS, and Hardware station) you can use the Retail SDK to generate deployment packages. Packages can be deployed to test, sandbox, and production environments. For more information, see [Create deployable packages](retail-sdk-packaging.md)

## Dependencies, build order, and full build

You should build all the extensions and required out-of-box projects ([a full msbuild from the root of the SDK](#build-the-retail-sdk)).

- You should build your extension, POS, and packaging projects, but you do not need to build the sample projects included in the Retail SDK. You can edit the **dirs.proj** in the Retail SDK to remove unwanted sample projects, but don’t remove the packaging and POS projects from the list.
- Include the extension project in the **dirs.proj** file of the respective folder so that when you run msbuild from the root SDK folder, all the extension and required out-of-box projects are built.
- The **dirs.proj** in the Retail SDK root folder is sequenced in the right order to build all the required projects and then the packaging project. The sequence must correct so that the project and dependencies are built correctly.

## Normal configuration/code signing

For Modern POS, create an app package signing certificate in order to build correctly or use Cloud POS. Follow the instructions at [Create a certificate for package signing](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/package/create-certificate-package-signing) to create a PFX file. Then copy the PFX file to the **BuildTools** folder, and update the **BuildTools\\Customization.settings** file with the correct name  using the **ModernPOSPackageCertificateKeyFile** element.

**BuildTools\\Customization.settings** holds most of the configuration values for the SDK. The highlighted items in the following illustration are the global values. These values control how build is managed for binaries, components, and packages are named, versioned, and code-signed.

:::image type="content" source="media/retailsdk07.png" alt-text="Screenshot of code for BuildTools Customization settings":::

It's good practice to sign your assemblies with a strong name, even though a strong name isn't required. To learn how to create your own key file if you don't already have one, see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6f05ezxy(v=vs.110).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6f05ezxy(v=vs.110).aspx).

The generated installer files for self-service components like MPOS, Hardware station, Store scale unit can be signed with [SignTool.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool).

Both the strong name key file and the app package signing certificate can be stored inside the BuildTools folder or in Azure key vault, for password protected or secured certificate use Azure Key vault.

## Customizing the build

### Adding new projects

It's easy to add new projects to the Retail SDK's build system. You can either clone one of the many existing projects or start a new project. You just have to make some adjustments in a text editor, as shown in the following illustration. The relative path of the **Import** elements should be adjusted, and the **AssemblyName** element should use the predefined **AssemblyNamePrefix** property. These adjustments are required in order to get versioning, code signing, uniform assembly naming, automatic dropping to the References folder, and other tasks for free.

![Screenshot of code for adding new projects](media/retailsdk09.png)

### Changing the build order or adding to the build

The whole directory tree of the Retail SDK is built with the help of MSBuild traversal files (dirs.proj files). The following illustration shows the main traversal file of the Retail SDK. Similar files might also exist in subdirectories. Notice that Visual Studio solution files (.sln files) are similar to traversal files. Both "direct" the MSBuild engine to process other build scripts.

![Screenshot of code for changing build order or adding to build](media/retailsdk10.png)

After new code is added, most of it should be located in a new folder, and you must add it to the traversal structure by adding to one or multiple **dirs.proj** files. The **Extensions** folder appears highlighted on line 10 in the previous illustration. The quickest way to get started with a new **dirs.proj** file is to copy an existing file, correct the paths in the **Import** elements, and update the **ProjectFiles** elements in the **ItemGroup** element.

### Build script customization

When you must implement new build steps, keep in mind that the existing scripts might be updated by a Retail SDK update later. Best practice is to minimize the editing of any file, or add new files instead. If you require new global MSBuild properties, **BuildTools\\Microsoft.Dynamics.RetailSDK.Build.props** is a good place to add them. Likewise, **BuildTools\\Microsoft.Dynamics.RetailSDK.Build.targets** can be used to add new build processing targets. If only one project requires special handling, it is better to explicitly make the change there. If you require new local MSBuild properties, add a new file that is named local.props in the same directory. Alternatively, add a **local.targets** file if you require local build processing targets.

## Developer productivity

The **CommerceRuntime** and **RetailServer** extension DLLs must be copied into the bin folder of the locally installed RetailServer web application. A user can configure the **Customization.setting** file so that the DLLs are automatically copied into the bin folder of the local RetailServer web application whenever new versions of these files are built from the extension project.

![Screenshot of code to automatically add new DLLs](media/retailsdk11.png)

## Application lifecycle management

A good ALM solution provides version control, builds, automated builds, planning tools, tracking tools, dashboards, customization, and more. The Retail SDK is organized in such a way that it supports these tasks.

### Branching and versioning

To work efficiently in a team, or even just to be able to go back and look at some changes that were done in the past, you must have a good branching strategy and versioning discipline. The following illustration shows a simple branching strategy that might work well for most teams. The version numbers are fictitious. For more information, see, [Adopt a Git branching strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops) .

:::image type="content" source="media/retailsdk12.png" alt-text="Diagram of branching and merging":::

### Retail SDK mirror branch

An important point to emphasize is that the non-customized Retail SDK should be stored in your source control. You don't have to store every version, but the versions that your team wants to snap to should be added (these versions might be cumulative updates or hotfixes). Only a simple merge of all changes (additions, changes, and deletions) should be done. No other development work should occur in this branch. The Retail SDK has its own version. All Commerce binaries and packages that are included have the same version. The version can also be found in the root of the Retail SDK in a file that is named Microsoft-version.txt.

### Customization branch

For development a new customization branch should be created. At the beginning of the initial branch-out, this branch will be an exact copy of the Retail SDK mirror branch. This is the branch for team's development. The version of the customization branch must be incremented at least every time that a build is created for testing, or it can even be incremented daily. The file version to increment is defined in Customization.setting file by using the **CustomVersion** property. If you update it and rebuild, all binaries, packages, manifest files are updated accordingly.

The **CustomAssemblyVersion** property should be updated only when the update isn't backward compatible and/or for major new releases. In other words, update this property rarely. In the previous illustration, the current file version of the customization branch is 1.0.2.\* (based on Microsoft version 7.0.2200.3). The file version of the first rolled-out release was 1.0.0.40 (based on 7.0.2000.0). When a testing phase is completed, and the final packages are being deployed with that version, it's important that you increment the version (or create a source control label).
