# Download Retail SDK samples and reference packages from GitHub and NuGet

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains to how to download Retail software development kit (SDK) samples from GitHub and reference packages from a public feed. The Retail SDK includes the code samples, templates, and tools that are required to extend or customize Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce functionality. The SDK is published in different repositories (repos) in GitHub, depending on the extension components.

This article applies to Retail SDK version 10.0.16 or later. For more information about how to download earlier versions of the Retail SDK, see [Retail software development kit (SDK)](retail-sdk-overview.md).

The following sample repositories contain code samples, templates, and tools that are required to extend or customize existing Commerce functionality. Samples are published to repositories in GitHub based on the Commerce extension components. You don't have to close these repositories, instead, you can download and use the samples and template projects.

## Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit repository

The [Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit) repository contains the sample code for customizing the Commerce runtime (CRT), Retail Server, and channel database.

The samples in the repository are organized by Dynamics 365 Commerce application release. Each branch in the repository points to an application release of Dynamics 365 Commerce. Use the release branch that matches your go-live version. You don't have to clone this repository, instead, you can download and use the samples and template projects.

## Download reference packages for creating APIs, and for consuming messages, request, entities, and contracts

Commerce contracts, messages, entities, and request packages are published in this public feed for Commerce extension code that consumes and customizes existing functionalities, or builds new functionalities for the Dynamics 365 Commerce application.

Use the packages from [index.json](https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/commerce-partner/Registry/_packaging/dynamics365-commerce/nuget/v3/index.json). You can add the package source location in the **nuget.config** file of your extension project file, as shown in the following code example:

```xml
<packageSources>
    <add key="dynamics365-commerce" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/commerce-partner/Registry/_packaging/dynamics365-commerce/nuget/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    </packageSources>
```

An extension project can consume the correct version if you add the package reference to the project and include the full version number. Alternatively, to make the extension project always get the latest version, use a wildcard character. We recommend that you use the full version number, and that you update the version, based on your go-live version. There are two options:

+ Without a wildcard character:

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.Runtime" Version="9.28" />;
    ```

+ With a wildcard character:

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.Runtime" Version="9.28.*" />;
    ```

For every hotfix and new application release, a version of the package will be published in the same public feed, consume the right package version based on the version required for your go-live version. Consuming the higher version of the package than your go-live application version may result in runtime and deployment failures.

## Set up an Azure pipeline for build automation and package generation

To set up an Azure pipeline, see [Set up a build pipeline for the independent-packaging SDK](../build-pipeline.md).

## Best practice and branching strategies

For detailed information about the Git branching strategy, see [Git branching strategy](/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance).

The following branching strategies are based on the way that Microsoft uses Git. For more information, see [How we use Git at Microsoft](/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/use-git-microsoft).

Keep your branch strategy simple. Build your strategy from these three concepts:

- Use feature branches for all new features and bug fixes.
- Merge feature branches into the main branch using pull requests.
- Keep a high quality, up-to-date main branch.

### Create a new feature branch for development and bug fixes

Create a new feature main branch for your extension, following the naming convention in [Git branching doc for sample naming convention](/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance#name-your-feature-branches-by-convention).

### Create a new development branch

To create a new development branch, follow these steps:

1. Create a private branch for development.

    ```dos
    - git checkout -b private/{username}/{feature/description}
    ```

2. Add and commit the changes to the development branch. For example:

    ```dos
    git -add . 
    git commit -m "commit message"
    ```

3. After the development is completed, tested, and validated, push the changes to the main branch. For example:

    ```dos
    git push <remote> <branch>
    ```

    Or:

    ```dos
    git push origin {private branch name}
    ```

### Create a release branch after development

To create a release branch after development, follow these steps:

1. After the development changes are pushed into the main branch, create a new release branch, and create the deployable packages from the release branch.

    ```dos
    - Git checkout -b release/x.x.x
    ```

2. Merge the changes from the release branch back to main branch if any changes were made in the release branch. For example:

    ```dos
    - git checkout main git merge release/x.x.x
    ```

### Extension hotfix branch

1. Create a hotfix branch for extension from the main branch. For more information, see [Create a release branch after development](#create-a-release-branch-after-development).
2. Release the fix.
3. Merge the changes back to the main branch.

### Merge a new release branch to main and development branch

After a new version of the samples released, if necessary, merge your development branch with the new branch. The repository contains only samples, so it's not required to get the updated changes from the branch. For example:

```dos
- git checkout main git merge release/x.x.x
```
