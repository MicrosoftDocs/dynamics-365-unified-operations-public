# Channel merchandising configuration validator

[!include[banner](../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to use the channel merchandising configuration validator in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce headquarters to find missing and invalid configurations for products, categories, and attributes by channel.

Incorrect and missing configurations that are related to products, categories, catalogs, and attributes can cause issues when products are sold in e-commerce and point of sale (POS) Commerce channels. The Dynamics 365 Commerce channel merchandising configuration validator is designed to identify and address these configurations. You can use the channel merchandising configuration validator to efficiently fix issues and streamline your operations in Commerce headquarters.

## Capabilities

The channel merchandising configuration validator provides a wide range of capabilities that can help optimize your operations in headquarters.

- **Proactive validation** – The configuration validator proactively identifies and reports missing or invalid configurations that are related to products, categories, variants, attributes, and catalogs.
- **Validation across multiple locales** – The configuration validator runs comprehensive validations across all locales to ensure that all merchandising configurations are verified for a selected channel.
- **Deep linking** – After invalid configurations are identified, the configuration validator streamlines the correction process by creating deep links to specific pages in headquarters. Therefore, you can quickly go to the sources of the issues and efficiently fix them.
- **Extensive rule set** – Thanks to its comprehensive set of over 40 distinct validation rules, the configuration validator offers a robust and reliable solution for identifying and fixing configuration issues.

## Run validation for a new channel

To run validation for a new channel in headquarters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Retail and Commerce IT \> Channel merchandising configuration validator**.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Channel ID** field, enter or select a value (for example, **AW Business online store**).
1. Select **Validate**. Wait until the validation progress reaches 100 percent and the validation phase is shown as **Completed**.
1. After validation is completed, select the **Channel name** value to view a detailed summary of the validation results. There are two viewing options:

    - **By entity** – This option shows all validated entity records, together with messages, errors, and warnings.
    - **By rules** – This option shows each rule that was validated, together with the corresponding numbers of messages, errors, and warnings.

1. Select **Show details** to load an additional grid that shows the details of messages, errors, and warnings. You can filter this grid by issue type. From the **Show details** view, you can go directly to the entity record to fix the configuration that has an issue.
1. After you fix the configurations across all entities, you can return to the **Validation summary** view and select **Validate failed** to rerun validation for the rules that previously failed.

## Run validation for all channels

To run validation for all channels in headquarters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Retail and Commerce IT \> Channel merchandising configuration validator**.
1. Select **Create all**. The channel grid shows the list of channels.
1. In the channel grid, select the channels that you want to run the validation process for. To run validation for all channels, on the grid header, select the checkbox that selects all channels.
1. Select **Validate**.
