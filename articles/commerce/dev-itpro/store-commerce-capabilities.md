# Store Commerce app capabilities

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Store Commerce app is the modern point of sale (POS) experience for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. It enables businesses to process transactions in-store and manage back-office operations such as inventory and order-proccessing. The app also enables businesses to manage customer relationships with loyalty and clienteling. 

Powered by Commerce Scale Unit (CSU), the Store Commerce app provides a complete omni-channel solution. For example, a customer can buy a product online and pick it up in a nearby store, thereby continuing their shopping journey across channels without losing any data. 

This article provides an overview of the Store Commerce app capabilities.
