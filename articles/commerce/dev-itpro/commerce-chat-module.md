# Commerce Chat with Omnichannel for Customer Service module

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the *Commerce Chat with Omnichannel for Customer Service* module in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

In the Commerce version 10.0.29 release, a new Commerce Chat with Omnichannel for Customer Service module has been added to the Commerce module library. The Commerce chat feature provides e-commerce customers with the chat capabilities of Dynamics 365 Omnichannel for Customer Service, which includes live agent support to help address customer queries, provide customer service, and facilitate sales for Commerce customers.

The Commerce chat feature enables retailers to achieve these goals:

- Increase personalized engagement with customers to help improve customer retention.
- Improve customer service through the integration of human agent and self-service chatbots.
- Help agents gain experience through real-time customer profile, order, and purchasing data that drives operational improvements and engagement.
- Improve overall customer satisfaction to help increase sales.

The following capabilities are available as part of the Commerce chat feature:

- Commerce Chat with Omnichannel for Customer Service
- The addition of **Commerce Call Center** as an application tab in the agent experience in Dynamics 365 Omnichannel for Customer Service

## Prerequisites for Omnichannel for Customer Service

As a prerequisite, you must configure chat in the Omnichannel for Customer Service Administration widget and obtain some of the parameters to configure the Commerce chat experience. For instructions, see [Configure a chat channel](/dynamics365/customer-service/set-up-chat-widget).

After you configure chat in the Omnichannel for Customer Service Administration widget, you'll get a script that resembles the following example.

`<script id="Microsoft_Omnichannel_LCWidget" src="https://oc-cdn-ocprod.azureedge.net/livechatwidget/scripts/LiveChatBootstrapper.js" data-app-id="xxxx-xxx-4be7-bcd5-1d118ecffe1f" data-org-id="5a0e73c0-xxxx-xxxxx-xxx- 76df135f375d" data-org-url="https://xxsxxxxssdb348f-crm.omnichannelengagementhub.com"></script>`

Copy this script, because you'll need the values in it to configure the chat module.

### Commerce Chat with Omnichannel for Customer Service mandatory fields

The following table shows the script values from the Omnichannel for Customer Service Administration widget that are required to configure the Commerce Chat with Omnichannel for Customer Service module.

## Add Commerce headquarters as an application tab for Omnichannel for Customer Service

You can add an application tab for Commerce headquarters in Omnichannel for Customer Service. Live agents can then use the user interface for the Omnichannel for Customer Service agent experience to easily access the Dynamics 365 Commerce Customer Service module that contains contextual information for the customer together with their sales orders information. In addition, customer service agents can place new orders, initiate returns, and verify order status information.

### Create a new application tab that loads Commerce headquarters in an iFrame module 

To create a new application tab that loads Commerce headquarters in an iFrame module, follow these steps.

1. Open the [Power Apps Maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Apps**.
1. Select **Customer Service admin center**.
1. Go to **Agent experience**.
1. For **Application tab templates**, select **Manage**.
1. Create a new application tab of the **Third-party website** type. For instructions, see [Manage application tab templates](/dynamics365/app-profile-manager/application-tab-templates?tabs=customerserviceadmincenter).
1. Under **Parameters**, in the **Value** field of the **url** parameter, enter the following URL, where `<YourOrganizationHeadquartersURL>` and `<LegalEntityname>` are replaced with the appropriate values. Omnichannel customer service reads **{AccountNumber}** from the chat context. Therefore, leave **{AccountNumber}** as is.

    `https://<YourOrganizationHeadquartersURL>/?mi=MCRCustomerService&cmp=<LegalEntityName>&embedded=true&customerId={AccountNumber}`

1. Leave the **Value** field of the **data** parameter blank.
