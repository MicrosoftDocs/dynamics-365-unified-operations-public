# Sort Commerce Data Exchange packages by primary index

[!include [banner](../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

This article provides an overview of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce feature to sort Commerce Data Exchange (CDX) packages by a primary index per package.

The **Sort CDX packages by primary index** feature optimizes the data preprocessing performance of data transformation. This feature doesn't change any data application logic for a Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) or Store Commerce offline database, and it doesn't improve performance for either of those components.

## Prerequisites

Turn on the **Sort CDX packages by primary index** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Feature value

This feature provides extra performance when using Microsoft Dataverse with Digital Commerce, Headless Commerce, or Dynamics 365 Commerce (when Dataverse is used).

## Using this feature

After you turn on this feature in **Feature management**, it works without any visibility to the user.
