# Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS) certification

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 is implemented and the PA-DSS certification has not yet been completed by Microsoft, there may be potential impact to the retailer's Payment Card Industry (PCI) audit and certification. Specifically, until the PA-DSS certification is complete for the associated version, PCI certification can become more difficult and involved as the Payment Application may come into scope of testing during the certification.

This topic explains the past, current, and pending listings of PA-DSS certification for Microsoft Dynamics 365. To view the current certifications, see [PCI PA-DSS certified payment applications](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/payment_applications).
