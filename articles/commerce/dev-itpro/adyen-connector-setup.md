This article describes how to sign up with Adyen and set up the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen. For an overview of the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen, see [Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen overview](adyen-connector.md).

## Sign up with Adyen

To use the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen, you must have a separate agreement with Adyen. To learn more about Adyen's services, or to create a test merchant account, visit the [Adyen website](https://www.adyen.com/signup).

## Setup and configuration

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions assume that you've already signed up for a merchant account with Adyen, and that you have access to the Adyen merchant dashboard.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed before payments can be configured in any channel.

#### Configure your Adyen account settings for Dynamics 365 Commerce

In addition to the instructions below, you must also configure your Adyen account settings for Dynamics 365 Commerce. For instructions on setting up Adyen for Dynamics 365 Commerce, see [Set up the Adyen payment connector for Dynamics 365](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/microsoft-dynamics).

#### Set up a processor for new credit cards

To process payments across point of sale (POS) terminals, a call center, or Commerce, you must configure a new default payment processor for new credit cards. Follow these steps to configure a default payment processor.

1. Sign in to Commerce headquarters and go to **Accounts receivable \> Payments setup \> Payment services**.

### POS payment terminal

#### Onboard and configure an Adyen payment terminal

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions assume that you have access to an Adyen payment terminal.

Go to the [Point of sale](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/point-of-sale) page on the Adyen website and follow the instructions to onboard your Adyen payment terminal. Skip any steps that instruct you to download Adyen-specific apps. During the onboarding process, make a note of the following information for each payment terminal. You will need this information in the [Configure the payment terminal IP address and EFT POS register number](#configure-the-payment-terminal-ip-address-and-eft-pos-register-number) section later in this article.

- IP address of the payment terminal
- POIID (POIID is composed of the serial number and model number of the device. It is used to uniquely identify the device.)

After the payment terminal is onboarded, sign in to the [Adyen Customer Area](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/login.shtml), go to the terminal that you want to configure, and make a note of the following information for each payment terminal. You will need this information in the [EFT service for local network communication](#eft-service-for-local-network-communication) section later in this article.

- Key identifier
- Key passphrase
- Key version

#### Set up a Dynamics 365 POS hardware profile

1. Sign in to Commerce headquarters and go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> POS setup \> POS profiles \> Hardware profiles**.
1. Select the hardware profile to add the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen for.
1. Follow the steps in the [EFT service](#eft-service) and [PIN pad](#configure-the-pin-pad) sections that follow.

#### EFT service

The Adyen payment connector can be configured to communicate with devices via the local network or through Adyen's cloud backend. For environments with unreliable internet service, or where offline mode is required, the **Local** setup should be used. For environments with strong internet connections, or if a static IP address can't be assigned to the payment terminal, the **Cloud** architecture may work best.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

##### Configure the PIN pad

1. On the **PIN pad** FastTab, in the **PIN pad** field, select **Network**.
1. In the **Device name** field, enter **MicrosoftAdyenDeviceV001**.

#### Set up a Dynamics 365 register

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions assume that there is a dedicated mapping between a POS register and an Adyen payment terminal. For a hardware station that is based on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channels \> Stores \> All stores**, and select the store that you're setting up. Then, on the page for that store, on the **Hardware Stations** FastTab, follow the same instructions.

Payment terminals may not be used by multiple hardware stations. If a payment terminal must be shared by multiple POS devices, an IIS hardware station must be deployed to manage communications with the payment terminal. 

##### Configure the payment terminal IP address and EFT POS register number

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> POS setup \> Registers**.
1. Select the register to link to the Adyen payment terminal.
1. On the **POS Registers** page, on the **General** FastTab, in the **EFT** section, in the **EFT POS register number** field, enter a unique number. 
1. In the **Profiles** section, in the **Hardware profile** field, select the hardware profile that you configured earlier.
1. Save your changes.
1. On the Action Pane, on the **Register** tab, in the **Hardware** group, select **Configure IP addresses**.
    1. **If using the "Local" architecture:** On the **IP address configuration** page, on the **PIN pad** FastTab, in the **IP address** field, enter the IP address of the terminal in the following format: `https://<IP address>:8443/nexo/<POIID>`. Here, **\<IP address\>** and **\<POIID\>** are the values that you made a note of when you onboarded the Adyen payment terminal. Here is an example: `https://192.168.1.3:8443/nexo/MX925-123456789`. The values in this URL are case-sensitive.
    1. **If using the "Cloud" architecture:** On the **IP address configuration** page, on the **PIN pad** FastTab, in the **IP address** field, enter the **POIID** value that you made a note of when you onboarded the Adyen payment terminal. Here is an example: `MX925-123456789`. The values in this field are case-sensitive.
1. If the payment terminal includes an onboard printer and you want to print receipts from the processor using that printer, enter **123** in the **Port** field that is separate from the **IP address** field in the **PIN pad** FastTab.

#### Update the Modern POS or IIS Hardware Station configuration

If you're packaging your own version of Modern POS by using the Retail SDK, you must follow these steps only one time in the SDK code before the installer is packaged. Otherwise, you must follow these steps after the standard Modern POS or IIS Hardware Station is installed.

1. Open the **dllhost.exe.config** file (for Modern POS) or the **web.config** file (for IIS Hardware Station).
1. Update the **PreloadedComposition** section as shown here, to switch from the legacy payment device adapter to the standard payment device adapter.

    ``` xml
    <PreloadedComposition>
        <composition>
            <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.HardwareStation.Peripherals.PaymentDeviceAdapter" />
            <!-- Switch from legacy to standard Payment Device Adapter.
            <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.HardwareStation.Peripherals.Legacy.PaymentDeviceAdapter" />
            -->
        </composition>
    </PreloadedComposition>
    ```
1. Update the **appSettings** variable **"PrintReceiptsOnCardDeclineOrVoid"** value to **True** to print decline or void responses from the processor. 

### Configure the connector for call center payments

To configure the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen for call center payments, follow the instructions in the [Set up a processor for new credit cards](#set-up-a-processor-for-new-credit-cards) section earlier in this article.

### Configure additional information for the connector
