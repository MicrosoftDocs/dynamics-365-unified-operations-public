# Commerce runtime (CRT) services

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Commerce runtime (CRT) is a collection of portable .NET libraries that contain the core business logic for the commerce channel and pricing functionality. To add or modify any business logic, you should customize CRT. Retail Modern POS or Cloud POS calls CRT to request that it perform business logic. CRT processes the request and then sends the response back to point of sale. Retail point of sale is like a thin client, all the business logic should be done in CRT.

A CRT service is a group of requests/responses. Any time that you do something in POS, POS sends a request to Commerce Scale Unit, and Commerce Scale Unit calls CRT. CRT processes the request and sends back the response.

This topic shows some important requests/responses that you can customize for your business scenario.

There are three main layers in CRT:

- Services
- Workflow
- Data Access

All CRT customization for business logic can be done in Services, Workflow or Data Access layers, other core layers that are required for CRT to work are runtime, authentication, and data access managers and you should avoid any customization on these layers.

## Overall flow
The overall flow looks like this:

CRT service request \< \> Zero or more workflow requests \< \> Zero or more data access requests

For example, multiple workflow and data access requests are called to perform the **Create sales order** service request.

## CRT services

Each CRT service contains one or more requests/responses. For example, the Customer service in CRT contains all the customer-related requests/responses. Each request/response is run in a different flow.

### Default CRT services

Many services in CRT support the functionality of the channel and store operations. You can add your own services or extend the existing services. The following table describes some of the services that you might customize for various business services.

For more information about each service, see the CRT request/response document in the Retail software development kit (SDK), at …\\RetailSDK\\Code\\Documents\\CommerceRuntimeMessages.chm.

For extension scenarios, you can override any of the requests in the service class. For example, to change the customer search flow, extend the **CustomersSearchServiceRequest** request from the **CustomerService** service.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't customize the service class. Instead, you extend the request/response in the service class. By itself, the service class doesn't have any logic. It just routes the call to the correct request.

## Sample service class implementation

```C#
public class MyService : IRequestHandler
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the collection of supported request types by this handler.
    /// </summary>

    public IEnumerable<Type> SupportedRequestTypes
    {
        get
        {
            return new[]
            {
                typeof(MyRequest),
                typeof(MyRequest1),
                typeof(MyRequest2),
            };
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Entry point to my service. Takes a service request and returns the result
    /// of the request execution.
    /// </summary>

    /// <param name="request">The my service request to execute.</param>

    /// <returns>Result of executing request, or null object for void operations.</returns>

    public Response Execute(Request request)
    {
        if (request == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("request");
        }
        Type requestType = request.GetType();
        Response response;
        if (requestType == typeof(MyRequest))
        {
            response = MyRequestCustomMethod((MyRequest)request);
        }
        else if (requestType == typeof(MyRequest1))
        {
            response = MyRequest1CustomMethod ((MyRequest1)request);
        }
        else if (requestType == typeof(MyRequest2))
        {
            response = MyRequest2CustomMethod ((MyRequest2)request);
        }
        else
        {
            throw new NotSupportedException(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "Request '{0}' is not supported.", request.GetType().ToString()));
        }
        return response;
    }
    private static MyResponse MyRequestCustomMethod (MyRequest request)
    {
        return myresponse;
    }
}
```

## Extension pattern for CRT

- **Create a new service class, and implement one or more requests/responses** – Use this approach to create a new feature.
- **Override the core request/response** – Use this approach to modify the standard workflow or business logic.
- **Add a pre-trigger or post-trigger for any request/response** – Use this approach to add business logic or add custom fields, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> It doesn't matter whether you create a data access request, a workflow request, or a service request. Everything in CRT is a request/response. You write the logic that is required in the request/response. Although the requests are classified into different types for logical reasons, everything is the same from the framework perspective.

The following three classes will be implemented in all our requests/responses:

- **Request class** – This class is POS/Retail server/E-commerce/CRT workflow class that is the request to do something.
- **Response class** – This class returns the response, based on the request to the caller.
- **Handler class** – This class contains the core logic for the request. In the handler class, you can call other requests, do custom logic, and so on.

### Request class

```C#
public class MyRequest : Request
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="MyRequest"/> class.
    /// </summary>

    public MyRequest ()
    {
    }

    // other properties
}
```

### Response class

```C#
public sealed class MyResponse : Response
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=" MyResponse"/> class.
    /// </summary>

    public MyResponse ()
    {
    }
}
```

### Handler class

```C#
public sealed class MyRequestHandler : SingleRequestHandler< MyRequest, MyResponse >
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Saves (updating if it exists and creating a new one if it does not) the shopping cart on the request.
    /// </summary>

    /// <param name="request">The request.</param>

    /// <returns><see cref=" MyResponse "/> object containing the cart with updated item quantities.</returns>

    protected override MyResponse Process(MyRequest request)
    {
        //logic class.
    }
}
```

## Workflow layer

On top of the Services layer is the Workflow layer. A workflow is a collection of services and business logic that together define business processes. For example, when a customer adds an item to the cart, you can use a workflow to get the price, do validation, check the inventory quantity, calculate shipping, calculate tax, and calculate discounts. You can customize the existing workflows, or you can create new workflows. You can even use a workflow to connect to a third-party system as part of your business processes.

Just like services, workflows use the request/response pattern. The request object inherited from the base CRT [Request](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.dynamics.commerce.runtime.messages.request.aspx) class. The response object inherited from the base CRT [Response](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.dynamics.commerce.runtime.messages.response.aspx) class. A workflow also has a request handler class that extends the [WorkflowRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj764791.aspx) class. To create a workflow, you create a request class and a response class, and you then create a request handler class that contains the business logic for the workflow.

For example, when you create a cash-and-carry transaction or a customer order, many different steps or workflows are completed before the order is created. One of the workflow steps in the order process is the Save cart request. The Save cart request workflow is responsible for saving any changes that are made to the cart from the POS. For example, when you add an item to the cart, change the quantity, and so on, anything that you do in the POS will cause a call to the SaveCart to save the changes to the POS and database.

The following three classes will be implemented in the Save cart request workflow.

### Request class

```C#
public class SaveCartRequest : Request
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="SaveCartRequest"/> class.
    /// </summary>

    public SaveCartRequest()
    {
    }

    // other properties
}
```

### Response class

```C#
public sealed class SaveCartResponse : Response
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="SaveCartResponse"/> class.
    /// </summary>

    public SaveCartResponse()
    {
    }
}
```

### Handler class

```C#
public sealed class SaveCartRequestHandler : SingleRequestHandler<SaveCartRequest, SaveCartResponse>
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Saves (updating if it exists and creating a new one if it does not) the shopping cart on the request.
    /// </summary>

    /// <param name="request">The request.</param>

    /// <returns><see cref="SaveCartResponse"/> object containing the cart with updated item quantities.</returns>

    protected override SaveCartResponse Process(SaveCartRequest request)
    {
        //logic class.
    }
}
```

All your workflow classes will follow the same pattern.

### Default workflows and handlers

The following table lists the default workflow requests and response. CRT services call the workflows request and response based on the operation you perform in retail point of sale. You can customize any of these workflows request and response according to your business scenario.
