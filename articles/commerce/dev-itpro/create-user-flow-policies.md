# Create user flow policies

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to create user flow policies in the Microsoft Azure portal.

User flows are the policies Microsoft Entra business-to-consumer (B2C) uses to provide secure sign in, sign up, edit profile, and forget password user experiences. Dynamics 365 Commerce uses these flows to perform the policy actions to interact with the Microsoft Entra B2C tenant. When a user interacts with these policies, they're redirected to the Microsoft Entra B2C tenant to perform the actions.

Microsoft Entra ID B2C provides three basic user flow types:
- Sign up and sign in
- Profile editing
- Password reset

You can choose to use the default user flows provided by Microsoft Entra ID, which will display a page hosted by Microsoft Entra ID B2C. Alternately, you can create an HTML page to control the look and feel of these user flow experiences. 

To customize the user policy pages with pages built in Dynamics 365 Commerce, see [Set up custom pages for user logins](../custom-pages-user-logins.md). For more information, see [Customize the interface of user experiences in Microsoft Entra ID B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-customize-ui).

### Create a sign-up and sign-in user flow policy

To create a sign-up and sign-in user flow policy, follow these steps.

1. In the Azure portal, select **User flows (policies)** in the left navigation pane.
1. On the **Microsoft Entra B2C – User flows (policies)** page, select **New User Flow**.
1. Select the **Sign up and sign in** policy, and then select the **Recommended** version.
1. Under **Name**, enter a policy name. This name will display afterwards with a prefix the portal assigns (for example, "B2C_1_").
1. Under **Identity providers**, in the **Local accounts** section, select **Email signup**. Email authentication is used in most common scenarios for Commerce. If you're also using social identity provider authentication, you can also select them at this time.
1. Under **Multifactor Authentication**, select the appropriate choice for your company. 
1. Under **User attributes and claims**, select options to collect attributes or return claims as appropriate. Select **Show more...** to get the full list of attributes and claims options. Commerce requires the following default options:

    | **Collect  attribute** | **Return  claim** |
    | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
    | Email Address          | Email Addresses   |
    | Given Name             | Given Name        |
    |                        | Identity Provider |
    | Surname                | Surname           |
    |                        | User’s Object ID  |

1. Select **Create**.

1. Under **Name**, enter the profile editing user flow. This name will display afterwards with a prefix the portal assigns (for example, "B2C_1_").
1. Under **Identity providers**, in the **Local accounts** section, select **Email SignIn**.
1. Under **User attributes**, select the following check boxes:
    
    | **Collect  attribute** | **Return  claim** |
    | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
    |                        | Email Addresses   |
    | Given Name             | Given Name        |
    |                        | Identity Provider |
    | Surname                | Surname           |
    |                        | User's Object ID  |
    
1. Select **Create**.

1. Under **Application claims**, select the following check boxes:
    - **Email addresses**
    - **Given Name**
