# Store Commerce app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and configure the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Store Commerce app for Windows. It applies to Dynamics 365 Commerce versions 10.0.25 and later.

The Dynamics 365 Commerce Store Commerce app is the next generation offering for physical stores. It unifies Modern point of sale (MPOS) and Cloud point of sale (CPOS) (now known as *Store Commerce for web*) into a single application, providing deployment choices to retailers, helping improve performance, and offering superior application lifecycle management (ALM) while retaining all the functionality of MPOS and Store Commerce for web, including extensibility.

The Store Commerce app provides rich commerce functionality for first-line workers such as cashiers, sales associates, inventory associates, stock clerks, and store managers, and allows these workers to perform Commerce operations such as: 

- Cash-and-carry transactions
- Cash and shift management
- Customer engagement
- Assisted selling
- Clienteling
- Endless aisle
- Order processing and fulfillment
- Inventory management
- Reporting

The Store Commerce app is a [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](/dotnet/desktop/wpf/?view=netdesktop-6.0&preserve-view=true) shell application for Windows that uses the [Microsoft Edge WebView2](/microsoft-edge/webview2/) control to render Store Commerce for web. Although Store Commerce for web can only run in a web browser, Store Commerce can run as a native Windows application like [MPOS](retail-modern-pos-architecture.md) does, providing the benefits of both the Store Commerce app and Store Commerce for web.

Store Commerce supports local hardware station and offline usage, and can be directly integrated with a payment terminal, printer, and cash drawer. It can use hardware devices without requiring you to set up a shared hardware station.

To render the user interface (UI), Store Commerce uses the Chromium engine instead of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app rendering framework. The Chromium engine has better rendering performance than the native JavaScript UWP app in Windows. The main difference between MPOS and Store Commerce is that Store Commerce uses the Chromium engine to render the app.

The Store Commerce app is also available for the Android and iOS platforms. For more information, see [Store Commerce for mobile](store-commerce-mobile.md). 

## Benefits of Store Commerce

- Application lifecycle management is simplified.
- Extension or independent software vendor (ISV) code developed for the Store Commerce app or Store Commerce for web using the Commerce software development kit (SDK) can be reused in Store Commerce with minimal changes.
- The industry-standard developer experience uses Microsoft Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- Store Commerce provides the benefits of both MPOS and Store Commerce for web.
- Performance is improved.
- POS and extension upgrades are simplified through the Commerce sealed installer framework.
- Dedicated hardware station is supported.
- Offline deployment is supported.

To review the capabilities of the Store Commerce app, see [Store Commerce app capabilities](../store-commerce-capabilities.md).

## Application lifecycle management

The Store Commerce app runs on Windows devices and can be downloaded from the [Shared asset library in Microsoft Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2/SharedAssetLibrary). On the **Shared asset library** page, select **Retail Self-service package** as the asset type, and then find the file that ends with "Store Commerce." Be sure to select the version for the Commerce release that you're using (for example, 10.0.25 or 10.0.26).

### Store Commerce deployment options

Store Commerce supports two types of deployment topologies:

- **In-app** – All components are deployed locally. Offline mode and local Hardware Station (HWS) are supported.
- **Hybrid** – Store Commerce renders the Cloud POS that is deployed in Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) and supports local Hardware Station. However, offline isn't supported.

There are no separate installers for the hybrid and in-app topologies. The deployment options are determined by the parameters that are passed during installation.

### In-app deployment

For the in-app deployment option, the application content is locally deployed. Store Commerce then renders the application content from its local deployment. It doesn't retrieve the Cloud POS UI hosted in the Commerce Scale Unit (CSU).

To update the application content, run the latest version of the Store Commerce installer. The application content isn't updated if you update the CSU, so you can manage the updates at individual registers.

In-app deployment supports offline mode. During installation, pass the `--installoffline` parameter to deploy the offline database. In offline mode, the application isn't able to connect to CSU or Commerce headquarters, and uses the locally deployed CRT.

> [!NOTE]
> During the installation of Store Commerce, users can pass parameters to select either the hybrid option or the in-app option. The default option is in-app deployment.

### Hybrid deployment

Store Commerce is a shell that connects to Headless Commerce and Commerce headquarters by using CSU in online mode. In hybrid mode, Store Commerce renders the Cloud POS UI that is hosted in the CSU. When the Store Commerce app is opened, it prompts for the Cloud POS URL.

![Active Store Commerce dialog box prompting for the Cloud POS URL.](../media/SC-Hybrid.png)

To update Store Commerce, update the CSU to update Store Commerce automatically. Because updates are centrally managed in CSU, they don't have to be managed at individual registers. The Store Commerce application shell must still be updated separately by using the installer. For more information about how to update the CSU, see [Apply updates and extensions to Commerce Scale Unit (cloud)](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/update-retail-channel.md). 

## Store Commerce and MPOS parity

Store Commerce has full functional parity with MPOS. For more information about the different POS applications and topologies, see [Choose between Store Commerce app and Store Commerce for web](../mpos-or-cpos.md).

## Hardware parity between MPOS and Store Commerce

The Store Commerce app doesn't support Universal Windows Platform (UWP) peripherals that are [Point of Service devices](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/pos-get-started). If you're currently using a Universal Serial Bus (USB) scanner or magnetic stripe reader in plug-and-play mode, you must install OLE for Retail POS (OPOS) drivers and configure these devices in your hardware profile so they work with the Store Commerce app. For more information about Store Commerce peripheral support, see [Commerce peripherals](../retail-peripherals-overview.md).

For guidance on migrating from MPOS to Store Commerce, see [Migrate Modern POS to Store Commerce](pos-extension/migrate-mpos-store-commerce.md).

## Store Commerce and Store Commerce for web parity

Store Commerce has full functional parity with Store Commerce for web. In addition, Store Commerce supports dedicated hardware station and offline deployment.

## MPOS and Hybrid app roadmap

The Store Commerce apps for Windows and mobile platforms are the next generation of POS applications for Dynamics 365 Commerce. Microsoft deprecated MPOS and the [Retail hybrid apps](hybridapp.md) in October 2023, and recommends that you use Store Commerce or Store Commerce for web for all new deployments. Existing customers should plan to migrate MPOS to Store Commerce.

- .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.16 or later, which is used by the Store Commerce app for UI rendering. 

### Device setup in Commerce headquarters

For Store Commerce, an application type named **Store Commerce** was added on the **Devices** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> POS setup \> Devices**). Select this application type when you create a device for Store Commerce.

If the **Store Commerce** application type doesn't appear on the drop-down menu, try to run the **Initialize** function from the **General** tab of the **Commerce parameters** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Parameters \> Commerce parameters**). Then refresh the page.

You must create a [register](../tasks/create-associate-registers.md) and a [device](../tasks/create-associate-device.md) for Store Commerce. Then, before you activate the app, run the register job from the distribution schedule in Commerce headquarters. During device creation, set the **Application type** field to **Store Commerce**.

### Device installation

Store Commerce can be downloaded from the [LCS Shared asset library](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2/SharedAssetLibrary). On the **Shared asset library** page, select **Retail Self-service package** as the asset type, and then find the file that ends with **Store Commerce**. After the file is downloaded, follow these steps to install the app.

1. Go to the folder where you downloaded Store Commerce, and open PowerShell in administrator mode.
1. In PowerShell, find the Store Commerce installer, and pass the **install** parameter to install the app. To install offline components, pass the `--installoffline` parameter. (For example, enter `Store_Commerce Installer_exe_name install --installoffline`.) If you want to enable debugging mode during installation, pass the `--enablewebviewdevtools` parameter. 

### Store Commerce installation parameters

You can also use the **help** command in PowerShell to find information about all the parameters. In PowerShell, find the Store Commerce installer, and then enter `Store_Commerce Installer_exe_name help install`.
