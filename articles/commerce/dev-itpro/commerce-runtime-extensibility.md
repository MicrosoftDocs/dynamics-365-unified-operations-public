# Commerce runtime (CRT) and Retail Server extensibility

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes various ways that you can extend the commerce runtime (CRT) and create a new Retail Server API. It explains the concept of extension properties, and shows how to add them to a CRT entity both with and without persistence.

CRT contains the core business logic. If you want to add or modify any business logic, you should customize CRT. All the CRT code is developed by using C#, and then it's compiled and released as class libraries (.NET assemblies). Point of sale (POS) is a thin client. All the business logic is done in CRT. POS calls CRT to perform any business logic, and CRT processes the information and then sends it back to POS.

Every CRT service consists of a group of one or more requests and responses. POS sends a request to Retail Server, and Retail Server calls CRT. CRT then processes the request and sends back the response.

For example, the Customer service in CRT contains all the customer-related requests and responses, each of which is run in a different flow. Likewise, the Product service in CRT contain all the product-related requests and responses. The following table shows the requests in the Customer service.

| Request                                      | Purpose                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SaveCustomerServiceRequest                   | This request is called when you save a customer from POS.                        |
| GetCustomersServiceRequest                   | This request is used to get the details of the selected customer.                |
| CustomersSearchServiceRequest                | This request is run when you do a customer search from POS.                      |
| GetCustomerGroupsServiceRequest              | This request is used to get the details of the customer group.                   |
| InitiateLinkToExistingCustomerServiceRequest | This internal request is for backward compatibility.                             |
| FinalizeLinkToExistingCustomerServiceRequest | This internal request is for backward compatibility.                             |
| UnlinkFromExistingCustomerServiceRequest     | This internal request is for backward compatibility.                             |
| GetCustomerBalanceServiceRequest             | This request gets the balance for the customer account.                          |
| GetOrderHistoryServiceRequest                | This request gets the customer's order history.                                  |
| GetPurchaseHistoryServiceRequest             | This request gets the history of the customer's recent purchases.                |
| CustomerSearchByFieldsServiceRequest         | This request is run when you search for customers by using fields (hint search). |
| GetCustomerSearchFieldsServiceRequest        | This request gets the list of customer search fields (hint fields).              |

## CRT extension patterns

Before you learn about the CRT extension patterns, you should understand how a CRT extension can be created. CRT is just a collection of C# class libraries (.NET assemblies). You can create a class library project in C# and do all the CRT extension by using the patterns that are shown in the following table. Always use the samples that Microsoft provides as template for your extension, because these samples have the correct assembly references, Microsoft .NET Framework version, output type, and build parameters. Additionally, all the other required parameters are preconfigured. You can find the CRT sample extension in the Retail software development kit (SDK), at â€¦\\RetailSDK\\SampleExtensions\\CommerceRuntime.

### Create a new CRT service

Create a new functionality/feature.

### Override existing Service

You can completely override existing functionality or customize it according to your business flow. Here are some examples:

+ You want to override the POS search functionality to search from an external system instead of searching in a local database or HQ. Alternatively, you can do an override, call the standard functionality, and do some additional custom logic.
+ Search for a customer in a local database or HQ, and in an external system, and then finally merge or modify the result.
+ Avoid overriding the handler. You can implement most of the CRT extension scenarios by using pre or post triggers. Overriding is required only when you want to completely replace the existing functionality.</li>

### Triggers

You can execute additional logic before or after any request.

In the pre-trigger, you can do some validation, custom logic, and so on.

In the post-trigger, you can add some custom information to the request and send it to POS. Alternatively, you can modify the result that is returned from the standard functionality or do some additional business logic.

### Extension properties

You can add custom properties to any CRT entity and send it to POS. Extension properties are key-value pairs. If you set an extension property in POS, it will be available in CRT. Likewise, if you set an extension property in CRT, it will be available in POS. You can also set extension properties at the level of the request, the response, or the request context. By default, extension properties aren't stored in and read from the database. To read or set extension properties, you must write custom code. However, that custom code is automatically sent between POS and CRT.

For example, you want to capture and show some additional information to the customer entity in POS. In this case, you can add a post-trigger to fetch all your custom properties for customer, add them to the customer entity as extension properties, and send those extension properties to POS.

You can also send extension properties from POS to CRT and store them in your custom table. Alternatively, you can do some custom logic based on those properties, or send it to HQ.

All CRT entities, such as products, customers, transactions, and parameters, support extension properties.

> [!NOTE]
> Attributes are also supported (configuration-driven development). For extension properties, you must create a custom table and store the data. However, attributes are configuration-driven and aren't required in order to create table fields. Therefore, no code is required for read and update operations.

For details about the attributes, see the following topics:

+ [Order attributes](order-attributes.md)
+ [Customer attributes](customer-attributes.md)

### Real-time transaction service calls

You can do synchronous call from CRT to HQ.

### CRT data service and data service with entity

Data service to read data/entity from channel database.

> [!NOTE]
> CRT extension code should not refer to or use any of the CRT business logic classes, methods, or handlers (such as classes from Runtime.Workflow, Runtime.Services, or Runtime.DataServices). These classes are not backward compatible, which could break extensions during an upgrade. Extensions should only use request, response, and entity classes from Runtime.*.Messages, Runtime.Framework, Runtime.Data, and Runtime.Entities.

## Register the CRT extension

### Online

For online (when POS is connected to Retail Server), after extending CRT, put the extension library in the **\\RetailServer\\webroot\\bin\\Ext** folder. Update the **composition** section in the **CommerceRuntime.Ext.config** file with the custom library information, as shown in the following example.

```xml
<add source="assembly" value="your custom library name" />
```

For example, if the name of your custom library is **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.CustomerSearchSample**, add the following line in the **composition** section.

```xml
<add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.CustomerSearchSample" />
```

### Offline

For offline, after extending CRT, put the custom library in the **\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics 365\\70\\Retail Modern POS\\ClientBroker\\ext** folder. Update the **composition** section in the **CommerceRuntime.MPOSOffline.ext.config** file with the custom library information, as shown in the following example.

```xml
<add source="assembly" value="your custom library name" />.
```

## Register the extension configuration in the CommerceRuntime.Ext.config file

Your extension can register any key-value configurations in the **CommerceRuntime.Ext.config** file in the **\<settings\>** node.

This **\<settings\>** node is a key-value pair collection used to configure the CommerceRuntime components. The convention is to prefix settings keys to represent the functional area they are configuring using a period (.) as separator. Extension configuration values MUST be prefixed with **ext**, because the Commerce Runtime initialization enforces this convention and will not load otherwise. Additional prefixes can be added to represent the sub-area they control. The following example sets a key-value pair.

```xml
      <add name="ext.SalesTransaction.Storage.CartSerializationFormat" value="XML" />
```

For HTTP binding timeouts on Realtime Service calls, configure the timeout in seconds per method. This timeout value is limited by **maxExtensionTimeoutInSeconds**, which set in **CommerceRuntime.config**.

```xml
<add name="ext.RealTimeServiceClient.TimeoutInSeconds.InvokeExtensionMethod.ContosoRetailStoreHours_UpdateStoreHours" value="300" />
```

To read the key-value from the CRT extension config, extension code can use **RequestContext.Runtime.Configuration**. The following example shows how to retrieve a value.

```csharp
 string key = context.Runtime.Configuration.GetSettingValue("ext.SalesTransaction.Storage.CartSerializationFormat") ?? string.Empty;
```

The preceding steps are used for manual deployment and testing in your development box. To package the extension and deploy it to production or user acceptance testing (UAT), use the information in the packaging document.

## Debugging CRT

### Attach online

To debug CRT from POS, you should attach the CRT extension project to **w3wp.exe** (the IIS process for Retail Server) when POS is connected to Retail server.

### Attach offline

For offline, attach the CRT extension project to the **dllhost.exe** process.

## Using extension properties on CRT entities, requests, and responses

One way to add new data to an existing CRT entity is to use extension properties. Extension properties are key-value pairs on the entity. By default, these key-value pairs aren't persisted in the database. To persist an extension property, you must write custom code.

## Using extension properties on CRT entities with persistence

Any extension property that you add to an entity stays in memory for POS and CRT for the lifetime of either the object or the transaction, depending on the scenario. The extension property also travels across application boundaries. For example, if you add an extension property in Retail Modern POS and then call Retail Server or CRT, the key-value pair is available during the whole flow. Additionally, if that entity is sent to during a call to Commerce Data Exchange: Real-time Service, the key-value pair is available during the process.

> [!NOTE]
> For HQ, extension properties are sent only for customers and orders.

However, as mentioned earlier, the extension property isn't persisted by default. If you want to persist an extension property, you must do data modeling to help guarantee that you make the correct design choices about where the data should reside. We recommend that you use a new table and a join. This approach fits most requirements well. The **EmailPreference** sample in the Retail SDK provides a good end-to-end example.

**Location of the sample code in the Retail SDK**

â€¦\\RetailSDK\\SampleExtensions\\CommerceRuntime\\Extensions.EmailPreferenceSample

**Location of the scripts**

â€¦\\RetailSDK\\Documents\\SampleExtensionsInstructions\\EmailPreference

**Syntax to set an extension property on an entity**

```csharp
public virtual void SetProperty(string key, object value);
entity.SetProperty("key", value);
```

**Example**

**Scenario**

A new extension table and fields created for the Customer entity and extension need to read those fields from the extension table and send them to POS.

When you extend the channel database, it's always a good idea to include the primary key from the main table in the extension table. That is, don't have a direct relation, and then read the data from the extension table by using the primary key.

**Steps**

1. Create the extension table for the **Customer** entity in the channel database extension schema that has the primary key of the main table.
2. Identify the CRT data request that reads the **Customer** entity.
3. Add a post-trigger for the data request. You will then be able to use the primary key of the **Customer** table to query your extension table to read the custom fields.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can get the primary key for the entity in the post-trigger request. That request will have the entity object, and that entity object will have all the required fields.

4. Add the custom fields as extension properties to the shared parameters entity in the CRT post-trigger, and send it to POS.

## Reading extension properties in triggers

The request that reads the data from the Customer table is GetCustomerDataRequest. The following example shows how you can add a post-trigger for this request.

```csharp
namespace Contoso
{
    namespace Commerce.Runtime.EmailPreferenceSample
    {
        using System;
        using System.Collections.Generic;
        using System.Threading.Tasks;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Data;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataModel;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataServices.Messages;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages;

        /// <summary>
        /// Class that implements a post trigger for the GetCustomerDataRequest request type.
        /// </summary>
        public class GetCustomerTriggers : IRequestTriggerAsync
        {
            /// <summary>
            /// Gets the supported requests for this trigger.
            /// </summary>
            public IEnumerable<Type> SupportedRequestTypes
            {
                get
                {
                    return new[] { typeof(GetCustomerDataRequest) };
                }
            }

            /// <summary>
            /// Post trigger code to retrieve extension properties.
            /// </summary>
            /// <param name="request">The request.</param>
            /// <param name="response">The response.</param>
            public async Task OnExecuted(Request request, Response response)
            {
                ThrowIf.Null(request, "request");
                ThrowIf.Null(response, "response");

                var customer = ((SingleEntityDataServiceResponse<Customer>)response).Entity;

                if (customer == null)
                {
                    return;
                }

                var query = new SqlPagedQuery(QueryResultSettings.SingleRecord)
                {
                    DatabaseSchema = "ext",
                    Select = new ColumnSet(new string[] { "EMAILOPTIN" }),
                    From = "CUSTOMEREXTENSIONVIEW",
                    Where = "ACCOUNTNUM = @accountNum AND DATAAREAID = @dataAreaId"
                };

                query.Parameters["@accountNum"] = customer.AccountNumber;
                query.Parameters["@dataAreaId"] = request.RequestContext.GetChannelConfiguration().InventLocationDataAreaId;
                using (var databaseContext = new DatabaseContext(request.RequestContext))
                {
                    var extensionsResponse = await databaseContext.ReadEntityAsync<ExtensionsEntity>(query).ConfigureAwait(false);
                    ExtensionsEntity extensions = extensionsResponse.FirstOrDefault();

                    var emailOptIn = extensions != null ? extensions.GetProperty("EMAILOPTIN") : null;
                    if (emailOptIn != null)
                    {
                        customer.SetProperty("EMAILOPTIN", emailOptIn);
                    }
                }
            }

            /// <summary>
            /// Pre trigger code.
            /// </summary>
            /// <param name="request">The request.</param>
            public async Task OnExecuting(Request request)
            {
                // It's only stub to handle async signature.
                await Task.CompletedTask;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must change this query, based on your new field and table, or whatever condition you're using. When you design the table, make sure that you have the primary key field from the parent table, so that you can query it by using the CRT entity. Most CRT entities should have the primary key field in them, such as the **RecId** field or another relevant unique field that is used to select the record.

## Saving extension properties by overriding the handler

**Scenario**

You created a new extension table for Customer. When values for the extension field for customer come from POS or CRT, you want to store the values in your custom table.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set extension properties either in a trigger or by overriding the handler. If you just set some extension properties by reading from your extension table, you can use triggers.

**Steps**

1. Create your extension table for Customers in the channel table that has the primary key relation to the main table. (In this case, the main table is **CustTable**.)
2. Identify the CRT data request that sets data in **CustTable**.
3. Override the handler, and call the base request to set values in the main table (**CustTable**) and then the extension table.

> [!NOTE]
> Extension code can pass additional properties required for the extension procedure or view. Extension properties can be saved in the CRT pre or post triggers, you no not need to override the CRT handler. Avoid overriding the handler, most of the CRT extension scenarios can be achieved in pre or post trigger.

The example that follows doesn't have the SQL scripts that are used. You can find the full sample code and scripts at the following locations in the Retail SDK.

**Example**

```csharp
namespace Contoso
{
    namespace Commerce.Runtime.EmailPreferenceSample
    {
        using System.Threading.Tasks;
        using System.Transactions;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Data;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataModel;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataServices.Messages;
        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages;

        /// <summary>
        /// Create or update customer data request handler.
        /// </summary>
        public sealed class CreateOrUpdateCustomerDataRequestHandler : SingleAsyncRequestHandler<CreateOrUpdateCustomerDataRequest>
        {
            /// <summary>
            /// Executes the workflow to create or update a customer.
            /// </summary>
            /// <param name="request">The request.</param>
            /// <returns>The response.</returns>
            protected override async Task<Response> Process(CreateOrUpdateCustomerDataRequest request)
            {
                ThrowIf.Null(request, "request");

                using (var databaseContext = new DatabaseContext(request.RequestContext))
                using (var transactionScope = new TransactionScope())
                {
                    // Execute original functionality to save the customer.
                    var requestHandler = new Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataServices.SqlServer.CustomerSqlServerDataService();
                    var response = (SingleEntityDataServiceResponse<Customer>)requestHandler.Execute(request);

                    // Execute additional functionality to save the customer's extension properties.
                    if (!request.Customer.ExtensionProperties.IsNullOrEmpty())
                    {
                        // The stored procedure will determine which extension properties are saved to which tables.
                        ParameterSet parameters = new ParameterSet();
                        parameters["@TVP_EXTENSIONPROPERTIESTABLETYPE"] = new ExtensionPropertiesExtTableType(request.Customer.RecordId, request.Customer.ExtensionProperties).DataTable;
                        await databaseContext.ExecuteStoredProcedureNonQueryAsync("[ext].UPDATECUSTOMEREXTENSIONPROPERTIES", parameters, resultSettings: null).ConfigureAwait(false);
                    }

                    transactionScope.Complete();

                    return response;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Syntax to enable the property to be read later**

```C#
var property = entity.GetProperty("EXTENSION_PROPERTY_ADDED");
```

## Using extension properties on CRT request and response types

Like entities, request and response types can be extended to set and get extension properties. However, they will persist only for the lifecycle of the request and won't be available in POS. If you want to save them to the database, you must write custom code.

```C#
request.SetProperty("PropertyName", true);
response.SetProperty("PropertyName2", true);
var PropertyName = request.GetProperty("PropertyName");
var BoolPropertyName2 = response.GetProperty("PropertyName2");
```

**Setting or reading extension properties in POS**

You can set extension properties in POS and send them to CRT by using the POS application programming interfaces (APIs). Alternatively, you can send extension properties at the entity level.

To set an extension property on the cart line, you use SaveExtensionPropertiesOnCartLinesClientRequest. Likewise, for the cart header, you use SaveExtensionPropertiesOnCartClientRequest.

Here is an example.

```C#
let sampleExtensionProperty = <ProxyEntities.CommerceProperty>{
    Key: "sampleExtensionProperty",
    Value: <ProxyEntities.CommercePropertyValue>{
        BooleanValue: false
    }
};
this.context.runtime.executeAsync(new SaveExtensionPropertiesOnCartClientRequest([sampleExtensionProperty]));
```

## Reading the extension property from the cart in POS

```typescript
let getCartRequest: GetCurrentCartClientRequest<GetCurrentCartClientResponse> = new GetCurrentCartClientRequest<GetCurrentCartClientResponse>();
return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(getCartRequest).then((value: ICancelableDataResult<GetCurrentCartClientResponse>) => {
    let cart: Commerce.Proxy.Entities.Cart = (<GetCurrentCartClientResponse>value.data).result;

    // Gets the extension property from the cart.

    let sampleExtensionPropertyValue: boolean;
    if (!ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(cart) && !ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(cart.ExtensionProperties)) {
        let SampleCommerceProperties: ProxyEntities.CommerceProperty[] = cart.ExtensionProperties.filter((extensionProperty: ProxyEntities.CommerceProperty) => {
            return extensionProperty.Key === "sampleExtensionProperty";
        });
        sampleExtensionPropertyValue = SampleCommerceProperties.length > 0 ? SampleCommerceProperties[0].Value.BooleanValue : false;
    } else {
        sampleExtensionPropertyValue = false;
    }

    //Resolve the promise according to your scenario and method.

    return Promise.resolve({ canceled: false });
});
```

Likewise, you can read the extension property from all the other entities, such as products, customers, and addresses.

## Implementing a new CRT service that handles multiple new requests

It's a typical case to implement a new CRT service. First, you must create new request and response classes.

## Creating the request and response classes

For serialization to work, the new request type must implement the **\[DataContract\]** and **\[DataMember\]** attributes.

```C#
using System.Runtime.Serialization;
using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages;

[DataContract]
public sealed class GetStoreHoursDataRequest : Request
{
    public GetStoreHoursDataRequest(string storeNumber)
    {
        this.StoreNumber = storeNumber;
    }

    [DataMember]
    public string StoreNumber { get; private set; }
}
```

The new response type resembles the request type.

```C#
[DataContract]
public sealed class GetStoreHoursDataResponse : Response
{
    public GetStoreHoursDataResponse(PagedResult dayHours)
    {
        this.DayHours = dayHours;
    }

    [DataMember]
    public PagedResult DayHours { get; private set; }
}
```

Next, you must create a new CRT service that uses the request and response types.

## Creating a new CRT service

1. Implement the new service.

    ```typescript
    public class StoreHoursDataService : IRequestHandlerAsync
    ```

2. Implement two members of the interface. The **SupportedRequestTypes** member returns a list of all requests that this service can handle. The **execute** method is the method that the CRT calls for you if a request for this service is run.

  ```C#
   public IEnumerable<Type> SupportedRequestTypes
            {
                get
                {
                    return new[] 
                    {
                        typeof(GetStoreHoursDataRequest),
                     };
                }
            }

    public async Task<Response> Execute(Request request)
            {
                if (request == null)
                {
                    throw new ArgumentNullException("request");
                }

                Type reqType = request.GetType();
                if (reqType == typeof(GetStoreHoursDataRequest))
                {
                    return await this.GetStoreDayHoursAsync((GetStoreHoursDataRequest)request).ConfigureAwait(false);
                }
                else
                {
                    string message = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "Request '{0}' is not supported.", reqType);
                    Console.WriteLine(message);
                    throw new NotSupportedException(message);
                }
            }

            private async Task<Response> GetStoreDayHoursAsync(GetStoreHoursDataRequest request)
            {
                ThrowIf.Null(request, "request");

                using (DatabaseContext databaseContext = new DatabaseContext(request.RequestContext))
                {
                    var query = new SqlPagedQuery(request.QueryResultSettings)
                    {
                        DatabaseSchema = "ext",
                        Select = new ColumnSet("DAY", "OPENTIME", "CLOSINGTIME", "RECID"),
                        From = "CONTOSORETAILSTOREHOURSVIEW",
                        Where = "STORENUMBER = @storeNumber",
                    };

                    query.Parameters["@storeNumber"] = request.StoreNumber;
                    return new GetStoreHoursDataResponse(await databaseContext.ReadEntityAsync<DataModel.StoreDayHours>(query).ConfigureAwait(false));
                }
            }
    ```

3. Register the CRT extension as mentioned in the beginning of this topic.

## Implementing a new CRT service that handles a single new request

Itâ€™s slightly easier to create a single-request service.

```C#
public class CrossLoyaltyCardService : SingleAsyncRequestHandler<GetCrossLoyaltyCardRequest>
```

Registration is done as described in the previous procedure.

## Implementing a new CRT service that overrides the functionality of an existing request

In some cases, the request and response types are sufficient, but the service implementation must be changed. If some new data must be transmitted, you can also extend entity, request, or response objects by using extension properties. In this scenario, you can create the service as described earlier and use the existing IRequestHandler types. Additionally, registration in the commerceRuntime.Config file must precede registration of the service that should be overridden. This registration order is important because of the way that the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) loads the extension dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The types that are higher in the file win.

## Implementing a new CRT entity and using it in new CRT service

Any new entity must be of the **CommerceEntity** type. When you use this type, lots of low-level functionality is automatically handled for you. The following example, which is taken from the StoreHours sample, shows how to create an entity that is bound to the database table. This is the usual case.

```C#
public class StoreDayHours : CommerceEntity
{
    private const string DayColumn = "DAY";
    private const string OpenTimeColumn = "OPENTIME";
    private const string CloseTimeColumn = "CLOSINGTIME";
    private const string IdColumn = "RECID";

    public StoreDayHours()
        : base("StoreDayHours")
    {
    }

    [DataMember]
    [Column(DayColumn)]
    public int DayOfWeek
    {
        get { return (int)this[DayColumn]; }
        set { this[DayColumn] = value; }
    }

    [DataMember]
    [Column(OpenTimeColumn)]
    public int OpenTime
    {
        get { return (int)this[OpenTimeColumn]; }
        set { this[OpenTimeColumn] = value; }
    }

    [DataMember]
    [Column(CloseTimeColumn)]
    public int CloseTime
    {
        get { return (int)this[CloseTimeColumn]; }
        set { this[CloseTimeColumn] = value; }
    }

    [Key]
    [DataMember]
    [Column(IdColumn)]
    public long Id
    {
        get { return (long)this[IdColumn]; }
        set { this[IdColumn] = value; }
    }
}
```

When you want to use the new entity in a service, the process is straightforward. As described earlier, you create a new service as a derived IRequestHandler. Then either use or return the new entity. The following example shows how to read the entity from the database and return it as part of the response.

```C#
   private async Task<Response> GetStoreDayHoursAsync(GetStoreHoursDataRequest request)
            {
                ThrowIf.Null(request, "request");

                using (DatabaseContext databaseContext = new DatabaseContext(request.RequestContext))
                {
                    var query = new SqlPagedQuery(request.QueryResultSettings)
                    {
                        DatabaseSchema = "ext",
                        Select = new ColumnSet("DAY", "OPENTIME", "CLOSINGTIME", "RECID"),
                        From = "CONTOSORETAILSTOREHOURSVIEW",
                        Where = "STORENUMBER = @storeNumber",
                    };

                    query.Parameters["@storeNumber"] = request.StoreNumber;
                    return new GetStoreHoursDataResponse(await databaseContext.ReadEntityAsync<DataModel.StoreDayHours>(query).ConfigureAwait(false));
                }
            }
```

For the preceding example, the CRT runtime engine automatically makes a query to the channel database via the registered data adapter. It queries a type that has the name **crt.ISVRetailStoreHoursView**, and generates a **where** clause and columns as specified in the code. The customizer is responsible for providing the SQL objects as part of the customization.
