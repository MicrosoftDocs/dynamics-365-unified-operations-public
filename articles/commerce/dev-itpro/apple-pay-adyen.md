# Set up Apple Pay with Adyen in Dynamics 365 Commerce

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to set up Apple Pay with Adyen in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Key terms

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| Apple Pay | Also known as the Apple Pay "button", Apple Pay is a wallet payment offering that's supported through the Adyen connector. It enables the customer experience and integration that are supported by the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Apple Pay Connector. |
| Wallet | A payment type that doesn't include traditional payment characteristics, such as the Bank Identification Number (BIN) range and expiration date that are used to differentiate credit and debit card types. |

Dynamics 365 Commerce offers an out-of-box integration for Apple Pay when the Adyen payment gateway service is used. Apple Pay is a digital wallet payment method that uses an Apple Pay merchant account in coordination with the Adyen payment service. When it's configured, the Apple Pay button is a selectable payment method that's part of an online store's order checkout page. The Apple Pay button is presented as a payment option only for supported Apple Pay devices. When users select **Apple Pay** on a supported browser or device, they're directed to the Apple Pay service to complete their payment directly. They're then returned to the online storefront for order completion.

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Apple Pay connector reference is used in addition to the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen to enable Apple Pay and credit card payments on a site. Apple Pay can also be configured for use in stores that have Adyen payment terminals that use the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen with the Commerce point of sale (POS). In this case, the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen handles the Apple Payment device tap through the terminal.

## Prerequisites

An Apple merchant account is required to use Apple Pay with Adyen in Commerce. For information about how to set up Apple Pay in your test customer area, see [Apple Pay Drop-in integration](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in#set-up-apple-pay). For information about what to do when you're ready to go live in your production environment, see [Going live](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in#going-live).

The Apple Pay payment method must also be integrated with your Adyen account. Adyen can help you set up the payment method and can also help ensure that the domains that you'll use the certificate for are assigned for use with the certificate.

To enable the enhanced wallet feature flag in Commerce headquarters, go to **Workspaces \> Feature management**, and search for the **Enhanced wallet support and payment improvements** feature. Select the feature, and then select **Enable**. After the feature has been enabled, run the **1110** distribution schedule to make the change available in all channels.

## Map the Apple Pay payment method

Apple Pay is a digital wallet payment method. For information about how to set up payment mapping for Apple Pay, see [Wallet payment support](../wallets.md).

To map the Apple Pay payment method in Commerce headquarters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Payment methods \> Card types**.
1. Select **New** to add a line for Apple Pay, and set the following values:

    - **ID:** ApplePay
    - **Electronic payment name:** Apple Pay
    - **Type:** Wallet
    - **Issuer:** Apple

1. Select **Processor mapping** to open the **Processor payment mapping methods** dialog box. The **Unmapped Processor Payment Methods** column lists the supported payment methods for each available connector (Adyen, PayPal, and Apple).
1. Map the supported payment methods that you want for both the **Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen** connector (for use at the POS) and the **Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Apple Pay** connector (for the online channel).
1. For each mapping line, in the **Unmapped Processor Payment Methods** column, select the line to support, and then select **Add** to move the selections to the **Mapped Processor Payment Methods** column.
1. Select **OK**, and then, on the **Card Types** page, select **Save**.

## Set up the Apple Pay certificate for your site

For each site, you must upload the domain association file (also known as the Apple Pay certificate) as described in the [Adyen Apple Pay documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in#going-live). You can use Commerce site builder to upload the domain association file to the Media Library for your site.

To set up the Apple Pay certificate in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Download the certificate (domain association file) from [Adyen](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in#going-live).
1. Add the .txt extension to the domain association file.
1. In site builder, [upload](../upload-serve-static-files.md) the domain association file to your site's Media Library.
1. Go to **URLs**.
1. Select **New \> New URL**.
1. In the **New URL** dialog box, select **Media Library asset**.
1. In the **URL path** field, enter the URL path (if it isn't already entered). After the domain base URL, enter the following required Apple string: `<domain>/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association.txt`.
1. Select **Next**. The Media Library shows all uploaded media assets of the **document** (.txt) type.
1. Select the domain association file that should be served for requests to the URL that you defined earlier.
1. Select **Create**.

At this point, the URL that you created is in a draft state. Publish the URL to complete the process. The file that the URL points to won't be returned until you publish the URL.

## Configure a Commerce online store for Apple Pay

### Configure content security policies in site builder

Before you configure your fragments or pages to use Apple Pay, you must ensure that your content security policies (CSPs) are configured in Commerce site builder for your site.

To configure content security policies in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Site Settings \> Extensions**.
1. On the **Content security policy** tab, select **Add** to add a line that has `https://applepay.cdn-apple.com/jsapi/v1/apple-pay-sdk.js` to the **child-src**, **connect-src**, **frame-src**, **img-src**, **script-src**, and **style-src** sections.
1. When you've finished, select **Save and publish** to commit the changes.

### Set up Apple Pay as a checkout payment option

To set up Apple Pay as a checkout payment option on your site's (non-express) checkout page, follow these steps.

1. In site builder, go to **Fragments**, and select your site's checkout fragment.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. In the **Checkout section container** slot, select the ellipsis (**...**), and then select **Add module**.
1. In the **Select modules** dialog box, select the **Apple Pay** module, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Finish editing** to check in the fragment, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

Settings for the **Apple Pay** module are built into the module and connect with the configured Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Apple Pay connector that's set up for the online channel in Commerce headquarters.

### Apple Pay payment behavior

The **Apple Pay** payment button is shown only on supported Apple Pay devices (iPhones, iPads, and Safari browsers that support Apple Pay). If a user isn't using one of these devices, the **Apple Pay** payment button is hidden from view.

When a user selects the **Apple Pay** payment button, an **Apple Pay** dialog box appears. There, the user can authenticate against their Apple Pay device or browser. The **Apple Pay** dialog box shows a summary of the order amount and the payment method that the user has configured against their Apple Wallet. The user can review these details and then select **Pay** to complete the payment. After the payment is completed, the user is directed to the **Order Complete** site page that shows a detailed order summary for the completed transaction.

## Configure Commerce POS for Apple Pay

The POS configuration uses the configuration of the hardware profile's **EFT service** field for the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen. In Commerce headquarters, configure the EFT service for Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen as described in [Set up a Dynamics 365 POS hardware profile](adyen-connector-setup.md#set-up-a-dynamics-365-pos-hardware-profile).

Ensure that you add **ApplePay** to the list of tender types in the **Supported Tender Types** field. Use semicolons (;) to separate tender types in the list.

The processor mapping for the Adyen connector will capture the wallet card types that are used by Apple Pay at the POS terminal.
