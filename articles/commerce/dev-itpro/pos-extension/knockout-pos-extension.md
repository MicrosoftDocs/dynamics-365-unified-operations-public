# Use Knockout.js in POS extensions

[!include [banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic shows some basic tasks using **Knockout.js** in POS extensions. It applies to Retail SDK version 10.0.18 and later.

1. Add a NuGet package reference for the **Knockout.js** library to your Pos.Extensions project.
2. Add an MSBuild target to copy the knockout library to your project directory during the build and include it in your package. The Xml is shown in the following example.

    ```XML
    <Target Name="ContentIncludeKnockoutLibrary" BeforeTargets="AssignTargetPaths" DependsOnTargets="RunResolvePackageDependencies">
        <PropertyGroup>
            <KnockoutjsFile>Libraries/knockout.js</KnockoutjsFile>
            <KnockoutLibraryFilePath Condition="'%(PackageDefinitions.Name)' == 'knockoutjs'">%(PackageDefinitions.ResolvedPath)\Content\Scripts\knockout-%(PackageDefinitions.Version).js</KnockoutLibraryFilePath>
        </PropertyGroup>
        <Copy SourceFiles="$(KnockoutLibraryFilePath)" DestinationFiles="$(KnockoutjsFile)" SkipUnchangedFiles="true" /> <!-- Necessary for CPOS -->
        <ItemGroup>
            <Content Include="$(KnockoutjsFile)"></Content>
        </ItemGroup>
    </Target>
    ```

3. Add the knockout library as a dependency in your package’s **manifest.json** file. Update the manifest.json to add a new entry in the **dependencies** array for the Knockout library.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **modulePath** must match the **KnockoutjsFile** variable in the target shown above.

    ```JSON
    "dependencies": [
        {
          "alias": "knockout",
          "format": "amd",
          "modulePath": "Libraries/knockout"
        }
    ]
    ```

4. Update your Pos.Extensions project file to include the Knockout.js type declarations.

    1. Navigate to the knockout official releases.
    2. Download the source code (zip) of the version that was included as a dependency in the manifest.json.
    3. Extract the content of the zip file. The types are located at **<KNOCKOUT_LIBRARY_FOLDER>\build\types\knockout.d.ts**.
    4. Copy the **knockout.d.ts** file to any folder in the extension project.
    5. Update your **tsconfig.json** file to include a **paths** alias for **Knockout.js**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Replace **Libraries/knockout** in the following code example with the relative path to where you copied the **knockout.d.ts** file in the previous step.

        ```JSON
        {
          "extends": "./devDependencies/pos-tsconfig-base.json",
          "compilerOptions": {
            "baseUrl": ".",
            "paths": {
              "knockout": [ "Libraries/knockout" ]
            },
            "noImplicitAny": false
          }
        }
        ```

    6. Include the **knockout.d.ts** file in the project in case it wasn't included automatically and check it in to your source control system.

5. Create an **ApplicationStart** trigger to register the **__posStopExtensionsBinding** handler to prevent collisions between the package’s version of **Knockout.js** and others that might be loaded in POS. An example is available in the [POS extension samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.InStore/tree/release/9.28/src/PosSample/Pos.Extension).

6. Use **Knockout.js** in your extension modules by importing the library as shown in the following code example.

```TypeScript
import ko from "knockout"; // The name of the import 'knockout' must match the one in the tsconfig and manifest file.
```
