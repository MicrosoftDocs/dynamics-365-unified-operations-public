# Point of Sale (POS) extension overview

[!include [banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

A POS application can be extended independently by using the POS extension feature of the Retail SDK. You can modify and create the POS user experience, make out-of-box functional enhancements or modifications, add validations, and add custom features. Using extensions, you can:

+ Extend the POS UI: Add custom columns, app bar buttons, and custom controls depending on the view. The cart view and the welcome screen support configuration using the screen layout designer. Other views can be extended by writing custom code.
+ Override POS business logic: Extend POS business logic to add custom logic by overriding the POS request handlers.
+ Pre- and post-triggers: Add custom logic before or after any POS operation.
+ Consume APIs: POS exposes APIs and UX controls that can be consumed in extension scenarios.
+ Custom UX and APIs: Extend POS to add custom views and APIs to support new functionalities and features.
+ Custom operations: Add custom operations to perform custom functionalities.

These topics explain how to create a POS extension using the independent POS extension model and sealed SDK. This topic applies to Retail software development kit (SDK) version 10.0.18 and later.

## Supported apps

The code base is same for the different POS applications but how the extensions are packaged, deployed, and rendered varies by platform and the app type. Customizations that you develop work across different app types without duplicating or rewriting the code for different apps. There may be some extension components that are app-specific, but most of the extension code can work across apps.

You can create POS extensions for the apps in the following table.

App | Description
---|---
Point of Sale (POS) | POS allows first-line workers, such as cashiers, sales and inventory associates, stock clerks, and store managers to perform various commerce operations. The Dynamics 365 Commerce solution provides different device types to perform these operations across platform and form factors.
Modern-Point of Sale (MPOS) | MPOS is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app that runs on a Windows device. The MPOS client can communicate with peripheral devices, such as cash drawers, credit card readers, and printers, by using Hardware Station.
Cloud Point of Sale (CPOS) | CPOS is a hosted version of the POS that runs in the browser. The CPOS app is deployed in the cloud.
Store Commerce | Store Commerce app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce is a Windows app from the Microsoft Store that runs on a Windows device. The Store Commerce app uses the Chromium engine to render the app. The Chromium engine has better rendering performance than the native JavaScript UWP app in Windows. Store Commerce will replace MPOS when Store Commerce has full functional parity with MPOS. Currently, Store Commerce doesn't support running offline (when there is no connectivity to Retail Server).
iOS hybrid app | The iOS hybrid app is a shell app (wrapper) that runs on an iOS device. The shell hosts CPOS.
Android hybrid app | The Android hybrid app is a shell app that runs on an Android device. The shell hosts CPOS.
