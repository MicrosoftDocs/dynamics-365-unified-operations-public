# Create a Cloud POS extension package

[!include [banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to create a Cloud POS extension package. Based on the Cloud POS deployment topology, the Cloud POS can be deployed to Cloud Scale unit (CSU) or Cloud Scale unit (CSU) – Self hosted.

## Packaging for Cloud Scale unit (CSU) CPOS

The deployment package for CSU can be created by consuming the **Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.ScaleUnit** package.

Follow these steps to create the package:

1. Open Visual Studio 2017, create a new C\# class library project with the **Target framework** set to **.NET Standard 2.0**, and rename the project to **ScaleUnit**.

2. Delete the generated **Class1.cs** file.

3. Add the **Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.ScaleUnit** NuGet package as a dependency to the project.

4. Select the version of the **Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.ScaleUnit** NuGet version to match your SDK/application version. Use the **Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.ScaleUnit** package from `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/commerce-partner/Registry/_packaging/dynamics365-commerce/nuget/v3/index.json`. You can add the package source location to the **nuget.config** file of your extension project file.

5. Add the **POS.Extension** project as a project reference to the **ScaleUnit** project.

6. Compile and build the project. The output of this project contains the CSU deployment package as a zip file.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Commerce Runtime, Retail Server, or a Database extension then you must include all these extension projects as references to the **ScaleUnit** project. Adding them generates a combined deployment package that contains all your extensions.

To deploy, follow the steps in [Deploy the package to CSU](../retail-sdk/retail-sdk-packaging.md#deploy-the-package-to-csu).

## Packaging for Cloud Scale unit – Self hosted CPOS

The deployment package for CSU can be created by consuming the **Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.Installers.ScaleUnit** package.

1. Open Visual Studio 2017, create a new console application (.NET Core), and name it **ScaleUnit.Installer**.

2. Edit the .proj file and change the **Target Framework** to **.NET Framework 4.6.1**. The Xml looks like this:

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
        <PropertyGroup>
            <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
            <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
        </PropertyGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

3. Delete the generated **Program.cs** file.

4. Add a reference to the Installer SDK NuGet Package

    1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer and select **Manage NuGet packages**.
    2. Select the **Browse** tab in the NuGet Package Manager window.
    3. Search for **Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.Installers.ScaleUnit**.
    4. Select the package and then select **Install**.
    5. Select the version that matches your go-live version.

5. Add a reference from the **ScaleUnit.Installer** project to the POS.Extension project created above.

    1. Right-click the **ScaleUnit.Installer** project in the Solution Explorer, select **Add** and then **Reference**.
    2. Select the **Projects** tab on the left side of the Reference Manager.
    3. Select the POS.Extension project created above.

6. Add the **Extension.Config** file to the project.

    1. Right-click the project and select **Add** and then **New Item**.
    2. Select **Application Configuration File**.
    3. Name file as **Extension.Config** and add it.

7. Update the **Extension.Config** file with the Commerce Runtime extensions. If you don’t have any Commerce Runtime extensions, leave the **composition** section empty. The Xml looks like this:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <commerceRuntimeExtensions>
        <composition>
            <add source="assembly" value="CommerceRuntime" />
          </composition>
    ```

8. Compile and build the project. The output of this project contains the **ScaleUnit** installer .exe file.

9. To manually install the extension, open PowerShell in administrator mode and navigate to the extension installer folder. Run the install command to install the extensions.

    ```powershell
    PS C:\ModernPos.Installer\bin\Debug\net461> .\ScaleUnit.Installer.exe install    
    ```

    To uninstall the extension:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\ModernPos.Installer\bin\Debug\net461> .\ ScaleUnit.Installer.exe 
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Before installing the extension installer, install the sealed ScaleUnit. If you have Commerce Runtime, Retail Server, or a Database extension, then you must include all these extension projects as references to the **ScaleUnit.Installer** project. Adding the projects generates a combined deployment package that contains all your extensions.
    > You can also create multiple Scale unit installers by extensions and manage them separately. You don’t have to combine all the extensions in one package.
