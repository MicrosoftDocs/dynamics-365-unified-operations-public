[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Learn how you can manage Bing Maps for your application. When Bing Maps is turned on, people can view a map of a store, warehouse, or other location when creating orders. 

## Enable Bing Maps

1. Go to **Commerce shared Parameters** > **Bing Maps**.
2. Select **Enable Bing Maps** to turn on Bing Maps functionality.

## Enter a Bing Maps key

Go to the [Bing Maps licensing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=390116) for details about how to
obtain a key.

1. Go to **Commerce shared Parameters** > **Bing Maps**.
2. Enter the license key in the **Bing Maps Key** field.

## Privacy notice

If you enable the Bing Maps feature, address information is automatically sent over the internet to the Bing Maps service to display an online map of the address within this application. If you click on Bing Maps within this application, you will be redirected to [www.bing.com/maps](https://www.bing.com/maps). Your use of Bing Maps is also governed by the [Bing Maps End User Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9710837).  
  
Administrators can turn the Bing Maps feature on or off under **Commerce shared Parameters** > **Bing Maps**. Turning the Bing Maps app off makes the feature unavailable in this application.
