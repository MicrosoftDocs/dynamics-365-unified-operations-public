# Install Commerce Scale Unit on a development environment

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to install Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) on virtual hard disk (VHD) local development and cloud development environments for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. 

## Create Azure Active Directory apps

First, you must create two Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) apps, one for CSU and one for the Store Commerce for Web app (formerly CPOS). The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate will be added to this app. For more information, see [Configure Store Commerce for web to use a custom Azure AD app](cpos-custom-aad.md).

## Create an SSL certificate for a website based on the host name

To create an SSL certificate for a website based on the host name, follow these steps.

1. Connect to the development machine using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
1. Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
1. Select **Create a Self-Signed Certificate**.
1. Copy the thumbprint value of the new certificate for use later.

> [!NOTE]
> The SSL certificate you use must contain the following `keyUsage` property values: `digitalSignature`, `keyEncipherment`, and `dataEncipherment`.

## Install IIS components

To install IIS components on the development machine, go to **Server Manager \> Local Server \> Manage \> Add roles and features**. Under **IIS**, confirm that the **Management Tools \> IIS 6 Management Compatibility (IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility)** component is checked.

## Obtain a copy of a previously created SSL certificate to add to the Azure Web App

To obtain a copy of a previously created SSL certificate to add to the Azure Web App, follow these steps.

1. On the development machine, select the Windows logo key + R to open the **Run** dialog box.  
1. Enter "MMC" to open the Microsoft Management Console.  
1. Select **File > Add/Remove Snap-in**.
1. Under **Available snap-ins**, select **Certificates**, and then select **Add**.
1. In the **Certificates snap-in** dialog box, select **Computer Account**, and then select **Next**.
1. Select **Local Computer**, and then select **Finish**. 
1. Select **OK**.  
1. Expand **Certificates \> Personal > Certificates**.  
1. Locate the SSL Certificate you created from IIS in the list, then right-click it and select **All Tasks \> Export**.  
1. In the export dialog box, select **Next**.  
1. Select **No, do not export the private key**, and then select **Next**.  
1. Select **DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)**.  
1. Select the C:\temp folder, and then enter "DevBoxSelfSigned" as the file name.  
1. Select **OK**, and then select **Save**.  
	
## Add SSL certificate to the existing CSU Azure application

To add the SSL certificate to the existing CSU Azure application, follow these steps.

1. In a web browser on the virtual machine (VM), edit the CSU Azure App registration created earlier.
1. For **Client Credentials**, select **Add a certificate or secret**. 
1. Select the **Certificates** tab.
1. Select **Upload Certificate**.
1. From C:\temp, select the **DevBoxSelfSigned** certificate.
1. For **Description**, enter "Devbox cert".
1. For **Set Description**, enter "Devbox Self-signed Certificate".
1. Select **Add**.

1. Select **Run now**.  
1. For each warning, select **Yes**.  
1. Select **OK** to schedule the job.  

## Install sealed CSU prerequisites

Before you can run the Sealed CSU installer, you must complete the following steps. 

### Install .NET Core hosting bundle

To install .NET Core hosting bundle on the development machine, follow these steps.

1. Connect to the development machine using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
1. Open a web browser and go to [Download .NET 6.0 (Linux, macOS, and Windows](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).
1. In the **ASP.Net Core Runtime 6.0.X** section, select the **Hosting Bundle** installer for Windows to download it.
1. Run the **dotnet-hosting-6.0.x-win.exe** installer.

### Download the sealed self-hosted installer to the development machine and copy the configuration file

To download the sealed self-hosted installer to the development machine and copy the configuration file, follow these steps.

1. Open a web browser on the development machine and sign in to [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com).
1. Select your project from the list.
1. From the hamburger menu at the top of the page, select **Asset library**.
1. Select **Retail Self-service package**.  
1. If you already have a sealed CSU installer in your list, select the package name to start the download.  
1. If you donâ€™t have a CSU sealed installer in the list, select **Import**, select the sealed installer version you want to use, select **Pick**, and then select the package name to start the download. 
1. Copy the sealed installer from the **Downloads** folder to C:\temp.

## Install the sealed CSU

The process of installing a sealed CSU usually employs a configuration file downloaded from headquarters that contains all of the information needed for Retail Transaction Service (RTS) authentication. If you don't use a configuration file, then you must specify additional parameters such as `--AadTokenIssuerPrefix`, `--StoreSystemAosURL`, `--StoreSystemChannelDatabaseId`, and `--TenantId`. For a full list of installer commands, see [Mass deployment of sealed Commerce self-service components](enhanced-mass-deployment.md) 

To install the sealed CSU on the development machine, follow these steps.

1. Open a Windows Command Prompt with administrator privileges.
1. Change directory to C:\temp (for example, `CD C:\temp`).
1. Execute the following command.

`CommerceStoreScaleUnitSetup.exe install --port 446 --SSLCertThumbprint "<SSL thumbprint of certificate created earlier>" --RetailServerCertThumbprint "<SSL thumbprint of certificate created earlier>" --AsyncClientCertThumbprint "<SSL thumbprint of certificate created earlier >"  --AsyncClientAADClientID "<CSU Azure APP Client ID>" --RetailServerAADClientID "<CSU Azure APP Client ID>" --CPOSAADClientID "<CPOS Azure APP Client ID>" --RetailServerAADResourceID "<CSU Azure APP Client ID>" --Config "c:\temp\StoreSystemSetup.xml" --SkipSChannelCheck --trustSqlservercertificate`

> [!NOTE]
> Since this is a development machine, using the same SSL thumbprint to run all services is allowed. For production and user acceptance testing (UAT) environments, these values should be different.
> Don't enter port 80 or 443 during installation. Entering either of these values interferes with the application object server (AOS) service that hosts the Commerce headquarters website. 

## Database restores from UAT

If you previously set up a sealed CSU using the steps above and then restored a database from another environment, you must perform the following steps to make the sealed CSU functional again. 

1. Go through the steps in [Update Commerce headquarters](#update-commerce-headquarters) to recreate the records. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > You must use the same values for **Channel Database ID** and **Channel Profile** that you used in the previous installation. If these values are different than the previous installation, you must rerun the installer. 
2. Check your download sessions to see if the jobs are applying. 
    - If the jobs are applying, then your CSU is working and you don't need to rerun the installer steps.
    - If the download jobs aren't applying, first check the Windows Event logs to see if there are any obvious errors, then download a new configuration file from the channel database form and rerun the CSU installer using the new configuration file.  

## Additional steps for cloud (LCS) deployed development environments 

To make the development environment accessible from outside the development VM, you must perform the following additional tasks. 

> [!NOTE]
> External accessible redirection has only been tested with Commerce version 10.0.37 and earlier. Support for this functionality is retired in newer versions with the removal of the legacy (default) Retail Server. 

### Create a channel profile for external access

Create a channel profile for external access, follow these steps.

1. In headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel Setup \> Channel Profiles** and create a new channel profile.
1. Set the following property values: 
    1. For **Retail Server URL**, enter `https://<LCSEnvironmentName>devret.axcloud.dynamics.com/RetailServer/Commerce`.
    1. For **Cloud POS**, enter `https://<LCSEnvironmentName>devret.axcloud.dynamics.com/POS`.	
1. Select **Save**.
1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channels \> Stores \> All Stores**.
1. Edit the store record you normally work with. 
1. Update the **Channel Profile** to the value you created.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Retail and Commerce IT \> Distribution Schedule** and execute the **1070 (Channel configuration)** sync job.
