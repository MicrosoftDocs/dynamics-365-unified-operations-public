# Customer attributes

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

We extended the attribute framework in Headquarters to support attributes for customers, customer orders, cash-and-carry transactions, and call center orders.

> [!NOTE]
> The attributes are read-only. However, in the case of customer or order attributes, you can edit and set values at the level of the individual customer or order.

The new customer attribute framework lets you use configurations to add new fields to the customer master record. Those fields then automatically appear on the **Customer add/edit** or **Customer details** screen in Point of Sale (POS) or Headquarters. After you configure the customer attribute group in the Commerce parameters, POS and Headquarters automatically show the new attribute. No code change or customization is required. You can also use the screen layout designer to configure the customer card on the POS transaction screen so that it shows the customer attributes.

## Why and when you should configure customer attributes

If you want to add new fields to the customer master record, and capture the information in POS or Headquarters, you can use this feature. Previously, to add a new field to the customer master record and show it in POS and Headquarters, you had to create a new extension table in Headquarters and the channel database, and make inline modifications to Commerce runtime (CRT) and POS code. You had to write code in CRT and POS to read/write to the extension fields and show them in POS. You had to handle this in various POS views and scenarios, such as the **Customer details** screen and the **Customer** panel on the transaction screen. In addition, in CRT, you had to handle all insert, select, and update operations. However, the new functionality lets you complete all these steps through configuration so you don't have to write any code or create custom extension tables.

The first version of this functionality doesn't support **datetime** and **reference** attribute types. For those attribute types, you should use extension properties and custom controls to show the details in POS.

## Configure customer attributes in POS and Headquarters
