# Detect abandoned carts and send notifications to customers

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to customize the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce abandoned cart connector sample app to detect abandoned carts and send reminder email notifications to customers.

The ability to recover revenue and retain customers through abandoned cart notifications is an important capability that Dynamics 365 Commerce supports. By customizing the Commerce abandoned cart connector sample app, retailers can access shopping carts on Retail Server that haven't been modified during a time window that the retailers define. Those carts can then be retrieved, augmented with product and customer data, and passed on to a third-party email marketing provider that can generate email notifications and send them customers.

The abandoned cart email notification that customers receive can contain the following information:

- The customer's first name.
- The customer's last name.
- The customer's email address.
- A URL that returns the customer to their cart.
- The transaction currency.
- A list of products in the customer's cart. For each product, the following information is included:

    - The product's display name
    - The product ID (used to assemble a URL to the product description page)
    - A product image that can automatically be resized to accommodate different viewport sizes
    - Alt text for the product image
    - The product's unit price

## Abandoned cart connector sample

A connector model that Microsoft provides through the Retail software development kit (SDK) enables abandoned cart information to be retrieved and sent to a third-party email marketing provider. This connector handles communication with Retail Server, uses Azure Key Vault for security, handles scheduling of cart retrieval for a specified time window, and retrieves order and product data. It also provides a sample implementation for an integration with a third-party email marketing provider. The connector is built to communicate with [Emarsys](https://emarsys.com) out of the box. However, it can easily be customized to integrate with other solutions, such as Constant Contact, Mailchimp, and SendGrid.

The following illustration shows the components of the abandoned cart connector sample app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some regions require that customers be able to opt out of having their cart data passed to an email marketing provider, or request that their data be removed. However, Microsoft doesn't provide these options for customers. Therefore, if you plan to do business in regions that mandate them, you must provide the required infrastructure and customizations to track customers' preferences and, based on them, prevent customer data from being passed to your email platform. You must also define a process for purging customer data from your email marketing provider at the customer's request.

## Obtain the code sample

The abandoned cart connector sample app is included in the Retail SDK as of version 10.0.16. The code can be found under **\\RetailSDK\\Code\\SampleExtensions\\RetailServer\\Extensions.AbandonedCartSample**. For more information about the Retail SDK and where to obtain it, see [Retail software development kit (SDK)](retail-sdk/retail-sdk-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Although the sample code was first made available in version 10.0.16 builds, it's compatible with version 10.0.13 and later builds of Retail Server.

## Prerequisites and dependencies

Before you can deploy and configure the abandoned cart connector sample code, the following prerequisites must be met.

### Access to Commerce resources

To configure and deploy the abandoned cart connector app, you must have access to the following Commerce resources:

- Administrator access to Commerce headquarters for your environment
- Access to the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) project for your environment

### Azure Cosmos DB

The abandoned cart connector app uses Azure Cosmos DB to track the IDs and timestamps of carts that have previously been retrieved. You can use Azure Cosmos DB to persist this data, or you can customize the code sample to integrate with another data storage option. For more information about Azure Cosmos DB, see [Welcome to Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction).

If you use Azure Cosmos DB, the following prerequisites must be met before you can run the sample:

- You must have an active Azure Cosmos DB account. If you don't have an account, see [Create a database account](/azure/cosmos-db/create-sql-api-dotnet#create-a-database-account).
- You must retrieve the **URI** and **PRIMARY KEY** (or **SECONDARY KEY**) values from the **Keys** blade of your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal. For more information about how to retrieve endpoint and key information for your Azure Cosmos DB account, see [View, copy, and regenerate access keys and passwords](/azure/cosmos-db/manage-account#keys).

### Azure Key Vault

The abandoned cart connector app uses Key Vault to store the names and secrets of the different components that require secure access.

To set up a key vault, follow these steps.

1. Follow the instructions in [Manage Key Vault in Azure Stack Hub using the portal](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-key-vault-manage-portal?view=azs-2002&preserve-view=true).
2. Create secrets for the following information:

    - Emarsys application programming interface (API) user name and API secret
    - Abandoned cart application ID and secret

The abandoned cart connector sample code uses Azure default credentials to access Key Vault. You must provide **List** and **Read** permissions to the identity that you plan to use to access Key Vault.

For more information about Azure default credentials, see [DefaultAzureCredential Class](/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-dotnet&preserve-view=true).

## Create an abandoned cart connector sample app application ID for the Azure AD tenant

You must create an abandoned cart connector sample app application ID for the Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. For information about how to create an application ID, see [Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

## Add the abandoned cart connector sample app application ID to the allow list for the Retail Server API

Next, you must add the abandoned cart connector sample app application ID to the allow list for the Retail Server API. For information about how to add an application ID to the allow list in Azure, see [Support for Service to Service authentication in Retail Server](https://community.dynamics.com/ax/b/axforretail/posts/support-for-service-to-service-authentication-in-retail-server).

## Configure the abandoned cart connector sample app

To configure the abandoned cart connector sample app, modify the **appSettings.json** configuration file that is located at the root of the **AbandonedCartDetectionSample** directory. The following tables describe the configuration file properties.

### KeyVaultOptions

| Property    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| KeyVaultURI | The Domain Name System (DNS) name of the key vault that you're using in the Azure portal. |
