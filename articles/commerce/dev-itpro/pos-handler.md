# Override POS request handler

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to override POS request handler. We've introduced an extension pattern for overriding the POS business logic. If you have a scenario where you want to modify/add some business logic to the core POS business flow, then you can follow this pattern.

For example, when you sell a serial item, POS will display a dialog box where you can enter the serial number for that item after the scan. If you want to automate the serial number process by entering the serial number through code, then you can override this serial number request handler and use custom business logic. Most of the business logic in POS is implemented in request handler, however, you can override the relevant request handler and return the response according to your business flow.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all request handler logic is exposed for customization. If you want to customize any business logic and if that request handler is not overridable, then create a support ticket or log a request in the LCS extensibility tool.

**POS request handler logic exposed for overriding**

This list is based on [Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations - Version 7.3.5](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Details?kb=4456209&bugId=235124&qc=9fef9e411bd4f715508205b6c65b16afdc4096cea0f15e1535c3d8e3f13716c1). 

In each monthly update we will be adding additional extension points, so check the Pos.api.d.ts file in the Retail SDK for the full list.

## How to override a handler in POS

If you want to override any of the above POS request handler logic, you to need to use the following steps:

1.  Create a new class and extend it from the corresponding handler class. For example, if you are overriding GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler, then extend your class from GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler.

2.  Implement the executeAsync method.

3.  Either call the default handler or do your custom logic inside the executeAsync method and return the response.

## Step by step instructions

The following example shows how to override the GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler to automate the serial number entry in POS. By default, POS will display a dialog box to enter the serial number if the item is configured to ask for serial number. We want to avoid showing this dialog box and enter serial number through code.

1.  Open Visual Studio 2015 in administrator mode.

2.  Open ModernPOS solution from …\\RetailSDK\\POS.

3.  Under the POS.Extensions project, create a new folder called POSRequestHandlerExtension.

4.  Under the POSRequestHandlerExtension folder, create new folder called Handlers.

5.  In the Handlers folder, add a new .ts (typescript) file and name it GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExt.ts.

6.  Add the following import statement to import the relevant entities and context in the GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExt.ts file.

	 ```typescript
	 import { GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler } from "PosApi/Extend/RequestHandlers/ProductsRequestHandlers";
	 import { GetSerialNumberClientRequest, GetSerialNumberClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Products";
	 import { ClientEntities } from "PosApi/Entities";
	```

7.  In the GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExt.ts file, create a new class called GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExtend and extend it from GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler.

    ```typescript
    export default class GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExt extends GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler { }
	```
	
8.  Implement the executeAsync method inside the GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExt class. In the executeAsync method, you can write your custom logic and return the response or call the default handler. When POS sells the serial item, it will look for executeAsync to execute the logic for the serial number, however because we are overriding it, POS will now execute this overridden executeAsync method instead of the standard method.

	**Sample implementation of how to override the executeAsync method**

	```typescript
	public executeAsync(request: GetSerialNumberClientRequest<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>):
		Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>> {

	// User could implement new business logic here to process the serial number.
	// The following example sets serial number "112233" for product 82001.

	if (request.product.ItemId === "82001") {
	let response: GetSerialNumberClientResponse = new GetSerialNumberClientResponse("112233");
	return Promise.resolve(<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>>{

	canceled: false,
	data: response

	});

	}

	// If you don’t want to execute custom logic on some conditions, and you just want to call the standard logic, you can call the default request, as shown below.

	return this.defaultExecuteAsync(request);

	}
	```

	Full sample code:

	```typescript
	import { GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler } from "PosApi/Extend/RequestHandlers/ProductsRequestHandlers";
	import { GetSerialNumberClientRequest, GetSerialNumberClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Products";
	import { ClientEntities } from "PosApi/Entities";

	/**
	* Override request handler class for getting serial number request.
	*/

	export default class GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExt extends GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandler {

	/**
	* Executes the request handler asynchronously.
	* @param {GetSerialNumberClientRequest<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>} request The request containing the response.
	* @return {Promise<ICancelableDataResult<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>>} The cancelable promise containing the response.
	*/

	public executeAsync(request: GetSerialNumberClientRequest<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>):
		Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>> {

	// User could implement new business logic here to process the serial number.
	// The following example sets serial number "112233" for product 82001.

	if (request.product.ItemId === "82001") {
	let response: GetSerialNumberClientResponse = new GetSerialNumberClientResponse("112233");
	return Promise.resolve(<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetSerialNumberClientResponse>>{
	canceled: false,
	data: response
	});

	}
	return this.defaultExecuteAsync(request);
	}
	}
	```

9.  Create a new json file under the POSRequestHandlerExtension folder. Name it manifest.json.

10.  In the manifest.json file, copy and paste the following code. Be sure to delete the default generated code before copying this code.

		```typescript
		{
		"$schema": "../manifestSchema.json",
		"name": "Pos_Extensibility_Samples",
		"publisher": "Microsoft",
		"version": "7.3.5.0",
		"minimumPosVersion": "7.3.5.0",
		"components": {
		"extend": {
		"requestHandlers": [
		{
		"modulePath": "Handlers/GetSerialNumberClientRequestHandlerExt"
		}
		]
		}
		}
		}
		```
11.  Open the extensions.json file under the POS.Extensions project. Update it with POSRequestHandlerExtension samples, so that POS during runtime will include this extension.
 
		```typescript
		{
		"extensionPackages": [
		   { 
			  "baseUrl": "SampleExtensions2" 
			}, 
			{ 
			  "baseUrl": " SampleExtensions" 
			}, 
			{
			 "baseUrl": "POSRequestHandlerExtension"
			}
		]
		}
		```

		> [!NOTE]
		> The extension.json file should always contain two extensions folder names, so be sure to keep the SampleExtensions folder name or your custom extension folder name. For production, don’t use the sample extensions. You should add your own extension folders and remove all the samples.

12.  Open the tsconfig.json file to comment out the extension package folders from the exclude list. POS will use this file to include or exclude the extension for compilation. By default, the list contains all the excluded extensions list. If you want to compile any extension part of the POS, then you need to add the extension folder name and comment the extension from the extension list, as shown below.

		```typescript
		"exclude": [

		// "SampleExtensions",
		//"SampleExtensions2",
		//"POSRequestHandlerExtension"

		],
		```

13.  Compile and rebuild the project.

## How to test your extension

1.  Press F5 and deploy the POS to test your customization.

2.  After POS launches, sign in to POS and add a serial item to a transaction.

3.  Place a break point in the extension code. When you add the serial item you should be able to debug the extension code.
