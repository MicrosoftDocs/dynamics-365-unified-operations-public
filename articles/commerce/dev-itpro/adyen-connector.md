## Frequently asked questions

### Can I share a payment terminal with multiple hardware stations?

No. Payment terminals can only be used by a single hardware station or POS terminal. Attempting to connect multiple hardware stations to a single payment terminal will result in locking issues. If a payment terminal must be shared by multiple POS devices, an IIS hardware station must be deployed to manage the payment terminal. 

### Can I reuse my existing payment terminal with the Adyen connector?

No. Adyen payment terminals are injected with the Adyen software. Therefore, existing payment terminals that aren't preconfigured with Adyen can't be reused with the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen.

### Do I need a static IP address for the Adyen payment terminal?

Yes. Modern POS requires a known IP address to communicate with the Adyen payment terminal. Although the IP address of the Adyen payment terminal can be changed in the client, attempts to keep up with changing IP addresses involve significant overhead and could cause business disruption.

### Can I use my merchant bank?

Yes. Adyen can work with any merchant bank.

## Troubleshooting

### POS payment terminals

#### General issues

For all general issues, you should always consult the Modern POS or IIS Hardware Station event logs first. You can find these logs found under the following nodes in the Microsoft Windows event log:

- Application and Services Logs \> Microsoft \> Dynamics \> Commerce-ModernPOS
- Application and Services Logs \> Microsoft \> Dynamics \> Commerce-Hardware Station

#### Failing payment transactions

When payment transactions aren't successfully processed through the Adyen payment terminal, the corresponding error messages in the Dynamics 365 POS will contain a PSP reference number(PSP is the reference ID provided by Adyen used to uniquely identify each transaction). Provide this reference number when you contact Adyen support for help with specific transactions.

## Common issues

### POS payment terminals

#### The EFT terminal ID isn't set

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Title</strong></td>
<td>EFT Terminal ID is not set</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Symptom</strong></td>
<td>Payment authorization calls fail, and a hardware error occurs. An error message in the event log indicates that the <strong>EFT Terminal ID</strong> value isn't set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Root cause</strong></td>
<td>This issue can occur when the <strong>EFT POS Register Number</strong> field isn't set on the register or the IIS Hardware Station. It can also occur if the value is set but isn't correctly synced to the POS terminal. Finally, it can also occur when the value is cached.</td>
</tr>
<td><strong>Fix</strong></td>
<td>Follow the instructions in the <a href="#set-up-a-dynamics-365-register">Set up a Dynamics 365 register</a> section earlier in this topic. Then run the <strong>1070</strong> and <strong>1090</strong> distribution schedules. If the issue isn't resolved, consider reactivating Modern POS, because the value of the <strong>EFT POS Register Number</strong> field might be cached and might need to be reset.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

#### The Modern POS or IIS Hardware Station configuration isn't updated

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Title</strong></td>
<td>Config is not updated</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Symptom</strong></td>
<td>Modern POS error: "Sign in Error. The initialization data couldn't be loaded."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Root cause</strong></td>
<td>This issue can occur when the POS is redeployed but the dllhost.config file hasn't been updated.</td>
</tr>
<td><strong>Fix</strong></td>
<td>Follow the instructions in the <a href="#update-the-modern-pos-or-iis-hardware-station-configuration">Update the Modern POS or IIS Hardware Station configuration</a> section earlier in this topic. Then end the dllhost.exe task on the <strong>Details</strong> tab in Task Manager, and reopen Modern POS. If you're using an IIS Hardware Station, reset IIS.</td>
