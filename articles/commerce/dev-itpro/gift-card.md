# Support for external gift cards

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up external gift cards in Retail Modern POS, the call center, and the storefront.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for external gift cards in the call center is new in version 10.0.10. Support for external gift cards in the storefront will be added in a future version. 

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce supports both *internal* and *external* gift cards. Internal gift cards are managed entirely in Dynamics 365 Commerce, whereas external gift cards are administered by a third party. If a retailer's operations are run entirely in Microsoft Dynamics, internal gift cards are sometimes the best solution. For complex enterprises that span multiple countries or regions, and multiple point of sale (POS) systems, it's often best to use a third party to manage gift card balances and enable gift cards to be used across those systems.

Like support for other card payment types, support for external gift cards must be built into the payment connector that is used. The out-of-box payment connector for Adyen supports external gift cards through SVS and Givex in POS, the call center, and the e-commerce storefront.

## External gift card setup

> [!NOTE]
> Some setup steps assume that demo data is used. The steps might vary, depending on the dataset that is used.

### Card types

1. Search for **Card Types**. 
2. Select **New**, add the following values, and then select **Save**.

    | Field name     | Value                  |
    |----------------|------------------------|
    | Card ID        | **EXTGC**              |
    | Card type name | **External Gift Card** |
    | Card types     | **Gift card**          |
    | Card issuer    | Enter any description. |

### Card numbers

1. On the **Card types** page, select the newly created gift card, and then select **Card numbers**.
2. Specify the range of card numbers that should be used for external gift cards, and then select **Save**.

In the following example, if the first four digits of a card number are **6036**, the card will be mapped to the gift card that you set up in the "Card types" section of this topic.

| Field name         | Value |
|--------------------|-------|
| Card number from   | 6000  |
| Card number to     | 6999  |
| Digits to identify | 4     |

### Payment methods

1. Search for **Payment methods** to open the **Payment methods** page.
2. Select **New**, and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Payment method** field, enter **12**.
    2. In the **Payment method name** field, enter **External Gift Card**.
    3. In the **Default function** field, select **Card**.
    4. Select **Save**.

## Store setup

1. Search for **All stores** to open the **All stores** page.
2. Select the **San Francisco** store in the list.
3. On the Action Pane, on the **Set up** tab, in the **Set up** group, select **Payment methods**.
4. Select **New**.
5. In the **Payment method** field, enter **12**. The **Payment method name** and **Function** fields should then be set automatically.
6. On the **General** FastTab, set the following fields:

    - Set the **Operation name** field to **Pay gift card**.
    - Set the **Connector name** field to **TestConnector**.

9. On the **Posting** FastTab, set the **Gift card item number** field to **0010**.

    ![Setting the Gift card item number field](./media/05_02.png)

10. Select **Save**.
11. Select **Card setup**, and then select **New** to map the gift card payment method to the newly created external gift card payment method for the San Francisco store.

## POS setup

1. In Dynamics 365 Commerce Headquarters, search for **Hardware profiles** to open the **POS hardware profile** page.
2. In the left pane, select **Virtual**.
3. Select **Edit**.
4. On the **EFT service** FastTab, in the **Connectors** grid, select the first entry, **TestConnector**.

    ![Adding GiftCard to the list of supported tender types](./media/01.png)

6. Select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also use the **New** button to create multiple payment connectors. In this way, you can take advantage of the support for multiple connectors that has been added to the solution. You can then have different payment connectors for different payment methods. For example, all credit cards can be processed through one connector, but gift cards can be processed through a different connector.

### Update the button grid

1. Go to the **Button grid** page.
2. In the navigation bar on the left side of the page, search for **F2S1M**, and select the filtered option.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Designer** to download the button designer application.
4. When the grid designer appears, right-click on an empty (gray) area, and then select **New button**.

    ![New button](./media/07.png)

5. Right-click the new button, and then select **Button properties**.
6. Set the **Action**, **Payment type**, and **Text on button** properties according to the following matrix.

    | Action            | Payment type       | Text on button        |
    |-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
    | Issue gift card   | External Gift Card | Ext Issue gift card   |
    | Add to gift card  | External Gift Card | Ext Add to gift card  |
    | Gift card balance | External Gift Card | Ext Gift card balance |
    | Pay gift card     | External Gift Card | Ext Pay gift card     |

    When you've finished, your button layout should resemble the following illustration.

    ![Completed button layout](./media/10.png)

7. Close the designer.
8. Search for **Distribution Schedule**.
9. In the navigation bar on the left side of the page, search for **1090**, **1115**, and **1070**.
10. On the Action Pane, select **Run now**.
11. Check the status of the job by searching for **Download sessions**.
12. Wait until **Applied** appears next to all the jobs, and then close the browser.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using Retail Commerce Scale Unit (RCSU) that is located in the store, you need to perform an IIS rest to clear the cache. You can either do this through the IIS application or open an admin Command Prompt window and enter `iisreset`. Otherwise, wait for the RCSU to be updated.

## Update merchant properties

> [!NOTE]
> As of version 10.0.6, this step is no longer required.

1. In File Explorer, go to **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics 365\\70\\Retail Hardware Station\\ConfigurationUtility**.
2. Run the **HardwareStationConfigurationUtility** executable program.
3. Configure the utility by entering the correct Commerce Scale Unit URL, and then select **Install**.
4. To verify that the download was successful, go to **C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\Retail Hardware Station**, and look at the timestamp of the **MerchantInformation.xml** file. It should be very recent.

## Configure and test Modern POS

1. Start the Modern POS (MPOS) application.
2. Sign in by using the standard credentials.
3. When you're prompted, select **Perform a non-drawer operation**.
4. On the main screen, select **Select hardware station**.
5. On the bar on the right side of the page, select **Manage**.
6. Turn on **Virtual Peripherals**, and then select **OK**.
7. In the **Available paired stations** field, select **Virtual Peripherals**.
8. You're prompted to either open a new shift or perform non-drawer operations. You can now open a new shift.
9. On the main screen, select **Current transaction**.
10. Select **Gift cards**.
11. Select **Ext Issue gift card**.
12. Enter a number that starts with **9**, and then provide an amount.
13. After items are added to the cart, you can pay by using cash or a card.

When you use the test connector to demonstrate support for external gift cards, you should use card number **61234** to make payments. You won't be prompted for a personal identification number (PIN). The test connector should **never** be used in production.

## External gift cards for the call center and storefront

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is new in version 10.0.9. To use it, you must set the **Enable advanced external gift card** option to **Yes** on the **Omni-channel payments** tab of the **Commerce shared parameters** page. Support for gift cards in the out-of-box storefront will be added in a future release. You should also set the **Use omni-channel payments** option to **Yes**.

![Enable advanced external gift card option](media/Configure-external-gift.png)

### Tokenization

The out-of-box implementation and Payments software development kit (SDK) support for external gift cards in the call center and storefront requires tokenization. External gift cards that are issued and managed through the back office don't include the full gift card number in the user interface (UI), and the full gift card number isn't written to the database.

External gift card numbers are always masked wherever they are saved for later reference (for example, on an order line). When external gift cards are processed, tokens are used to refer to the actual gift card number.

### Purchases and refunds

When an external gift card is used for a purchase, the tender line for the gift card is saved as a prepayment. Therefore, the funds for the purchase are captured when the order is created.

External gift cards aren't eligible for refunds. In part, this limitation is in place to prevent a refund from being given for a gift card that the user has discarded. If an unprocessed order includes an external gift card as payment, and the customer wants to cancel the order, a new gift card or some other form of credit must be issued to the customer.

Gift cards lines that are issued as part of an order can be canceled before fulfillment.

### Issuing gift cards through fulfillment

Physical gift cards and virtual gift cards have distinct fulfillment methods.

Physical gift cards are gift cards that are mapped to a mode of delivery of the **Shipping** type. They must be issued directly through the gift card provider as part of order processing. The gift card number must then be mapped to the order line as part of the pick list registration process. Next, the masked gift card number is saved back to the order line. The gift card that is issued is then activated as part of order invoicing.

Virtual gift cards are issued as part of order invoicing. When a gift card line is marked as **Packed**, it becomes eligible to be issued. Virtual gift cards are issued as part of invoicing. When invoicing occurs, the gift card number is obtained from the provider through the payment connector. The number for the activated gift card is then sent to the gift card recipient via email. When invoicing occurs, the masked gift card number is then saved back to the order line.

### Using modes of delivery for gift card products in the call center and e-commerce

In the call center and storefront channels, unlike in POS, a dedication operation isn't used to issue gift cards. Instead, gift cards are issued by adding a line item to a transaction. Specifically, gift card products for e-commerce and the call center can be either mapped to product variants or modeled as standard products.

If product variants are used, the person who creates the gift card order is prompted to select the variant. The relevant mode of delivery will then be available for that product variant.

Modes of delivery must support the type of gift card. For example, a gift card product variant of the **Physical** style must be mapped to a mode of delivery that is related to shipping. A gift card product variant of the **Email** style must be mapped to an electronic mode of delivery. The electronic mode of delivery is defined on the **Customer orders** tab of the **Commerce parameters** page.

## Setup for the call center and storefront

### Payment services setup

In the back office, on the **Payment services** page, configure the payment services account for the call center. Each payment connector requires different setup steps. The payment service that the call center uses is marked as **Default**.

#### Adyen external gift card setup

For an example that shows how to set up payment services, see the [documentation for the Adyen payment connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/retail/dev-itpro/adyen-connector?tabs=8-1-3).

For the call center and storefront, the Adyen connector supports the following gift cards.

| Brand   | Gift card type   | Supported | Activation       |
|---------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| SVS     | Physical         | Yes       | Manually         |
| SVS     | Email            | Yes       | Programmatically |
| Givex   | Physical         | Yes       | Manually         |

> [!NOTE]
> In the out-of-box Adyen connector, gift cards are configured by default. To specify the gift card provider in the merchant properties of the payment connector, follow the instructions in the previously mentioned documentation.

#### Test connector external gift card setup

To set up external gift cards for the test connector, on the **Payment services** page, select **Dyn Online**, and then, in the **Supported Tender Types** field, add **;GiftCard** after **Debit**. Then select **Credit card types**, and assign a payment journal to the gift card payment method.
