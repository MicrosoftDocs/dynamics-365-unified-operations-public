# Support for external gift cards

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up external gift cards in Retail Modern point of sale (MPOS), the call center, and the storefront.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce supports both *internal* and *external* gift cards. Internal gift cards are managed entirely in Dynamics 365 Commerce, whereas external gift cards are administered by a third party. If a retailer's operations are run entirely in Microsoft Dynamics, internal gift cards are sometimes the best solution. For complex enterprises that span multiple countries or regions, and multiple point of sale (POS) systems, it's often best to use a third party to manage gift card balances and enable gift cards to be used across those systems.

Like support for other card payment types, support for external gift cards must be built into the payment connector that is used. The out-of-box payment connector for Adyen supports external gift cards through SVS and Givex in POS, the call center, and the e-commerce storefront.

## External gift card setup

> [!NOTE]
> Some setup steps assume that demo data is used. The steps might vary, depending on the dataset that is used. The test connector is for sandbox purposes only. The test connector is not supported for use in UAT or production environments. 

### Card types

1. Search for **Card Types**. 
2. Select **New**, add the following values, and then select **Save**.

    | Field name     | Value                  |
    |----------------|------------------------|
    | Card ID        | **EXTGC**              |
    | Card type name | **External Gift Card** |
    | Card types     | **Gift card**          |
    | Card issuer    | Enter any description. |

### Card numbers

1. On the **Card types** page, select the newly created gift card, and then select **Card numbers**.
2. Specify the range of card numbers that should be used for external gift cards, and then select **Save**.

In the following example, if the first four digits of a card number are **6036**, the card will be mapped to the gift card that you set up in the "Card types" section of this topic.

| Field name         | Value |
|--------------------|-------|
| Card number from   | 6000  |
| Card number to     | 6999  |
| Digits to identify | 4     |

### Payment methods

1. Search for **Payment methods** to open the **Payment methods** page.
2. Select **New**, and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Payment method** field, enter **12**.
    2. In the **Payment method name** field, enter **External Gift Card**.
    3. In the **Default function** field, select **Card**.

6. Select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also use the **New** button to create multiple payment connectors. In this way, you can take advantage of the support for multiple connectors that has been added to the solution.

2. In the navigation bar on the left side of the page, search for **F2S1M**, and select the filtered option.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Designer** to download the button designer application.
4. When the grid designer appears, right-click on an empty (gray) area, and then select **New button**.

    ![New button.](./media/07.png)

5. Right-click the new button, and then select **Button properties**.
6. Set the **Action**, **Payment type**, and **Text on button** properties according to the following matrix.

    | Action            | Payment type       | Text on button        |
    |-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
    | Issue gift card   | External Gift Card | Ext Issue gift card   |
    | Add to gift card  | External Gift Card | Ext Add to gift card  |
    | Gift card balance | External Gift Card | Ext Gift card balance |
    | Pay gift card     | External Gift Card | Ext Pay gift card     |

10. Select **Gift cards**.
11. Select **Ext Issue gift card**.
12. Enter a number that starts with **9**, and then provide an amount.
13. After items are added to the cart, you can pay by using cash or a card.

When you use the test connector to demonstrate support for external gift cards, you should use card number **61234** to make payments. You won't be prompted for a personal identification number (PIN). The test connector should **never** be used in production.

## External gift cards for the call center and storefront

> [!NOTE]
> External gift card support for call center and storefront is enabled in the **Feature management** workspace. Enable **Omni-channel payments**, then enable **Enable advanced external gift card**. For additional steps required to set up external gift cards in the storefront, please visit the docs article dedicated to  [E-commerce digital gift cards](../digital-gift-cards.md). 
> 
#### Adyen external gift card setup

For an example that shows how to set up payment services, see the [documentation for the Adyen payment connector](adyen-connector.md?tabs=8-1-3).

For the call center and storefront, the Adyen connector supports the following gift cards.

| Brand   | Gift card type   | Supported | Activation       |
|---------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| SVS     | Physical         | Yes       | Manually         | 
| SVS     | Email            | Yes       | Programmatically |
| Givex   | Physical         | Yes       | Manually         |

> [!NOTE]
>  Only gift cards of type "Email" can be issued in an online order at this time. 
>  In the out-of-box Adyen connector, gift cards are not configured by default. To specify the gift card provider in the merchant properties of the payment connector, follow the instructions in the [documentation for the Adyen payment connector](adyen-connector.md?tabs=8-1-3).


### Tokenization

The out-of-box implementation and Payments software development kit (SDK) support for external gift cards in the call center and storefront requires tokenization. When external gift cards are processed, tokens are used to refer to the actual gift card number. This is important for 3rd party implementations because without tokens, external gift card processing may not function correctly. For example, if a gift card payment is captured when it's added to an order, but an issue occurs during order creation, the gift card payment will be reversed using references (tokens) to the transaction itself, not using the actual gift card number. 

### Purchases and refunds

When an external gift card is used for a purchase, the tender line for the gift card is saved as a prepayment. Therefore, the funds for the purchase are captured when the order is created.

External gift cards aren't eligible for refunds. In part, this limitation is in place to prevent a refund from being given for a gift card that the user has discarded. If an unprocessed order includes an external gift card as payment, and the customer wants to cancel the order, a new gift card or some other form of credit must be issued to the customer.

Gift cards lines that are issued as part of an order can be canceled before fulfillment.

### Issuing gift cards through fulfillment

Physical gift cards and virtual gift cards have distinct fulfillment methods.

Physical gift cards are gift cards that are mapped to a mode of delivery of the **Shipping** type. They must be issued directly through the gift card provider as part of order processing. The gift card number must then be mapped to the order line as part of the pick list registration process. Next, the masked gift card number is saved back to the order line. The gift card that is issued is then activated as part of order invoicing.

Virtual gift cards are issued as part of order invoicing. When a gift card line is marked as **Packed**, it becomes eligible to be issued. Virtual gift cards are issued as part of invoicing. When invoicing occurs, the gift card number is obtained from the provider through the payment connector. The number for the activated gift card is then sent to the gift card recipient via email. When invoicing occurs, the masked gift card number is then saved back to the order line.

### Using modes of delivery for gift card products in the call center and e-commerce

In the call center and storefront channels, unlike in POS, a dedication operation isn't used to issue gift cards. Instead, gift cards are issued by adding a line item to a transaction. Specifically, gift card products for e-commerce and the call center can be either mapped to product variants or modeled as standard products.

If product variants are used, the person who creates the gift card order is prompted to select the variant. The relevant mode of delivery will then be available for that product variant.

Modes of delivery must support the type of gift card. For example, a gift card product variant of the **Physical** style must be mapped to a mode of delivery that is related to shipping. A gift card product variant of the **Email** style must be mapped to an electronic mode of delivery. The electronic mode of delivery is defined on the **Customer orders** tab of the **Commerce parameters** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Only virtual gift cards are currently supported in e-commerce. For more details about setting up virtual gift cards in e-commerce, see [E-commerce digital gift cards](../digital-gift-cards.md).
