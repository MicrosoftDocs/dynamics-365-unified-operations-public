### High-level architecture
The following illustration shows a high-level overview of the N-1 setup.

![Phased Rollout (N-1) architecture](media/CDX/N-1/Overview.jpg)

## Verify that the N-1 license key is turned on
Before you start to configure and install the N-1 components, make sure that the corresponding license key is turned on. This license key is automatically turned on during an upgrade from AX 2012 R3 to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. However, because the steps that follow require this key, you should verify that it's turned on before you continue.

1. Sign in to Commerce Headquarters, and go to **System administration \> Setup \> License configuration**.
2. On the **Configuration keys** tab, expand the **Commerce** key, expand the **Commerce scheduler** key, and verify that the check box for the **Retail Data Commerce Exchange backward compatibility** key is selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the key isn't turned on, contact Microsoft Support for help turning it on.

## Set up Azure AD accounts
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To help maintain a high level of security across the company, we strongly recommend that you create a new client ID and secret for this installation. This step requires a new Web App.

1. Generate an Azure Web App to create a client ID and secret for Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX. For instructions, see the "Create an Azure Active Directory application" section in [Create an Azure Active Directory Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal).
2. After you've finished creating the client ID and secret, the client ID must be accepted in Commerce. Go to **System administration \> Setup \> Azure Active Directory applications**. Enter the client ID in the **Client Id** column, enter descriptive text in the **Name** column, and enter **RetailServiceAccount** in the **User ID** column.

## Install N-1 components
Before you run the Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX installers, make sure that the following requirements are met:

- The installer requires that the Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.1 be installed on the system.
- The installers install the Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX applications only on the following operating systems. Before you install any component, you must update the operating system with all service packs and updates that are available for it.

    - Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate edition (both x86 and x64 architectures). Home edition and embedded edition aren't supported.
    - Windows 8.1 Update 1 Pro or Enterprise edition (both x86 and x64 architectures). Standard edition isn't supported.
    - Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise edition (both x86 and x64 architectures). Home edition isn't supported.
    - Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 or Microsoft Windows Server 2016.

### Async Server Connector Service
The installer validates that all prerequisites are met. These prerequisites include SQL prerequisites, such as a local installation of SQL Server, or the alternative prerequisites, such as SQL Command Line Utilities and other required SQL connectivity installations.

To meet prerequisites, the SQL Server that is connected to must have Full-text search and, at a minimum, support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. For Microsoft SQL Server 2012, Service Pack 3 must be installed, at a minimum. For Microsoft SQL Server 2014, Service Pack 2 must be installed.

If a system restart is required, the installer shows this requirement. Although the restart is recommended, the installer can continue without it.

When you're ready, follow these steps to download and install the component.

1. Sign in to Headquarters, and go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler \> Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX**.
2. Select the connector that you created earlier.
3. On the Action Pane, on the **Download** tab, select **Async Server Connector service** to download the installer file, and then select **Configuration file** below **Async Server Connector service** to download the corresponding configuration file. Make sure that the configuration file is saved next to the installer file.
4. After the installer and configuration files are downloaded, double-click the installer file, and follow these steps:

    1. Verify the Application Object Server (AOS) URL (the URL that is used to access Headquarters), and then select **Next**.
    2. If a specific user is required, enter the user name and password that the service should run as. By default, the installer automatically generates a service account to use. This approach is more secure and is recommended, but it can't be used when the database is located on a separate computer. Select **Next** to continue.
    3. Enter the application ID (client ID) and secret that are associated with this Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX installation.
    4. Select **Install**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - For information about how to correctly generate an Azure Web App to create a client ID and secret, see the "Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD" section in [Create an Azure Active Directory Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal).
    > - When you create the Web App, the initial URI and URL don't have to be any specific value. Only the application ID (client ID) and secret that are created are important.

5. After an application ID (client ID) and secret are created, the application ID must be accepted in Commerce. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Azure Active Directory applications**. Enter the application ID in the **Client Id** column, enter descriptive text in the **Name** column, and enter **RetailServiceAccount** in the **User ID** column.
6. Sign in to Headquarters, and go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Parameters \> Commerce shared parameters**.
7. On the **Identity Providers** tab, select the provider that has an **Issuer** value that begins with `HTTPS://sts.windows.net/`. The values on the **Relying parties** FastTab are automatically set, based on your selection.
8. On the **Relying parties** FastTab, select **Add**. Enter the application ID (client ID) that was created for this installation. Set the **Type** field to **Public** and the **UserType** field to **Worker**. Then, on the Action Pane, select **Save**.
9. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

### N-1 Real-time service
1. Sign in to Headquarters, and go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler \> Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX**.
2. Select the connector that you created earlier.
3. On the Action Pane, on the **Download** tab, select **Real-time service for Dynamics AX 2012 R3** to download the installer file, and then select **Configuration file** below **Real-time service for Dynamics AX 2012 R3** to download the corresponding configuration file. Make sure that the configuration file is saved next to the setup file.
3. After the installer and configuration files are downloaded, double-click the installer file, and follow these steps:

    1. Verify the AOS URL (the URL that is used to access Headquarters), and then select **Next**.
    2. Select a valid SSL certificate to use for HTTPS communication, and then select **Next**.

        The certificate must use private key storage, and server authentication must be listed in the enhanced key usage property. Additionally, the certificate must be trusted locally, and it can't be expired. It must be stored in the personal certificate store location on the local computer.

    3. If a specific user is required, enter the user name and password that the application pool should run as. By default, the installer automatically generates a service account to use. This approach is more secure and is recommended, but it can't be used when the database is located on a separate computer. Select **Next** to continue.
    4. Verify the HTTPS port that should be used, and verify that the host name of the computer is correct. Select **Next** to continue.

        The HTTPS port is listed in the Store system profile. To access the Store system profile, on the **Store details** page, on the **Store systems** FastTab, select the profile ID of the selected Store system. The installer automatically enters the host name. If, for any reason, the host name must be changed for the installation, change it here. The host name must be the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the system, and it must match the value that you entered on the **Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX** page earlier in this topic.

    5. Enter the application ID (client ID) and secret that are associated with this Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX installation. Then select **Install**.

        This application ID and secret can be the same application ID and secret that you used in the Async Server Connector service installation. For information about how to correctly generate an Azure Web App to create a client ID and secret, see the "Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD" section in [Create an Azure Active Directory Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal). When you create the Web App, the initial URI and URL don't have to be any specific value. Only the application ID (client ID) and secret that are created are important.

## Cutover steps to switch to N-1
This section gives the recommended step-by-step instructions to switch an existing AX 2012 R3 channel environment from the AX 2012 R3 headquarters to the Commerce Headquarters. Note that these instructions are generic. Different implementations will likely have to deviate from these steps to accommodate specific business or technical requirements.

### Prerequisites
Follow these steps to prepare your environment for the cutover.

| Step | Details | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Deploy Headquarters. | Headquarters is up and running. Cloud POS (CPOS) can be used to validate functionality in the environment. | Weeks or months before the cutover |
| 2. Install the Commerce application (X++) KBs. | Install the KBs that are listed in the [Required KBs for N-1](#required-kbs-for-n-1) section to make sure all issues that are related to N-1 are addressed. | Weeks or months before the cutover |
| 3. Set up Azure AD accounts. | Follow the instructions in the [Set up Azure AD accounts](#set-up-azure-ad-accounts) section to create the accounts that are required for the N-1 components to authenticate against Headquarters. | Weeks or months before the cutover |
| 4. Configure Headquarters. | Follow the instructions in the [Configure N-1 components](#configure-n-1-components) section to configure all the settings for the N-1 components before they are installed. | Weeks or months before the cutover |
| 5. Install the N-1 components. | Follow the instructions in the [Install N-1 components](#install-n-1-components) section to install the N-1 components. Note that the N-1 Async Server Connector Service component should be installed but immediately disabled to help guarantee that AX 2012 R3 and Dynamics 365 CDX packages aren't mixed. | Weeks or months before the cutover |

### Preparation
Follow these steps to prepare a few days before the cutover is scheduled.

| Step | Details | Timeline | How to validate that this step is done |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Stop all AX 2012 R3 download jobs. | Make sure that all AX 2012 R3 download jobs are stopped in the AX 2012 R3 headquarters. | At least a couple days before the cutover | All packages in the AX 2012 R3 network share for upload jobs are processed, and no new packages appear. |
| 2. Do a full synchronization of all **AX63** CDX download jobs in Headquarters. | Run the CDX download jobs to make sure that the packages are generated and dropped in the Azure Blob storage blob, so that the N-1 Async Server Connector Service can consume them during cutover. | At least a couple days before the cutover | CDX download jobs are in the **Available** state on the **Download Sessions** page in Headquarters. |

### Cutover steps
Follow these steps to do the actual cutover.

| Step | Details | Timeline | How to validate that this step is done |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Close all shifts. | Make sure that all shifts are closed. | After store closing | Manually validate with the stores that the shifts are closed. |
| 2. Clean up any suspended transactions. | Make sure that all suspended transactions are cleaned up. | After the previous step | Manually validate with the stores that the shifts are closed. |
| 3. Synchronize all transactional data. | Make sure that all transactional data is synchronized through the CDX upload jobs to the AX 2012 R3 headquarters. | After the previous step | All packages in the AX 2012 R3 network share for upload jobs are processed, and no new packages appear. |
| 4. Disable AX 2012 R3 CDX upload jobs. | Make sure that all AX 2012 R3 upload jobs are disabled, so that packages are no longer being picked up. | After the previous step | Manually validate through the AX 2012 R3 headquarters UI that the CDX upload jobs are disabled. |
| 5. Shut down the AX 2012 R3 Real-time Service. | Connect to the server that hosts the AX 2012 R3 Real-time Service, start IIS, right-click the AX 2012 R3 Real-time Service, and stop the service. | After the previous step | Manually validate in IIS that the service is stopped. |
| 6. Run the **Reset metadata synchronization** command in Headquarters. | In Microsoft Dynamics AX, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler \> Connector for Microsoft Dynamics AX**, and select **Reset metadata synchronization** to reset the **HQMessageDB** database in the AX 2012 R3 environment for N-1 cutover. | After the previous step | Not applicable |
| 7. Turn on the N-1 Async Server Connector Service. | Connect to the server that hosts the N-1 Async Server Connector Service, and enable the Microsoft Windows service. | After the previous step | The status of download jobs on the **Download Sessions** page in Headquarters changes from **Available** to **Applied**. |

The following illustration is a visual representation of these steps.

## Troubleshooting steps
This section describes some typical issues that you might encounter, and the steps that you can follow to investigate or recover from them.

### Runtime
This section describes troubleshooting steps for errors that you might encounter during the runtime of the application.

#### Metadata synchronization fails
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Event Log | Microsoft-Dynamics-Commerce-AsyncServerConnectorService/Operational |
| Sample Event Log Error Message | Async server connector service encounters error in download timer tick. CorrelationId {4c9cd9a0-d4e3-43e5-80da-59ea2eb01acf}; Error details: Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.AsyncServerConnector.Service.Exceptions.SyncMetadataException: Failed synchronizing metadata. ---\> Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.AsyncServerConnector.Service.Exceptions.MessageDBOperationException: Failed updating metadata in HQ message DB. ---\> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.) ---\> System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted |
| Troubleshooting Steps | This could have happened because the Synch service web.config connection string has the TrustServerCertificate set to false. To fix the issue browse the Sync service website and open the web.config. Find the connectionStrings section, update the TrustServerCertificate to True if it is false. |

#### Metadata synchronization fails
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Event Log | Microsoft-Dynamics-Commerce-AsyncServerConnectorService/Operational |
| Sample Event Log Error Message | Async server connector service encounters error in download timer tick. CorrelationId {73d9d0d3-4d12-42ca-ac65-3f1f947c7840}; Error details: Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.AsyncServerConnector.Service.Exceptions.SyncMetadataException: Failed synchronizing metadata. ---\> Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.AsyncServerConnector.Service.Exceptions.MessageDBOperationException: Failed updating metadata in HQ message DB. ---\> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Cannot open database "HQMessageDB" requested by the login. The login failed. Login failed for user 'localhost\\RetailAsUser'. |
| Troubleshooting Steps | This could have happened because the user who runs the Async server connector service does not have access to the HQ message database. To fix the issue run services.msc, check the user who runs the Async server connector service. Provide this user access to HQ message database in SQL. |

#### Metadata synchronization fails, or CDX jobs are successfully downloaded but aren't applied

| Event Log | Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail : Async Client SynchClientService |
| Sample Event Log Error Message | Unable to communicate with server for download. Please check username/password, server and database connections. Error Details: System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException: An error occurred while making the HTTP request to `https://localhost:44300/SynchService/DownloadService.svc`. This could be due to the fact that the server certificate is not configured properly with HTTP.SYS in the HTTPS case. This could also be caused by a mismatch of the security binding between the client and the server. ---\> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send. ---\> System.IO.IOException: Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream. |
| Troubleshooting Steps | This could have happened because of the following reasons.<br>1) The user ID and password that we provide in async client does not match with the channel database User ID and password that we provide in AX.<br>2) The async service end point is not reachable. `https://localhost:44300/SynchService/DownloadService.svc`. To fix this issue, 1) Launch the Async client configuration utility (AsyncClientConfigurationUtility.exe) from the async client install location. Under the `Async Server connection tab -> Authentication information (case sensitive)` -> Update the Channel database ID, User name and Password fields as per the values provided under N-1 channel database (`Retail and Commerce -> Headquarters setup -> Channel database`) in AX. 2) Now click on `Test connection` in the utility. If the connection is successful, restart the Async client service. If the connection fails, go to N-1 channel database (`Retail and Commerce -> Headquarters setup -> Channel database`) in AX, update the Username and password, save. Go to `Retail scheduler parameters` in AX and click `Reset metadata synchronization`. This will populate the HQ message database with the new values. Repeat step 1 again. 3) If the async server end point (`https://localhost:44300/SynchService/DownloadService.svc`) is not reachable, check the bindings of the service and make sure there is a certificate associated. If the issue still exists, check that the `Working folders` were specified for all the Channel database group’s that were linked to `AX2012R3` retail channel schema. |
