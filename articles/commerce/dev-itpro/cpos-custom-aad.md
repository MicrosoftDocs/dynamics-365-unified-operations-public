# Configure Store Commerce for web to use a custom Microsoft Entra app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Store Commerce for web to use a custom Microsoft Entra app.

By default, Store Commerce for web points to a registered first-party Microsoft app in Microsoft Entra ID. Therefore, you can use Store Commerce for web without having to make any changes in Microsoft Entra ID. However, you might want to point your instance of Store Commerce for web to a custom Microsoft Entra app that you control. This article explains how to configure Store Commerce for web to use a custom Microsoft Entra app. 

> [!NOTE] 
> This article only applies to self-hosted Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) installations or development using a self-hosted CSU.

## Update the Store Commerce for web configuration file

The following steps only apply to a CSU (self-hosted) that uses the Retail SDK. If you are using a sealed CSU installer, this process is completed automatically during the installation process. Open the Store Commerce for web config.json file, and make the following changes.

1. Replace the **Microsoft Entra IDClientId** key value with the **Application (client) ID** value of the custom Store Commerce for web app that you created in the [Set up a custom Store Commerce for web app in Microsoft Entra ID](#set-up-a-custom-app-for-store-commerce-for-web-in-microsoft-entra-id) section.
1. Replace the **Microsoft Entra IDRetailServerResourceId** key value with the **Application ID URI** value of the custom Retail Server app that you created in the [Set up a custom Retail Server app in Microsoft Entra ID](#set-up-a-custom-retail-server-app-in-microsoft-entra-id) section.

Store Commerce for web will use both parameters when it sends requests to Microsoft Entra ID to acquire a security token.

## Update identity providers settings in Commerce headquarters

Next, you must update identity providers settings in Commerce headquarters.

1. In Commerce headquarters, open the **Commerce shared parameters** page.
1. On the **Identity Providers** tab, in the **Identity providers** section, select the row where the **Type** field is set to **Microsoft Entra** and the **Issuer** field points to your Microsoft Entra tenant. This setting declares that you'll work with child grids that contain the data that's related to the identity provider that corresponds to your Microsoft Entra tenant.
1. In the **Relying parties** section, select **Add** to add a row.
1. Set the following fields:

    - **ClientId** – Enter the **Application (client) ID** value of the custom Store Commerce for web app that you created in the [Set up a custom Store Commerce for web app in Microsoft Entra ID](#set-up-a-custom-app-for-store-commerce-for-web-in-microsoft-entra-id) section.
    - **Type** – Select **Public**.
    - **UserType** – Select **Worker**.

1. Select the row that you added. The **Server Resource IDs** section below the **Relying Parties** section shows the Retail Server app IDs that can be accessed by the app that you selected in the **Relying Parties** grid.
1. In the **Server Resource IDs** section, select **Add** to add a row.
1. In the **Server Resource Id** field, enter the **Application ID URI** value of the custom Retail Server app that you created in the [Set up a custom Retail Server app in Microsoft Entra ID](#set-up-a-custom-retail-server-app-in-microsoft-entra-id) section.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > All the fields that are mentioned in the preceding steps are case-sensitive. The values that you enter must exactly match the values that are configured in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce IT \> Distribution schedule**, and run the **1110** (**Global configuration**) job.
