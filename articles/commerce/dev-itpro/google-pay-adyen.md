# Configure Google Pay with Adyen

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!WARNING]
> The Dynamics 365 Commerce team is investigating an issue with Google Pay in Google Chrome browsers when in production. Currently, the Google Pay functionality fails to render in Chrome. Commerce is working with Google to identify a fix for this issue to support Google Pay via Adyen in the Commerce solution.

This article describes how to configure Google Pay with Adyen in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

Dynamics 365 Commerce offers an out-of-box integration for Google Pay when the Adyen payment gateway service is used. Google Pay is a digital wallet payment method that uses a Google Pay Merchant account in coordination with the Adyen payment service. When it's configured, the Google Pay button is available as a selectable payment method during online order checkout. When users select **Google Pay** in a supported browser or device, they're directed to complete their payment directly with the Google Pay service. They're then returned to the online storefront to complete the order.

When Google Pay is used with the express checkout module in Commerce, the user's payment account information is automatically prepopulated in the checkout form to help shoppers get through the checkout process faster. Commerce includes a *payment express* module that enables express checkout behavior. Payment express modules can be used on the checkout or cart pages. Google Pay can also be configured with Adyen payment terminals and the Commerce point of sale (POS) for in-store use.

## Key terms

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| Google Pay | Also known as the Google Pay "button," Google Pay is a wallet payment offering that is supported via the Adyen connector. It enables the customer experience and integration that are supported by the Dynamics Google Pay Connector. |
| Wallet | A payment type that doesn't include traditional payment characteristics, such as the bank identification number (BIN) range and expiration date that are used to differentiate credit and debit card types. |
| Payment express module | A Dynamics 365 Commerce module that supports faster checkout behavior with supported payment methods. |

## Prerequisites

- Using Google Pay with Adyen in Commerce requires a Google Merchant account. For information about how to set up your Google Merchant account, see the [Adyen documentation on Google Pay](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/google-pay/).
- Follow steps 2 and 3 of [Adyen Google Pay Drop-in integration - Before you begin](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/google-pay/web-drop-in#before-you-begin).
- Review steps 1 and 2 of [Adyen Google Pay Drop-in integration - Before you go live](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/google-pay/web-drop-in#before-you-go-live).
- The Google Pay payment method must be integrated with your Adyen account. For instructions, see [Adyen Google Pay](https://www.adyen.com/payment-methods/google-pay).
- You must enable the enhanced wallet feature in Dynamics 365 Commerce headquarters. Go to **Workspaces \> Feature management**, search for the **Enhanced wallet support and payment improvements** feature, select the feature, and then select **Enable**. After the feature has been enabled, run the **1110** distribution schedule to make the change available in all channels.

## Map the Google Pay payment method

Google Pay is a digital wallet payment method. For information about how to set up payment mapping for Google Pay, see [Wallet payment support](../wallets.md).

To map the Google Pay payment method to card tender types for both POS and online channels, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Payment methods \> Card types**.
1. Select **New** to add a line for Google Pay.
1. In the **ID** field, enter **GooglePay**.

### Use the payment express module with Google Pay

The Commerce payment express module works with supporting payment methods to give site customers the option to check out faster by using their payment service account information during the checkout process. The payment express module references the configured connector button and returns the user-selected order details (address, contact information, and payment method) to prefill the checkout form.

When the payment express module is used with Google Pay, if customers select the Google Pay button in the **Payment Express** section, the Google Pay payment window is opened. Users can then sign in to their Google account to use their account shipping address, billing address, email address, and Google Pay payment method of choice to pay for the transaction.

When users complete the action in the Google Pay window, they're directed to the Commerce site checkout page, where the checkout form is prefilled with their Google Pay account details. After users return to the checkout page from the Google Pay window, they'll see the following details:

- In the payment express flow, the first delivery option that is available for the shipping address that was returned will be preselected for the customer.
- The shipping address and contact information, such as the customer's email address, are populated in the checkout form. If they're using express checkout, the email address from the express account is used.
- The payment method is selected from the customer's digital Google Pay wallet.

Customers can review orders and change checkout order details before they select **Place order** to finalize the order.

### Configure Google Pay in site builder 

Before you configure your fragments or pages with Google Pay, you must ensure that your content security policies for your site are set in Commerce site builder.

To ensure that your content security policies are set in site builder, follow these steps.

    1. Set the **Supported tender types** value to **GooglePay**. This value must match the **Supported Tender Types** string in the connector that's set up for the channel. For more information, see the [Configure a Commerce online store for Google Pay](#configure-a-commerce-online-store-for-google-pay) section earlier in this article.
    1. For the **Height of the iFrame** property, set a height in pixels that meets your page design needs (for example, enter **50** to set a height of 50 pixels).

1. Select **Save** to save your changes, and then select **Finish editing**.
1. Select **Publish** to publish the page.

Users can include up to three supported **Payment Express** modules (in other words, three available supported payment options) in the cart **Payment Express** slot.

### Set up Google Pay as an option in the checkout payment section

You can set up Google Pay as an option in the checkout payment section for payment-only, non-express functionality. The checkout form is filled in by the user, and the Google Pay payment page only readies the checkout for payment by Google Pay. No Google account information is used to overwrite the filled-in checkout details.

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure assumes that your site uses a checkout fragment that is configured with pickup information, a shipping address, delivery options, contact information, optional terms and conditions, and a section for checkout elements. The default module library checkout module is released with a checkout section container that has text block, loyalty points, gift card, and payment modules. For more information, see [Payment module](../payment-module.md).

To set up Google Pay as a regular payment option in the **Payment Method** section of the checkout page, follow these steps.

1. In site builder, go to **Fragments**, and then select your site's checkout fragment.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. In the **Checkout information** slot, select the ellipsis (**...**), and then select **Add module**.
1. In the **Select modules** dialog box, select the **Payment** module, and then select **OK**.
1. In the **Payment** module's properties pane on the right, set the properties for the container module:

    - **Heading** – Enter a heading to display for the express checkout section of your site (for example, **Google Pay**).
    - **Height of the iFrame** – Change the value to your preferred design height in pixels (for example, **75**). 
    - **Supported tender types** – Enter **GooglePay** to match the configuration for the Google Pay connector in Commerce headquarters.
    - **Is primary payment** – Leave the checkbox cleared. (This property is typically enabled for the Adyen checkout module.)
    - **Payment style override** – This property isn't supported for the Google Pay configuration.
    - **Use connector id** – This property must be selected if multiple payment connectors are used on the page.

1. Position the module above or below other payment modules by selecting the ellipsis (**...**) in the **Payment** slot, and then selecting **Move up** or **Move down**.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes, and then select **Finish editing**.
1. Select **Publish**.

### Modes of delivery

With the payment express module that uses Google Pay, the first delivery option that is returned against the selected shipping address from the Google Pay account will be preselected. Users have an opportunity to adjust the shipping address to a different option if they want.

The order in which the delivery methods are displayed in the payment express module is configured on the channel's **Modes of delivery** page in Commerce headquarters. In Commerce headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channels \> Online stores**, and select the **Retail channel ID** value for your store. On the Action Pane, on the **Setup** tab,  select **Modes of delivery**. The modes of delivery that are listed will be displayed in the same order in the payment express module. Select **Manage modes of delivery** on the Action Pane to add or remove modes of delivery for a retail channel or product. For more information about how to set up modes of delivery, see [Set up modes of delivery](/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-up-modes-of-delivery).

The checkout module also uses the delivery options module when modes of delivery are rendered during checkout. For more information, see [Delivery options module](../delivery-options-module.md).

Modes of delivery are displayed as they're added to the **Modes of delivery** list in the online store.

## Configure Commerce POS for Google Pay

The POS configuration uses the setting of the hardware profile's **EFT service** field for the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen. For information about how to configure the electronic funds transfer (EFT) service for the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen in Commerce headquarters, see [Set up a Dynamics 365 POS hardware profile](adyen-connector-setup.md#set-up-a-dynamics-365-pos-hardware-profile).

The processor mapping for the Adyen connector captures the wallet card types that Google Pay uses at the POS terminal. Map for the desired card type against the **Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen** and **Processor payment** options. The mapping steps resemble the steps in the [Map the Google Payment method](#map-the-google-pay-payment-method) section. Because POS supports only a single connector as configured for the store, the payment connector will map against the **Processor payment** value that's returned by Adyen.
