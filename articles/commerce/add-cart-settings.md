# Apply add product to cart settings

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article covers **Add product to cart** settings and describes how to apply them in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

Different workflows are supported when a product is added to the cart on a Dynamics 365 Commerce e-commerce site. For example, the site user might be taken to the cart page. Alternatively, the user might remain on the current page but receive a notification that confirms that the product was added to the cart.

To support the different workflows, an **Add product to cart** field is available at **Settings \> Extensions** in Commerce site builder. Select one of the following setting options to implement the corresponding workflow:

- **Navigate to cart page** – When users add an item to the cart, they are taken to the cart page.
- **Show notification** – When users add an item to the cart, they receive a confirmation notification and can continue to browse on the product details page (PDP).
- **Show mini cart** – When users add an item to the cart, the mini cart contents are shown. Users can review all the items in the cart, and they can proceed to checkout if they are ready.
- **Show notification using Notifications module** – When users add an item to the cart, the notifications module is used to show a confirmation notification. For this setting option to work, the notifications module must be added to the page header.
- **Do not navigate to cart page** – When users add an item to the cart, they remain on the current page.

The following illustration shows an example of the **Add product to cart** setting options in site builder.
