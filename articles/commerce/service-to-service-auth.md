# Configure Service-to-Service authentication

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to configure Service-to-Service (S2S) authentication in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce to securely call service application programming interfaces (APIs) for ratings and reviews.

Dynamics 365 Commerce offers [ratings and reviews](ratings-reviews-overview.md) as an omni-channel solution. This solution enables access to service APIs from outside Commerce, so that various tasks can be performed. These tasks include importing ratings and reviews from your external system into Commerce, and exporting ratings and reviews from Commerce. To enable Commerce to securely call ratings and reviews service APIs, you must first configure S2S authentication by completing the procedures in this article.

## Add a new app registration

Before you add a new app registration, you must create an application by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). To register an app in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and enable authentication, follow the steps in [Use Azure Active Directory with a custom connector in Power Automate](/connectors/custom-connectors/azure-active-directory-authentication).

Collect the following IDs from the Azure portal. You will need these IDs in the steps that follow.

- Client application ID
- Client directory (tenant) ID

To add a new app registration in Commerce site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Home \> Reviews \> Settings**.
1. Under **Service-to-Service (S2S) Authentication**, select **Manage**.
