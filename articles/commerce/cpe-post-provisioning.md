[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to configure a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce evaluation environment after it's provisioned.

## Overview

Complete the procedures in this topic only after your Commerce evaluation environment has been provisioned. For information about how to provision your Commerce evaluation environment, see [Provision a Commerce evaluation environment](provisioning-guide.md).

After your Commerce evaluation environment has been provisioned end to end, additional post-provisioning configuration steps must be completed before you can start to evaluate the environment. To complete these steps, you must use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) and Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Before you start

1. Sign in to the [LCS portal](https://lcs.dynamics.com).
1. Go to your project.
1. On the top menu, select **Cloud-hosted environments**.
1. Select your environment in the list.
1. In the environment information on the right, select **Log on to environment**. You will be sent to Commerce headquarters.
1. Make sure that the **USRT** legal entity is selected in the upper-right corner.

During post-provisioning activities in Commerce headquarters, make sure that the **USRT** legal entity is always selected.

## Configure the point of sale
