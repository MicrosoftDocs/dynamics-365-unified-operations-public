# Configure a Dynamics 365 Commerce evaluation environment

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce evaluation environment after it's provisioned.

Complete the procedures in this article only after your Commerce evaluation environment has been provisioned. For information about how to provision your Commerce evaluation environment, see [Provision a Commerce evaluation environment](provisioning-guide.md).

After your Commerce evaluation environment has been provisioned end to end, additional post-provisioning configuration steps must be completed before you can start to evaluate the environment. To complete these steps, you must use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) and Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Before you start

1. Sign in to the [LCS portal](https://lcs.dynamics.com).
1. Go to your project.
1. On the top menu, select **Cloud-hosted environments**.
1. Select your environment in the list.
1. In the environment information on the right, select **Log on to environment**. You will be sent to Commerce headquarters.
1. Make sure that the **USRT** legal entity is selected in the upper-right corner.
1. Go to **Commerce parameters \> Configuration parameters** and ensure that there's an entry for **ProductSearch.UseAzureSearch** and that the value is set to **true**. If this entry is missing, you can add it, set the value to **true**, and then select **Channel Database \> Full data sync** for the Commerce Scale Unit associated with your e-commerce website.
1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler \> Initialize Commerce scheduler**. On the **Initialize commerce scheduler** flyout menu, set the **Delete existing configuration** option to **Yes**, and then select **OK**.
1. To add channels to the Commerce Scale Unit, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler \>Channel database**, and then in the left pane select the Commerce Scale Unit. On the **Retail channel** FastTab, add the **AW online store**, **AW Business online store**, and **Fabrikam extended online store** channels. Optionally, you can also add retail stores if you will be using POS (for example, **Seattle**, **San Francisco**, and **San Jose**).

During post-provisioning activities in Commerce headquarters, make sure that the **USRT** legal entity is always selected.

## Configure the point of sale

### Associate a worker with your identity

To associate a worker with your identity, follow these steps in Commerce headquarters.

1. Use the menu on the left to go to **Modules \> Retail and commerce \> Employees \> Workers**.

### Activate Cloud POS

To activate Cloud POS, follow these steps in LCS.

1. On the top menu, select **Cloud-hosted environments**.

## Set up your site in Commerce

To start to set up your evaluation site in Commerce, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to site builder by using the URL that you made a note of when you initialized e-Commerce during provisioning (see [Initialize e-Commerce](provisioning-guide.md#initialize-e-commerce)).
1. Select the **Fabrikam** site to open the site setup dialog box.
1. Select the domain that you entered when you initialized e-Commerce.
1. Select **Fabrikam extended online store** as the default channel. (Make sure that you select the **extended** online store.)
1. Select **en-us** as the default language.

1. Repeat steps 2-7 for the **AdventureWorks** site (which maps to the **AW online store** channel) and the **AdventureWorks Business** site (which maps to the **AW Business online store** channel). If the **Path** field for the Fabrikam site is empty, then you must to add paths for the two AdventureWorks sites (for example, "aw" and "awbusiness").

## Enable jobs

To enable jobs in Commerce, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the environment (HQ).

* Synchronize orders job

### Run full data synchronization

To run full data synchronization in Commerce, follow these steps in Commerce headquarters.

### Test credit card information to do test purchases

To perform test transactions on the site, you can use the following test credit card information:

- **Card number:** 4111-1111-1111-1111
- **Expiration date:** 10/30
- **Card verification value (CVV) code:** 737

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never, under any circumstances, try to use actual credit card information on the test site.

## Next steps

After the provisioning and configuration steps are completed, you can start to use your evaluation environment. Use the Commerce site builder URL to go to the authoring experience. Use the Commerce site URL to go to the retail customer site experience.

To configure optional features for your Commerce evaluation environment, see [Configure optional features for a Commerce evaluation environment](cpe-optional-features.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Commerce evaluation environments come with a preloaded Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) business-to-consumer (B2C) tenant for demonstration purposes. Configuring your own Azure AD B2C tenant is not required for evaluation environments. However, if you are configuring the evaluation environment to use your own Azure AD B2C tenant, please make sure to add ``https://login.commerce.dynamics.com/_msdyn365/authresp`` as a reply URL in the Azure AD B2C application via the Azure Portal.

## Troubleshooting

### Site builder channel list is empty when configuring site

If site builder does not show any online store channels, in headquarters ensure that the channels have been added to the Commerce Scale Unit as described in the [Before you start](#before-you-start) section above. Also, run **Initialize commerce scheduler** with the **Delete existing configuration** value set to **Yes**.  Once these are steps are completed, on the **Channel database** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler \> Channel database**), run the **9999** job on the Commerce Scale Unit.

### Color swatches are not rendering on the category page, but are rendering on the product details page (PDP) page

Follow these steps to ensure that the color and size swatches are set to be refinable.

1. In headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Channel categories and product attributes**.
1. In the left pane, select the online store channel, and then select **Set attribute metadata**.
1. Set the **Show attribute on channel** option to **Yes**, set the **Can be refined** option to **Yes**, and then select **Save**. 
1. Return to the online store channel page, and then select **Publish channel updates**.
1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Commerce scheduler \> Channel database** and run the **9999** job on the Commerce Scale Unit.

### Business features don't appear to be turned on for the AdventureWorks business site

In headquarters, ensure that the online store channel is configured with the **Customer type** set to **B2B**. If the **Customer type** is set to **B2C**, a new channel must be created since the existing channel can't be edited. 

Demo data shipped in Commerce version 10.0.26 and earlier had a bug where the **AW Business online store** channel was misconfigured. The workaround is to create a new channel with the same settings and configurations except for **Customer type**, which should be set to **B2B**.
