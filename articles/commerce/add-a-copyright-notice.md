## Prerequisites
Before you can add a copyright notice on your site, you must

To add a copyright notice to the footer for your site, follow these steps:

1. Open the Footer fragment by going to the Fragments tab and selecting Footer
2. Click Check out to make the Footer fragment writeable 
3. Expand the Footer module and sub footer Slot
4. Select Sub footer or if it does not exist, click the ellipsis menu in order to add it using "Add module"
5. Click "Add Data Source" from the properties pane, Choose "Heading"
6. Add your copyright notice in "Input text" field.

After saving the fragment your Copyright Notice is visible automatically on all pages that use the Footer.
