# SDK and module library updates

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic covers regular updates that will be released as part of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce online software development kit (SDK).

## Overview

Regular updates will be released as part of the Dynamics 365 Commerce online SDK and module library. These updates might include new features or product fixes. Product release notes will be provided for all changes.

## Dependency versions in the packages.json file

The SDK packages.json file that is included in the SDK root directory controls which versions of the SDK, module library, Fabrikam design kit, and Retail Server proxy are downloaded. The specific entries can be found in the **"dependencies"** section, as shown in the following example. Note that the version numbers might differ, depending on when the SDK was acquired.

```json
...
"dependencies": {
    "@msdyn365-commerce-modules/starter-pack": "9.25",
    "@msdyn365-commerce-modules/fabrikam-design-kit": "9.25",
    "@msdyn365-commerce/bootloader": "^1.0.0",
    "@msdyn365-commerce/retail-proxy": "9.25",
}
...
```

- **\@msdyn365-commerce-modules/starter-pack** – This entry represents the module library, which includes the set of starter modules and data actions. The preceding example is configured to pull down only the specified version.
- **\@msdyn365-commerce-modules/fabrikam-design-kit** – This entry represents the Fabrikam design kit, which includes the Fabrikam theme. The Fabrikam theme defines specific Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and module view overrides for the set of modules in the module library. The preceding example is configured to pull down only the specified version.
- **\@msdyn365-commerce/retail-proxy** – This entry represents the Retail Server proxy, which is used to access the set of APIs for the Commerce Scale Unit. The preceding example is configured to pull down only the specified version.
- **\@msdyn365-commerce/bootloader** – This entry represents the SDK. The caret (\^) symbol ensures that the **yarn** command always pulls down the latest released version.

The version numbers that are used in the preceding example are in the format *X.Y.Z*, where *X* is the major version, *Y* is the minor version, and *Z* is the patch version.

SDK dependencies are backward-compatible and can be pulled down at any time. The module library minor versions are dependent on the Commerce Scale Unit. Therefore, they can't be higher than the versions that are shown in the table that follows.

Patch versions won't change dependencies on the Commerce Scale Unit. Therefore, they can be updated at any time. The tilde (\~) symbol can be used with version numbers to ensure that any patch versions that might include software updates are always pulled down. The following example shows how the tilde is used to pull down the latest patch version.

```json
...
"dependencies": {
    "@msdyn365-commerce-modules/starter-pack": "~9.26.0",
    "@msdyn365-commerce-modules/fabrikam-design-kit": "~9.26.0",
    "@msdyn365-commerce/bootloader": "^1.0.0",
    "@msdyn365-commerce/retail-proxy": "~9.26.0",
}
...
```
The following table maps module library versions to Commerce Scale Unit versions. The same module library versions that are mapped to the Commerce Scale Unit should be used for the Retail Server proxy and Fabrikam design kit. The table lists current supported versions as of **January 25, 2021**.

| Commerce Scale Unit version | Maximum module library version |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 10.0.10 | 9.20.x |
| 10.0.11 | 9.21.x |
| 10.0.12 | 9.22.x |
| 10.0.13 | 9.23.x |
| 10.0.14 | 9.24.x |
| 10.0.15 | 9.25.x |
| 10.0.16 | 9.26.x |

## Pull updates

The SDK, module library, and other dependency updates are optional and can be pulled down to a local development environment by using the **yarn** command in the SDK source code. When this command is run, the latest dependencies are pulled down, based on the versions that are specified in the packages.json file. Before you run the **yarn** command, you should delete the yarn.lock file from the root directory. Optionally, you can also delete the /node\_modules folder to get a clean set of dependency files.

After the latest dependencies are pulled down, you can run **yarn start** to run the Node server on your development environment and test the new SDK and module library components.

When a configuration package is created by using the **yarn msdyn365 pack** command-line interface (CLI) tool, all dependencies are updated to their local versions during the packaging process. The package that is created can then be uploaded to an online site by using Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

## Determine the latest released versions of the dependency packages

To determine the latest released versions of the dependency packages, follow these feed links:

- [Module library feed](https://dev.azure.com/commerce-partner/Registry/_packaging?_a=package&feed=dynamics365-commerce&view=versions&package=%40msdyn365-commerce-modules%2Fstarter-pack&protocolType=Npm)
- [SDK feed](https://dev.azure.com/commerce-partner/Registry/_packaging?_a=package&feed=dynamics365-commerce&view=versions&package=%40msdyn365-commerce%2Fbootloader&protocolType=Npm)
- [Retail Server proxy feed](https://dev.azure.com/commerce-partner/Registry/_packaging?_a=package&feed=dynamics365-commerce&view=versions&package=%40msdyn365-commerce%2Fretail-proxy&protocolType=Npm)

## Determine the versions deployed on an e-Commerce site

To determine the deployed versions of the SDK, module library, and Retail Server proxy that are used on an e-Commerce site, right-click a site page, select **View page source**, and then search for the following strings to find the version number:

- **commerceSDKVersion** – The SDK version.
- **commerceSSKVersion** – The module library version.
- **retailServerProxyVersion** – The Retail Server proxy version.

## Update the app.settings.json file

In the SDK **/src/settings** directory, there's a file called **app.settings.json**. This file surfaces global settings to Commerce site builder that are used by the module library set of modules and can contain additional settings for custom modules. The settings are located in site builder at **Site Settings \> Extensions**. 

When upgrading the module library, there may be new settings that are applicable and need to be added manually. The latest app.settings.json file can be found in the [online SDK GitHub settings directory](https://github.com/microsoft/Msdyn365.Commerce.Online/tree/master/src/settings). This file contains settings for the latest available module library. If you haven't made any additions to the app.settings.json file, you can copy the contents of this file to your version or do a diff and merge the new settings manually. If you're updating to an older module library, you can find the specific app.settings.json file under the specific build branch located on the [GitHub branches page](https://github.com/microsoft/Msdyn365.Commerce.Online/branches). You'll need to manually merge the contents to your app.settings.json file.

When a local configuration package is created by using the **yarn msdyn365 pack** command-line interface (CLI) tool, the local app.settings.json file updates will be included. The package that is created can then be uploaded to an online site by using Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). You will then see the new settings in the site builder tool.
