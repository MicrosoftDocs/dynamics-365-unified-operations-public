# Platform settings file

This topic covers the various properties that are configured in the platform settings file in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The **platform.settings.json** file under the **\\src\\settings\\** directory holds various platform property settings that are used by the Commerce e-commerce runtime. This file might not exist by default. If it doesn't exist, you can add it under the **\\src\\settings\\** directory. The following example of a **platform.settings.json** file shows various supported property settings.

```json
{
    "dataActionTimeoutInMs": 4000,
    "minClientChunkSize": 30000,
    "excludeModules": [ ],
    "namespaceExtensions" : [ ],
    "secretsManagerOUN" : 128
}
```

## dataActionTimeoutInMs

The **dataActionTimeoutInMs** property defines the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that data actions will wait for a response before they time out. The time-out represents a lower bound for page response, because the action framework will wait as long as the defined time-out before it times out and returns the page. The default value is 4,000 milliseconds (4 seconds).

## minClientChunkSize

The **minClientChunkSize** property defines the minimum size, in bytes, of webpack JavaScript chunks that will be sent to the browser. JavaScript chunks that are smaller than the minimum size will be grouped together to form chunks that are larger than the minimum size. The smaller the minimum size is, the more chunks will be generated. In this case, more code splitting will occur, and less unused JavaScript code will be included. However, many smaller chunks must be downloaded. By contrast, the larger the minimum size is, the fewer overall chunks will be generated. In this case, fewer JavaScript files must be downloaded, but some unused JavaScript code might be included. The default value is 30,000 bytes (30 KB).

## excludedModules

The **excludedModules** property defines a set of modules that will be excluded from webpack JavaScript chunks. Commerce modules are bundled into JavaScript chunks and sent to the browser on the client side. However, if modules aren't required on a site, they can be excluded to help reduce the size of JavaScript chunks and help increase the speed of page loads.

## namespaceExtensions

The **namespaceExtensions** property defines the supported namespaces that are used for module registration. By default, the only supported namespace is **@msdyn365-commerce-modules**. This namespace contains all the module library modules and the core set of modules. The module package name is defined in the following format: **\<namespace\>\/\<module_name\>**. If modules are published that use a new namespace, the namespace can be added to the settings.

## secretsManagerOUN

The **secretsManagerOUN** property specifies the operating unit number to use when retrieving secret values using the secret manager class. This operating unit number should match that of the store that was used in Commerce headquarters to configure key vault parameters for Retail Server. For more information, see [Set up Azure Key Vault for secure key management](set-up-key-vault.md).
