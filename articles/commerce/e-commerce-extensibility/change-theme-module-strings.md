# Change theme module strings

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to change module library strings from within a theme in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

In some cases, modules expose strings that are shown as configurations in a module that can be configured in Commerce site builder. However, other strings, such as the text that is shown for the sign-in button, might be hardcoded as module resource strings.

## Override resource strings for a theme

To override resource strings for a theme, use the pattern in the following example to modify the global.json resource file that is located in the src/resources/modules directory.

```json
"{ThemeNamespace}.{ThemeName}.{ResourceString}": {
    "value" : "",
    "_value.comment": ""
}
```

To learn more about how resource strings are created and how to create a global.json file if one doesn't exist in your software development kit (SDK), see [Localize a module](localize-module.md).

### Override resource strings for preinstalled themes

To override resource strings for preinstalled themes (for example, fabrikam or starter themes), use **@msdyn365-commerce-modules** as the theme namespace. The following example shows how to change the sign-in link text for the fabrikam theme.

```json
"@msdyn365-commerce-modules.fabrikam.signInLinkText": {
    "value": "Sign in now",
    "_value.comment": "Sign-in Link Text"
}
```

### Override resource strings for custom or local themes

For custom or local themes, use **\_\_local\_\_** as the theme namespace. The following example shows how to change the sign-in link text for a custom theme that is named "adventureworks."

```json
"__local__.adventureworks.signInLinkText": {
    "value": "Log in",
    "_value.comment": "Log in Link Text"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> For [shared themes](extend-theme.md), child themes inherit all the resources string overrides that are linked to the parent theme.
