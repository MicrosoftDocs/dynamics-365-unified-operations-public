# System requirements for a Dynamics 365 Commerce online extensibility development environment

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic lists the system requirements for setting up a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce online extensibility development environment. Before you install the online software development kit (SDK) and tools, you should verify that the system that you're working with meets or exceeds the minimum hardware and software requirements.

## Operating systems

The online extensibility development environment requires Windows 10 (the latest publicly available version).

## Memory and hard drive requirements

We recommend that you have 8 gigabytes (GB) or more of RAM and at least 20 GB of free hard drive space to run the online extensibility environment.

## Supported web browsers

The online extensibility development environment can preview customizations in any of the following web browsers:

* Google Chrome (up to the current version minus 1)
* Mozilla Firefox (up to the current version minus 1)
* Microsoft Edge (up to the current version minus 1)
