# Module React component file

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the module React component file in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The module React component file is a TypeScript (.ts) file that contains business logic and controls a module's view. The React **render()** method generates the module's HTML.  

The default template of a module breaks up the React component and view into two files: the module React component (MODULE_NAME.tsx)  and the module view file (MODULE_NAME.view.tsx). Generally, the React component file performs business logic and passes any data needed by the view into the view by using the **props** object. Themes separate the React component and view into two files to provide a view extension file that overrides the view for a module. This separation provides greater flexibility in changing a module's view based on the selected theme.

## Example 

The following example shows the default React component file for a new module.

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

import { IProductFeatureData } from './product-feature.data';
import { IProductFeatureProps } from './product-feature.props.autogenerated';

export interface IProductFeatureViewProps extends IProductFeatureProps<IProductFeatureData> {

}

/**
 *
 * ProductFeature component
 * @extends {React.PureComponent<IProductFeatureProps<IProductFeatureData>>}
 */
class ProductFeature extends React.PureComponent<IProductFeatureProps<IProductFeatureData>> {
    public render(): JSX.Element | null {

        return this.props.renderView(this.props);
    }
}

export default ProductFeature;
```

You can access configuration properties that you define in the module definition file (MODULE\_NAME.definition.json) and data properties file (MODULE\_NAME.data.ts) in the module view file by using the **this.props.config.\*** and **this.props.data.\*** application programming interface (API) properties.
