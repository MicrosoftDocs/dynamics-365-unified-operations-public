# Extend a theme from a base theme

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to extend a theme from a base theme for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce online site.

By using the Dynamics 365 Commerce online store extensibility software development kit (SDK), you can create either themes that are standalone themes or themes that are extended from a base theme. For example, you can have a base theme that defines Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) styles for modules, module view extensions, and module definition extensions. You can then have a different theme, or even a set of themes, that adds changes on top of the base theme. This capability is helpful when a single Dynamics 365 environment has multiple online sites that use different theme branding.

## Specify a base theme

To specify the base theme for a theme, edit the theme definition file, and add a **$ref** section that points to the base theme.

In the following example, the **$ref** section references the **fabrikam** sample theme that is included as part of the module library.

```json
{
    "$ref": "@msdyn365-commerce-modules/fabrikam-design-kit/dist/lib/modules/fabrikam/fabrikam.definition.json",
    "$type": "themeModule",
    "description": "This is SDK template theme module",
    "friendlyName": "adventureworks",
    "name": "adventureworks"
}
```

## Examples

In the following example, the **add-theme** command-line interface (CLI) command is used to create a base theme.

```console
yarn msdyn365 add-theme base
```

Here is the definition file for the base theme that is created.

**basetheme.definition.json**

```json
{
    "$type": "themeModule",
    "description": "This is SDK template theme module",
    "friendlyName": "base",
    "name": "base"
}
```

Next, the CLI command is used to create a theme that is named **extended**.

```console
yarn msdyn365 add-theme extended
```

The definition file for the extended theme can now reference the base theme by using a relative path, as shown here.

**extended.definition.json**

```json
{
    "$ref": "../base/base.definition.json",
    "$type": "themeModule",
    "description": "This is SDK template theme module",
    "friendlyName": "extended",
    "name": "extended"
}
```

### Include base theme styles

By default, base theme styles aren't included in the extended theme. To include the base theme styles, you can add a reference in the **extended.theme.scss** file, as shown here. This example also shows how to add other styles.

**extended.theme.scss**

```scss
@import "../../base/styles/base.theme.scss";

body {
    background-color: red;
}
```

The following example resembles the previous example. It shows that you can also add a reference to the base theme in the **extended.definition.scss.json** file, if you want.

**extended.definition.scss.json**

```json
{
    "$ref": "../../base/styles/base.definition.scss.json",
    "name": "extended"
}
```
