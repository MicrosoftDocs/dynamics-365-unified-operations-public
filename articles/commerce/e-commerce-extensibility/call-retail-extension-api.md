# Call Retail Server extension APIs

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to call Microsoft Dynamics 365 Retail Server extension application programming interfaces (APIs) from data actions or directly from module code.

## Overview

Dynamics 365 Retail Server extension APIs are usually implemented and called from the point of sale (POS) system. However, they can also be called from e-Commerce modules and data actions. To call the APIs in this way, you must create proxy module TypeScript (.ts) files by using a tool that is provided as part of the Dynamics 365 Retail software development kit (SDK). You can then include these files in your e-Commerce configurations and use them to call the Retail Server extension APIs from e-Commerce modules and data actions.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic doesn't explain how to create Retail Server extensions. For more information, see [Create a new Retail Server extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/retail/dev-itpro/retail-server-extension).

It's assumed that the following prerequisites are in place:

- A Retail Server extension has already been deployed.
- You have access to the Retail extension dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are available.

In addition, make sure that your .env file's **MSDyn365Commerce\_BASEURL** value points to the environment that has the deployed Retail extension, so that you can test against it. If this option isn't available, you can use mocks instead.

If you're developing on the local Retail Server virtual machine (VM), you must point **MSDyn365Commerce\_BASEURL** to the local URL (`https://usnconeboxax1ret.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com/`), and make sure that **MSDyn365Commerce\_CHANNELID** and **MSDyn365Commerce\_OUN** are set to the appropriate online channel that you're using. Here is an example of an .env file.

```text
…
MSDyn365Commerce_BASEURL=https://usnconeboxax1ret.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com/
MSDyn365Commerce_CHANNELID=68719478279
MSDyn365Commerce_CATALOGID=0
MSDyn365Commerce_OUN=128
…
```

You might also have to change the following setting in the Retail Server web.config file, so that the call can go through in the local development environment.

```code
<add key="AllowedOrigins" value="*" />
<!-- <add key="AllowedOrigins" value="https://usnconeboxax1pos.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com;https://usnconeboxax1ecom.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com" /> -->
```

For more information, see [Configure a development environment (.env) file](configure-env-file.md).

## Create proxy files

For information about how Retail extensions can be called from Retail POS, see [Typescript and C# proxies for Retail point of sale (POS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/retail/dev-itpro/typescript-proxy-retail-pos). That topic explains how to create a proxy file by using a command that resembles the following command.
 
```Console
C:\RetailSDK\SourceCode\RetailSDK\Code\References\CommerceProxyGenerator.10.9.19281.3\tools>
CommerceProxyGenerator.exe 

C:\RetailSDK\SourceCode\RetailSDK\Code\References\Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.Proxies.ExtensionsGenerator.9.18.19315.4\build\Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.RetailServerLibrary.dll c:\RetailSDK\SourceCode\RetailSDK\Code\References\RetailServer.Extensions.WarrantySample.dll /application:typescriptextensions
```

> [!NOTE]
> The SDK version that is referenced in the command might differ, depending on the version of Retail Server that you're running.

The process for creating proxy files for e-Commerce is similar, but the final **/application:typescriptextensions** option is replaced by **/application:typescriptmoduleextensions**, as shown in the following example.

```Console
C:\RetailSDK\SourceCode\RetailSDK\Code\References\CommerceProxyGenerator.10.9.19281.3\tools>
CommerceProxyGenerator.exe 

C:\RetailSDK\SourceCode\RetailSDK\Code\References\Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.Proxies.ExtensionsGenerator.9.18.19315.4\build\Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.RetailServerLibrary.dll C:\RetailSDK\SourceCode\RetailSDK\Code\References\RetailServer.Extensions.WarrantySample.dll /application:typescriptmoduleextensions
```

After you run the preceding command, two new files are generated: **DataActionExtension.g.ts** and **DataServiceEntities.g.ts**.

## Create a new data action

From the Dynamics 365 Commerce online SDK, include the two new files from the previous section in the **/src/actions/** directory. Then create a new data action .ts file, and paste in code that resembles the following example to call the Retail extension APIs from the data action. 

The following example uses a file that is named get-warranty-info.ts. Notice that it imports the DataActionExtension.g and DataServiceEntities.g files that were generated earlier, and it calls the **createGetWarrantyByProductIdInput** Retail extension API.

```typescript
import { createObservableDataAction, IAction, ICreateActionContext } from '@msdyn365-commerce/core';
import { retailAction } from '@msdyn365-commerce/retail-proxy';
import { createGetWarrantyByProductIdInput } from './DataActionExtension.g';
import { IProductWarranty } from './DataServiceEntities.g';

/**
 * Get Org Unit Configuration Data Action
 */
export default createObservableDataAction({
    action: <IAction<IProductWarranty[]>>retailAction,
    input: (context: ICreateActionContext) => {
        return createGetWarrantyByProductIdInput({ Paging: { Top: 250 } }, '12345');
    }
});
```

You can now call the data action just as you might call any other data action, by declaring it in the **dataActions** node of your module.definition.json file, as shown in the following example.

```json
{
    "$type": "contentModule",
    "friendlyName": "Warranty List",
    "name": "warrantylist",
    "description": "Provides a list of available warranty services available for purchase.",
    "categories": [
        "warranty"
    ],
    "tags": [
        ""
    ],
    "dataActions": {
        "productWarranties": {
            "path": "../../actions/get-warranty-info",
            "runOn": "server"
        }
    },
    "resources": {
        "warrantyName": {
            "value": "Warranty Name",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty name header"
        },
        "warrantyDescription": {
            "value": "Description",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty description header"
        },
        "warrantyPrice": {
            "value": "Price",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty price header"
        },
        "warrantyBuyButton": {
            "value": "Buy now",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty action button"
        }
    }
}
```

You must also add the return data type to the module's data.ts file, as shown in the following example.

```typescript
import { AsyncResult } from '@msdyn365-commerce/retail-proxy';
import { IProductWarranty } from '../../actions/DataServiceEntities.g';

export interface IWarrantylistData {
    productWarranties: AsyncResult<IProductWarranty[]>;
}
```

Finally, you can access the data from your module React component by using the **this.props.data.productWarranties** property.
