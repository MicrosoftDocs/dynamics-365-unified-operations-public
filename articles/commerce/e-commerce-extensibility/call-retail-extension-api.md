# Call Retail Server extension APIs

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to call Microsoft Dynamics 365 Retail Server extension application programming interfaces (APIs) from data actions or directly from module code.

## Overview

Dynamics 365 Retail Server extension APIs can be called from either the point of sale (POS) system or from e-Commerce modules and data actions. To call the APIs from e-Commerce modules and data actions, you must create proxy module TypeScript (.ts) files by using a tool that is provided as part of the Dynamics 365 Retail software development kit (SDK). You can then include these files in your e-Commerce configurations and use them to call the Retail Server extension APIs from e-Commerce modules and data actions.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic doesn't explain how to create Retail Server extensions. For more information, see [Create a new Retail Server extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/retail/dev-itpro/retail-server-extension).

It's assumed that the following prerequisites are in place:

- A Retail Server extension has already been deployed.
- You have access to the Retail Server extension dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are available.

In addition, make sure that the .env file **MSDyn365Commerce\_BASEURL** has a value that points to the environment that has the deployed Retail Server extension, so that you can test against it. If this option isn't available, you can use a mock-up instead.

If you're developing on the local Tier 1 Retail Server virtual machine (VM), you must point **MSDyn365Commerce\_BASEURL** to the local URL (`https://usnconeboxax1ret.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com/`), and make sure that **MSDyn365Commerce\_CHANNELID** and **MSDyn365Commerce\_OUN** are set to the appropriate online channel that you're using. Here is an example of an .env file.

```text
…
MSDyn365Commerce_BASEURL=https://usnconeboxax1ret.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com/
MSDyn365Commerce_CHANNELID=68719478279
MSDyn365Commerce_CATALOGID=0
MSDyn365Commerce_OUN=128
…
```
For more information, see [Configure a development environment (.env) file](configure-env-file.md).

You might also have to change the following setting in the Retail Server web.config file, so that the call can go through in the local development environment.

```code
<add key="AllowedOrigins" value="*" />
<!-- <add key="AllowedOrigins" value="https://usnconeboxax1pos.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com;https://usnconeboxax1ecom.cloud.onebox.dynamics.com" /> -->
```

## Create proxy files

You will need the Retail SDK to generate proxy files. If you are using a Tier 1 development VM environment, make sure that you have the latest Retail SDK installed. For more information, see [Migrate the Retail SDK from Visual Studio 2015 to Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/commerce/dev-itpro/retail-sdk/migrate-sdk).

For information about how Retail extensions can be called from Retail POS, see [Typescript and C# proxies for Retail point of sale (POS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/retail/dev-itpro/typescript-proxy-retail-pos). That topic explains how to create a proxy file by using a command that resembles the following command.
 
```Console
K:\RetailSDK\References\microsoft.dynamics.commerce.tools.coreproxygenerator\10.14.20128.1\tools>CommerceProxyGenerator.exe ..\..\..\microsoft.dynamics.commerce.tools.extensionsproxygenerator\9.22.20167.4\tools\Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.RetailServerLibrary.dll k:\WarrantySample\Contoso.RetailServer.WarrantySample.dll /application:typescriptextensions
```

> [!NOTE]
> The SDK version that is referenced in the command might differ, depending on the version of Retail Server that you're running.

The process for creating proxy files for e-Commerce is similar, but the final **/application:typescriptextensions** option is replaced by **/application:typescriptmoduleextensions**, as shown in the following example.

```Console
K:\RetailSDK\References\microsoft.dynamics.commerce.tools.coreproxygenerator\10.14.20128.1\tools>CommerceProxyGenerator.exe ..\..\..\microsoft.dynamics.commerce.tools.extensionsproxygenerator\9.22.20167.4\tools\Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.RetailServerLibrary.dll k:\WarrantySample\Contoso.RetailServer.WarrantySample.dll /application:typescriptmoduleextensions
```

After you run the preceding command, two new files are generated: **DataActionExtension.g.ts** and **DataServiceEntities.g.ts**.

### Proxy data methods

The proxy is closely linked to the data action framework. For every Retail Server extension API, there are two exposed proxy methods:

- **createInput** – This method creates an **IActionInput** class that can be used either to run a page load data action, or to do a direct state update or fetch via the **actionContext.update()** or **actionContext.get()** methods. This method is always named **create{COMMERCE_SCALE_UNIT_EXTENSION_API_NAME}Input**.
- **action** – This method can be invoked on its own as an event-based data action, or it can be added inside another action method to create a data action chain. This method is always named **{RETAIL_SERVER_API_NAME}Async**.

## Call a proxy API with a data action

From the Dynamics 365 Commerce online SDK, include the two new files from the previous section in the **/src/actions/** directory. Then create a new data action .ts file, and paste in code that resembles the following example to call the Retail Server extension APIs from the data action. 

The following example uses a file that is named **get-warranty-info.ts**. Notice that it imports the **DataActionExtension.g** and **DataServiceEntities.g** files that were generated earlier, and it calls the **createGetWarrantyByProductIdInput** Retail Server extension API as defined in the proxy file.

```typescript
import { createObservableDataAction, IAction, ICreateActionContext } from '@msdyn365-commerce/core';
import { retailAction } from '@msdyn365-commerce/retail-proxy';
import { createGetWarrantyByProductIdInput } from './DataActionExtension.g';
import { IProductWarranty } from './DataServiceEntities.g';
/**
 * Get Warranty Info Data Action
 */
export default createObservableDataAction({
    action: <IAction<IProductWarranty[]>>retailAction,
    input: (context: ICreateActionContext) => {
        return createGetWarrantyByProductIdInput({Paging:{Top:250}}, '12345');
    }
});
```

You can now call the data action just as you might call any other data action, by declaring it in the **dataActions** node of your module.definition.json file, as shown in the following example. The data action will be called at page load time.

```json
{
    "$type": "contentModule",
    "friendlyName": "Warranty List",
    "name": "warrantylist",
    "description": "Provides a list of available warranty services available for purchase.",
    "categories": [
        "warranty"
    ],
    "tags": [
        ""
    ],
    "dataActions": {
        "productWarranties": {
            "path": "../../actions/get-warranty-info",
            "runOn": "server"
        }
    },
    "resources": {
        "warrantyName": {
            "value": "Warranty Name",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty name header"
        },
        "warrantyDescription": {
            "value": "Description",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty description header"
        },
        "warrantyPrice": {
            "value": "Price",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty price header"
        },
        "warrantyBuyButton": {
            "value": "Buy now",
            "comment": "Text for the warranty action button"
        }
    }
}
```

You must also add the return data type to the module's data.ts file, as shown in the following example.

```typescript
import { AsyncResult } from '@msdyn365-commerce/retail-proxy';
import { IProductWarranty } from '../../actions/DataServiceEntities.g';

export interface IWarrantylistData {
    productWarranties: AsyncResult<IProductWarranty[]>;
}
```

Finally, you can access the data from your module React component by using the **this.props.data.productWarranties** property. The following example shows a sample module view.tsx file that renders data coming back from the Retail Server extension API.

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { IWarrantylistsampleViewProps } from './warrantylistsample';
export default (props: IWarrantylistsampleViewProps) => {
    const {
        data: { productWarranties }
    } = props;
    if (productWarranties && productWarranties.result) {
        return (
            <table className='table'>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Warranty</th>
                        <th>Price</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    {productWarranties.result.map(warranty => (
                        <tr>
                            <td>{warranty.Description}</td>
                            <td>${warranty.Price}</td>
                            <button type='button' className='btn btn-primary'>Buy Now</button>
                        </tr>
                    ))}
                </tbody>
            </table>
        );
    } else {
        return <div>No warranty info returned</div>;
    };
};
```

## Call proxy APIs directly

The following example shows a Retail Server API being called directly inside of a module's typescript React view code without using a data action.

```
import * as React from 'react';
import { getWarrantyByProductIdAsync } from '../../actions/DataActionExtension.g';
import { IWarrantylistViewProps } from './warrantylist';
export default (props: IWarrantylistViewProps) => {
    const _getWarrantyOnClick = async() => {
        getWarrantyByProductIdAsync({ callerContext: props.context.actionContext }, '12345').then( result => {
           ...
        });
    }
    
    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={_getWarrantyOnClick}>Get Warranty Info</button>
        </div>
    );    
};
```
