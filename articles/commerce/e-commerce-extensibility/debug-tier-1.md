# Debug against a Tier 1 Commerce development environment

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to set up an e-Commerce online development environment to debug against a Tier 1 Commerce development environment.

## Overview

Dynamics 365 Commerce Tier 1 environments are generally deployed for Commerce runtime (CRT) and point of sale (POS) extension development. These are standalone environments that do not include e-Commerce components due to the software as a service (SaaS) nature of the e-Commerce architecture.

There may be scenarios where you want to test calling extensions on a Tier 1 environment to allow extension debugging from e-Commerce components. This topic describes how to set up these kind of scenarios.

## Install the SDK

The Dynamics 365 Commerce software development kit (SDK) can be installed on any environment including the Tier 1 virtual machine (VM) itself. For setup instructions, see [Setup a development environment](setup-dev-environment.md).

## Configure the .env file

To hit the Tier 1 environment from the local node server on the e-Commerce development environment, set the **MsDyn365Commerce_BASEURL** variable value in the .env file to the Tier 1 Retail Server URL. For details about how to set up an .env file, see [Configure a development environment (.env) file](configure-env-file.md).

To obtain the Retail Server URL, go to the [Microsoft Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/) webpage and select the project and Tier 1 environment. Next, select **Login** at the top right and then select **Retail Server URL** as shown in the following illustration.

Selecting the **Retail Server URL** link should open a new tab with a URL similar to the following example URL: 

`https://e-comdevtestf1d01de665c744a7devret.cloud.retail.dynamics.com/Commerce`

Copy this URL, except for the last part "Commerce", into the .env file as the value for the **MsDyn365Commerce_BASEURL** variable. The remaining variables should be configured to a desired online channel on the environment. The following example shows configured variables using the URL that was noted above.  

```
…
MSDyn365Commerce_BASEURL=https://e-comdevtestf1d01de665c744a7devret.cloud.retail.dynamics.com/
MSDyn365Commerce_CHANNELID=68719478279
MSDyn365Commerce_CATALOGID=0
MSDyn365Commerce_OUN=128
…
```
Make sure to restart the Node.js server with a "yarn start" command so that the server picks up these new values. As you build modules and debug data actions, calls will now be made directly to the Tier 1 Retail Server.

If you have the **MSDyn365_HOST** variable value set to your e-Commerce site URL, you can also navigate to https://localhost:4000 to view your online website rendered on the local Node.js server. All data action Retail Server calls will be routed to the Tier 1 environment, as specified in the .env file.
