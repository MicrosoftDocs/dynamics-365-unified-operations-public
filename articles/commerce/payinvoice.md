# Set up pay invoice scenarios

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

The Pay invoice functionality in Dynamics 365 Commerce has been expanded to support:

- Payoff of multiple sales order invoices in a single POS transaction.
- Payment of various customer invoice types including free text invoices, project-based invoices, and credit notes.

To enable these scenarios, the functionality profile for stores must be configured as outlined in below.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> POS setup \> POS profiles \> Functionality profiles** and select a profile that's linked to the stores that you want to make the changes for.
2. On the **Functions** tab, configure the following parameters as needed.

    - **Sales order invoice** – Select **Yes** to allow users to pay one or more sales order-based invoices in a single POS transaction.
    - **Free text invoice** – Select **Yes** to allow users to pay one or more free text-based invoices in a single POS transaction.
    - **Project invoice** – Select **Yes** to allow users to pay one or more project-based invoices in a single POS transaction.
    - **Sales order credit note** – Select **Yes** to allow users to settle multiple sales order-based credit notes against open invoices or process a refund to the customer for an open credit note.

> [!NOTE]
> Payment or settlement of partial amounts is not yet supported.
