# Price FAQ

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article contains answers to frequently asked questions about pricing and discounts in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

### What pricing calculation scenarios are backed by the Commerce pricing engine?

- **In Commerce headquarters:** Call center sales order and Price simulator.
- **In Point of Sale (POS):** All operations.
- **In E-commerce:** All operations.

### How can I extend the Commerce pricing engine?

You can check out the latest Commerce software development kit (SDK) samples in the  `src/PricingEngine` folder of [microsoft\/Dynamics365Commerce\.Solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/).

### Why do I see the wrong price?

To diagnose your price and discount configurations, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce** \> **Pricing and discounts** \> **Price simulator**.
1. Set your price calculation context, including the channel, the customer (if there is one), and sales lines.
1. If you see the expected prices in Price simulator, your price and discount configurations are likely correct. To confirm that you've successfully synchronized your data to the Commerce Scale Unit, you can follow [Commerce Data Exchange best practices](dev-itpro/cdx-best-practices.md).

    If you **don't** see the expected prices in Price simulator, you must reevaluate your price and discount configurations, including price groups, loyalty, affiliation, and discounts.
