# Enable Azure Data Lake Storage in a Dynamics 365 Commerce environment

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to enable and test Azure Data Lake Storage for a Dynamics 365 Commerce environment, which is a prerequisite for enabling product recommendations.

## Overview

In the Dynamics 365 Commerce solution, all product and transaction information is tracked in the environment's Entity store. To make this data accessible to other Dynamics 365 services, such as data analytics, business intelligence, and personalized recommendations, it is necessary to connect the environment to a customer-owned Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 solution.

As Azure Data Lake Storage is configured in an environment, all necessary data is mirrored from the Entity store while still being protected and under customer's control.

If product recommendations or personalized recommendations are also enabled in the environment, then the product recommendations stack will be granted access to the dedicated folder in Azure Data Lake Storage to retrieve the customerâ€™s data and compute recommendations based on it.

## Prerequisites

Customers need to have Azure Data Lake Storage configured in an Azure subscription that they own. This topic does not cover the purchase of an Azure subscription or the setup of an Azure Data Lake Storage-enabled storage account.

For more information about Azure Data Lake Storage, see [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 official documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/data-lake).
  
## Configuration steps

This section covers the configuration steps necessary for enabling Azure Data Lake Storage in an environment as it relates to product recommendations.
For a more in-depth overview of the steps required to enable Azure Data Lake Storage, see [Make entity store available as a Data Lake](../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/entity-store-data-lake.md).

### Enable Azure Data Lake Storage in the environment

1. Log in to the environment's back office portal.
1. Search for **System Parameters** and navigate to the **Data connections** tab. 
1. Set **Enable Data Lake integration** to **Yes**.
1. Set **Trickle update Data Lake** to **Yes**.
1. Next, enter the following required information:
    1. **Application ID** // **Application Secret** // **DNS Name** - Needed to connect to KeyVault where the Azure Data Lake Storage secret is stored.
    1. **Secret name** - The secret name stored in KeyVault and used to authenticate with Azure Data Lake Storage.
1. Save your changes in the top left corner of the page.

The following image shows an example Azure Data Lake Storage configuration.

### Test the Azure Data Lake Storage connection

1. Test the connection to KeyVault using the **Test Azure Key Vault** link.
1. Test the connection to Azure Data Lake Storage using the **Test Azure Storage** link.

> [!NOTE]
> If the tests fail, double-check that all of the KeyVault information added above is correct, then try again.

Once the connection tests are successful, you must enable automatic refresh for Entity store.

To enable automatic refresh for Entity store, follow these steps.

1. Search for **Entity Store**.
1. In the list on the left, navigate to the **RetailSales** entry, and select **Edit**.
1. Ensure that **Automatic Refresh Enabled** is set to **Yes**, select **Refresh**, and then select **Save**.

The following image shows an example of Entity store with automatic refresh enabled.

Azure Data Lake Storage is now configured for the environment. 

If not completed already, follow the steps for [enabling product recommendations and personalization](enable-product-recommendations.md) for the environment.
