You can study sales trends and patterns in real time in Dynamics 365 Commerce.

As part of Commerce, users can study sales trends and patterns in real time across different levels of the organization hierarchy over a period of years by using the out-of-box **Channel sales by year** report. You can open this report from any of the following locations:

- **Store management** workspace &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Store management** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Channel sales by year report**
- **Store financials** workspace &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Store financials** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Channel sales by year report**
- **Inquiries and reports** section &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales reports** &gt; **Channel sales by year report**

Users can also study sales trends and patterns by hour across different levels of the organization hierarchy over a selected period by using the out-of-box **Channel sales by hour** report. You can open this report from any of the following locations:

- **Store management** workspace &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Store management** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Channel sales by hour report**
- **Store financials** workspace &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Store financials** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Channel sales by hour report**
- **Inquiries and reports** section &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales reports** &gt; **Channel sales by hour report**
