This topic describes how to create a new call center channel in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

In Dynamics 365 Commerce, a call center is a type of retail channel that can be defined in the application. Defining a channel for your call center entities allows the system to tie specific data and order processing defaults to sales orders. A company can define multiple call center channels in Commerce. 

Before you create a new call center channel, ensure that you have completed the [Channel set up prerequisites](channels-prerequisites.md).

## Create and configure a new call center channel

To create and configure a new call center channel, follow these steps.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules \> Channels \> Call centers \> All call centers**.
1. On the action pane, select **New**.
1. In the **Name** field, provide a name for the new channel.
1. Select the appropriate **Legal entity** from the drop down.
1. Select the appropriate **Warehouse** location from the drop down.
1. In the **Default customer** field, provide a valid default customer.
1. In the **Email notification profile** field, provide a valid email notification profile.

1. On the action pane, select **New**.
1. In the navigation pane, select a desired payment method.

### Set up modes of delivery

You can see the configured modes of delivery by selecting **Modes of delivery** from the **Set up** tab on the **Action pane**.  

To change or add a mode of delivery, follow these steps.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules \> Inventory management \> Modes of delivery**.
1. On the action pane, select **New** to create a new mode of delivery, or select an existing mode.
