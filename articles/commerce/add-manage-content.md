This topic provides information about how to add and manage content on your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site.

## Overview

There are many ways to change the look, feel, and content of your site. Depending on the required level of customization, many of these changes can be implemented by non-developers. For example, no code has to be written to build templates, select themes, and select and configure modules. By contrast, development skills are required to create a new theme or module, because the e-Commerce software development kit (SDK) and the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) deployment workflow must be used.

The following topics provide detailed information about how to add and manage site content. They focus on areas of your site that don't require a developer. As required, they point out tasks that require SDK work.

- To change the text, images, or video on an existing site page, see [Work with modules](work-with-modules.md).
- To help guarantee a foolproof, on-brand authoring experience for web content authors, see [Work with templates](work-with-templates.md).
- To rearrange sections on a site page, see [Work with layouts](work-with-layouts.md).
- To change the fonts, colors, and general look of site pages, see [Select a site theme](select-site-theme.md).
