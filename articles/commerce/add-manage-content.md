# Ways to add content


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview and links to documentation about how to manage content using the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder web authoring toolset.

## Overview

There are many ways to change the look, feel, and content of your site. Depending on the required level of customization, many of these changes can be implemented by non-developers within site builder, the web authoring toolset included with Dynamics 365 Commerce. Site builder enables you to build templates, select themes, and select and configure modules without writing any code. By contrast, development skills are required to create a new theme or module, because the e-Commerce software development kit (SDK) and the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) deployment workflow must be used.

The following topics are good jumping off points to start understanding how to add and manage site content. Most of the topics listed focus on areas of your site that don't require a developer. Some address basic content editing, while others focus on site administrator tasks. Each of these topics will denote specific tasks might require SDK work. Each topic assumes that you have already provisioned a site and been granted access to the site builder toolset for your site.

Select one of the following topics to get started.
