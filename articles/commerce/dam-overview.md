# Digital asset management overview

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of digital asset management in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder.

## Overview

Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder's Media Library features rich digital asset management functionality, including support for the following:
- Image assets
- Video assets
- Other types of binary assets, such as Office documents and PDF files
- Localized images
- Folder uploads
- Cropping of images
- Customizing of image focal points
- Omni-channel image assets (product, product variants, catalog, category, worker, and customer images)

Digital assets are channel-specific, with the exception of omni-channel assets, which are environment-wide by default. 

Digital assets and management features are located within site builder under **Media Library** on the left navigation pane within a site.
