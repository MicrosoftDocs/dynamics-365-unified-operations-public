# Digital asset management overview

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides an overview of digital asset management in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder.

Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder's Media Library features rich digital asset management functionality, including support for the following:
- Image assets
- Video assets
- Other types of binary assets, such as Office documents and PDF files
- Localized images
- Folder uploads
- Cropping of images
- Customizing of image focal points
- Omni-channel image assets (product, product variants, catalog, category, worker, and customer images)

Digital assets are channel-specific, with the exception of omni-channel assets, which are environment-wide by default. 

Digital assets and management features are located within site builder under **Media Library** on the left navigation pane within a site.
