This topic describes how to enable "shop similar looks" product recommendations in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

The "shop similar looks" recommendations feature in Dynamics 365 Commerce uses the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML) to deliver recommendations for visually similar products to customers. By making "shop similar looks" recommendations available for all retail channels in Commerce, retailers can increase customer satisfaction by helping customers easily find what they want.

The functionality for "shop similar looks" recommendations uses product images of seed product variants to find and recommend visually similar products in a retailer's product catalog. 

"Shop similar looks" recommendations are available in both the point of sale (POS) and e-Commerce experiences.

### Example scenarios

- A customer views a black striped sweater and receives a recommendation for a similar sweater in red. The customer selects the recommended product instead of the originally viewed product and then receives recommendations for similar products in red. 
- A customer uses "shop similar looks" recommendations to discover matching earrings for a ring that the customer is interested in buying.
