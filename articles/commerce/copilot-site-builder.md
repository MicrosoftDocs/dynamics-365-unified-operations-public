If you run an e-commerce website, you know the importance of engaging and persuasive product enrichment and marketing content that can attract and convert your customers. However, it can be time-consuming and challenging to create such content, especially if you have a large product catalog and a diverse audience. To help with content creation, Microsoft introduced Copilot in site builder, a new AI-powered tool that helps you easily and efficiently generate high-quality content.

Copilot in site builder works seamlessly with Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder to help you quickly create product enrichment and marketing content that's tailored to your target audience and brand tone. Site builder offers a range of templates, features, and tools to help you customize your website to meet your needs and preferences. By using Copilot in site builder, you can quickly and efficiently generate persuasive, compelling, and engaging product enrichment and marketing content for your e-commerce websites.

The following video provides an overview of product enrichment with Copilot in site builder.

To use Copilot in site builder to initiate the creative process, first select a tone that's aligned to your brand, such as "adventurous," "luxurious," or "bold." Next, select an audience from a list of choices that you manage, such as "sports enthusiast" or "college graduate." Copilot then uses these prompts to craft compelling and engaging content based on existing product information such as the name, description, attributes, and price.

Copilot in site builder offers the following capabilities:

- **Initiate the creative process** – Copilot generates content based on basic product information such as the name, description, attributes, and dimensions. You can then use the generated content to spark further ideas.
- **Optimize for search engines** – Optimize your product marketing content for search engines to help rank your e-commerce site rank higher in internet search results and drive up sales.
- **Choose the messaging tone** – You can select the voice that best fits your brand and audience, and you can specify a unique tone for each product. For example, the tone of the messaging for a product might be adventurous, casual, luxurious, formal, informational, or educational.
- **Create custom messages for specific buyers** – Select the intended audience to create custom messages for specific buyers, such as new parents, graduates, senior citizens, and health care workers.
- **Amplify with key highlights** – Use natural language to augment your content with key highlights that are specific to a product, and generate engaging text snippets that help amplify key highlights for your product.
- **Make basic modifications** – Easily make basic text modifications, either by using an inline rich text editor or by using natural language to provide key prompts to format text.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot in site builder can be used with content block and text block modules when you enrich product pages. For more information, see [Learn more about standard product enrichment](./enrich-product-page.md).

## Selective content filtering

Microsoft is committed to providing a responsible and ethical solution for your e-commerce needs. We designed Copilot in site builder so that, by default, it avoids promoting products from sensitive and regulated industries, such as alcohol, tobacco, and soft drugs.

However, you might have different preferences and requirements for your business. Site administrators can override the default content filtering settings and customize the product enrichment and marketing content that Copilot in site builder generates.

To override content filtering restrictions in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Site settings \> Copilot**.
1. Under **Content filtering**, for the content themes that you want to override, set the options to **Off**.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot settings for tones, target clients, and sensitive/regulated industries are predefined by the system. If you have feedback or requests to revise or add more options, contact Microsoft Support.

For example, you can tell Copilot to highlight the benefits of the product using a friendly tone, or targeting a specific audience. If you don't provide any instructions, Copilot uses the default options from your site settings.
1. After processing, review the content Copilot generated in the **Copilot suggested enrichment content** preview box.
1. If you aren't satisfied with the response, in the text box, add more details for Copilot to use, and then select the right-facing arrow to generate updated content. You can also return to **Update product information** and change the selection of product information if needed. 
1. After Copilot creates a new response based on your updated input, you can repeat the process as many times as necessary until you get a response that meets your expectations.
1. Once you're satisfied with the response, select **Use response**, which copies the response to the text or content block you're updating. If needed, you can review and edit the response again to make any final changes, and also add images, links, or other elements to enhance the product page.
1. When you're finished, select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.
