# Configure sales tax for online orders

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides an overview of sales tax group selection for different online order types using either destination-based or customer account-based tax settings. 

You may want your e-commerce channel to support options like delivery or pickup for online orders. The sales tax applicability is based on the option selected by your online customers. 

## Destination-based taxes for online orders

In general, taxes for online orders that ship to customer addresses are defined by the destination. Every sales tax group has a retail destination-based tax configuration in which your business can define destination details, such as country or region, state, county, and city in a hierarchical form.

### Orders delivered to customer address

When an online order is placed, the Commerce tax engine uses the delivery address of every line item in the order and finds sales tax groups with matching destination-based tax criteria. For example, for an online order with a line item delivery address to San Francisco, California, the tax engine will find the sales tax group and sales tax code for California and then calculate tax for each line item accordingly.

### Order pick up in store

For order lines with pick up in store or curbside pickup specified, the tax group from the selected pickup store will be applied. For details about how to set up sales taxes for a given store, see [Set other tax options for stores](/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-other-tax-options-for-stores).

## Customer account-based taxes for online orders

There may be a business scenario where you want to configure a sales tax group on a specific customer account in Commerce headquarters. There are two places in headquarters where you can configure sales tax on a customer account. To access these, you'll first need to get to a customer detail page by going to **Retail and Commerce \> Customers \> All customers** and then selecting a customer.

The two places where you configure sales tax for a customer account are:

- **Sales tax group** on the **Invoice and delivery** FastTab of the customer details page . 
- **Sales tax** on the **General** FastTab of the **Manage addresses** page. To get there from the customer details page, select a specific address under the **Addresses** FastTab and then select **Advanced**.

> [!TIP]
> For online customer orders, if you only want to apply the destination-based taxes and avoid customer account-based taxes, ensure that the **Sales tax group** field is empty on the **Invoice and delivery** FastTab of the customer details page. To ensure that new customers who sign up using the online channel do not inherit the sales tax group settings from default customer or customer group settings, ensure that the **Sales tax group** field is also empty for the online channel default customer settings and customer group settings (**Retail and Commerce \> Customers \> Customer groups**).

## Determine destination-based tax or customer account-based tax applicability 

The following table explains whether destination-based taxes or customer account-based taxes are applied for online orders. 

| Customer type | Shipping address                   | Customer > Invoice and delivery > Sales tax group? | Address on customer account in headquarters? | Customer address > Advanced > General > Sales tax group?                                              | Sales tax group applied      |
