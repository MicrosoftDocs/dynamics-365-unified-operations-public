This article describes how to crop images in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder.

The Commerce site builder Media Library allows you to crop images to optimize them for different module types and viewports.

## Crop an image

To crop an image in site builder, follow these steps.

1. In the left navigation pane of Commerce site builder, select **Media Library**.
1. In the main window, select the image you want to modify.
1. On the command bar, select **Edit**.
1. Select the image to enter **Edit Mode**.
1. Under **Edit Mode**, select **Edit View by Module**.
1. From the **Module** drop-down menu, select the module type.
1. From the **View type** drop-down menu, select the view type.
1. From the **Placement** drop-down menu, select the image placement.
1. From the **Viewport** drop-down menu, select the viewport size.
1. The image is overlaid with the area representing the crop region. Move and resize the crop region as needed. The aspect ratio will be maintained automatically.
1. When you're done, on the command bar, select **Save**, and then select **Finish editing**. 

After custom cropping is completed, image modifications will take effect almost immediately.
