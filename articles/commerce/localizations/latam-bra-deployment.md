This topic covers how to set up and deploy the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for Brazil.

The Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for Brazil includes several extensions of the following Commerce components: the Commerce runtime (CRT), Retail Server, and point of sale (POS). These extensions let you calculate Brazil-specific taxes, generate electronic fiscal documents for retail sales, print DANFE (Documento Auxiliar de Nota Fiscal Eletrônica) and CF-e-SAT (Cupom Fiscal Eletrônico - Sistema Autenticador e Transmissor de Cupons Fiscais Eletrônicos) fiscal receipts that have custom fields, manage Brazil-specific customer information, and issue sales in offline contingency mode where registration of electronic fiscal documents is postponed. For more information about the Commerce localization for Brazil, see [Brazilian localization scope](../../finance/localizations/latam-bra-scope.md) and [Commerce localization for Brazil](latam-bra-commerce-localization.md).

The extensions that are described in this topic were developed based on the fiscal integration framework. For information about the fiscal integration functionality, see [Overview of fiscal integration for Commerce channels](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md). [Electronic reporting (ER)](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting) is used to implement formats for Brazilian electronic fiscal documents.

## Enable Brazil-specific Commerce functionality

This section describes how to configure Commerce headquarters settings that are specific to and recommended for Brazil. For more information, see the [Commerce home page](../index.md).

To enable and use the Brazil-specific functionality, you must configure the following settings in Commerce headquarters.

1. In the primary address of the legal entity, set the **Country/region** field to **BRA** (Brazil).
1. In the POS functionality profile of every store that is located in Brazil, set the **ISO code** field to **BR** (Brazil).

## Configure a production environment

This section provides deployment guidance that will help you enable Commerce components of the Commerce localization for Brazil.

> [!NOTE]
> Some steps in these procedures vary, depending on the product version that you're using. For more information, see [What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Retail](../get-started/whats-new-home-page.md).

### Use certificates for authentication with the tax authority service and digital signing of fiscal documents

A digital certificate for Application Object Server (AOS) must be stored in Azure Key Vault.

Digital certificates for Retail Server must be installed locally or stored in Key Vault. Both location types for Retail Server can also be configured simultaneously and used according to their priorities.

For more information about how to work with Key Vault storage, see [Get started with Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started) and [Set up the Azure Key Vault client](../../finance/localizations/setting-up-azure-key-vault-client.md).

You can also use the [User-defined certificate profiles for retail stores](./certificate-profiles-for-retail-stores.md) feature that supports failover to offline when Key Vault or Commerce headquarters isn't available. This feature extends the [Manage secrets for retail channels](../dev-itpro/manage-secrets.md) feature.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable NFC-e documents to be signed in offline contingency mode, you must install a certificate in the offline certificate storage of the POS. For more information, see [Make a cash-and-carry sale of goods in offline contingency mode](latam-bra-nfce.md#scenario-3-make-a-cash-and-carry-sale-of-goods-in-offline-contingency-mode) and [Postponed registration of NFC-e issued in contingency mode](latam-bra-nfce-contingency-mode.md).

#### Configure certificates so that they can be used in Retail Server

The Brazilian tax service extension of Retail Server uses a certificate for authentication with the tax authority service and digital signing of fiscal documents. The settings for Retail Server certificates are controlled by certificate profiles.

To configure certificates so that they can be used in Retail Server, follow these steps.

1. Go to **System administration \> Setup \> Certificate profiles**.
1. Create a certificate profile for the appropriate legal entities.
1. For each legal entity, select **Settings**, and then follow these steps:

    - For the local certificate, create a record where the **Location type** field is set to **Local certificate**. Then, in the **Thumbprint** field, enter a value.
    - For the Key Vault certificate, create a record where the **Location type** field is set to **Key Vault**, and then select **Key Vault certificate**.

Certificates can be installed in the local certificate storage of the machine where Retail Server is deployed or in Key Vault. Alternatively, they can be installed in both location types and configured simultaneously so that they are used according to their priorities.

#### Configure a certificate in AOS

A certificate for authentication with the tax authority service is stored in Key Vault. This certificate is used in AOS to submit, through Commerce headquarters, NFC-e documents that were issued in POS in offline contingency mode. The certificate is also required for digital signing of "discard" and "cancellation by substitution" requests. Parameters of the certificate must be specified in the fiscal establishment settings.

To configure a certificate in AOS, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Organizations \> Fiscal establishments \> Fiscal establishments**.
1. Select the appropriate digital certificate for authentication with the tax authority service and digital signing of fiscal documents.

> [!NOTE]
> After the setup is completed, the appropriate distribution jobs must be run in Commerce headquarters.

### Set up the SAT activation code

The SAT activation code enables communication between the POS register and the SAT device. The SAT hardware attribute contains the activation code for the SAT serial number that was entered during SAT device activation. That SAT hardware attribute must be associated with the POS register. 

To create the SAT hardware attribute, follow these steps.

1. Go to **System administration \> Setup \> Key Vault parameters**.
1. Create a record for the SAT activation code.
1. Add a secret that is named **ActivationCode**.
1. In the **Secret** field, enter value.
1. In the **Secret type** field, select **Manual**.

### Configure CRT extension components

> [!WARNING]
> Because of limitations of the [new independent packaging and extension model](../dev-itpro/build-pipeline.md), it can't currently be used with this localization functionality. You must use the previous version of the Retail software development kit (SDK) on a developer virtual machine (VM) in LCS. (Microsoft plans to add support for localization functionality to the new independent packaging and extension model in later versions.)
