# Fiscal printer integration sample for Russia

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides an overview of the fiscal integration sample for Russia in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The Dynamics 365 Commerce functionality for Russia includes a sample integration of the point of sale (POS) with a fiscal printer. This sample extends the [fiscal integration functionality](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md) and supports the application programming interface (API) of fiscal printers from [ATOL](http://integration.atol.ru/). It enables communication with a fiscal printer that is connected via a communication (COM) port by using a native software driver. The sample is provided in the form of source code and is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK).

Microsoft doesn't release any hardware, software, or documentation from ATOL. For information about how to obtain and operate the fiscal printer, contact [ATOL](https://www.atol.ru/).

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code is intended to be used with specific cash register software from ATOL, a third party. You're responsible for your use of ATOL services, and any use is subject to a separate [end user agreement](http://integration.atol.ru/eula/) between you and ATOL. It's important that you understand that ATOL might have different data handling, compliance, and security standards than Dynamics 365 Commerce. Your privacy is important to us. To learn more, read our [Privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839).

For more information about Commerce features that are available to customers in Russia, see [Commerce localization for Russia](rus-commerce-localization.md).

## Scenarios

The following scenarios are covered by the fiscal printer integration sample for Russia.

### Sales scenarios

- Print a fiscal receipt for cash-and-carry sales and returns.
- Capture a response from the fiscal printer, and store it in the channel database.
- Taxes:

    - Map tax rates to the fiscal printer's tax types.
    - Transfer mapped tax data to the fiscal printer.

- Payments:

    - Map the store's payment methods to the fiscal printer's payment types.
    - Print payments on a fiscal receipt.
    - Print change information.

- Print line discount information.
- Send the customer information that is specified for a sales transaction together with a fiscal receipt. An example of this information is the customer's email address. For more information, see [Customer information management for Russia](rus-customer-information.md).

### Daily reports

- Fiscal X and fiscal Z reports.

### Error handling

- Retry fiscal registration, if possible, in situations where the fiscal printer isn't connected, ready, or responding, the printer is out of paper, or a paper jam occurs.
- Postpone fiscal registration.
- Skip fiscal registration, or mark the transaction as registered, and include info codes to capture the reason for the failure and additional information.
- Check the availability of the fiscal printer before a new sales transaction is opened or a sales transaction is finalized.

## Limitations of the sample

- The fiscal printer supports only scenarios where sales tax is included in the price. Therefore, the **Price include sales tax** option must be set to **Yes** for both stores and customers.
- Fiscal receipts can't currently be printed for customer order operations (for example, deposit, pickup, or ship). However, support for customer order operations might be added in later versions.
- Fiscal receipts can't currently be printed for petty cash operations (for example, tender declaration, float entry, or tender removal). However, support for petty cash operations might be added in later versions.
- Daily reports (fiscal X and fiscal Z) are printed by using the fiscal printer's embedded format.
- The fiscal printer doesn't support mixed transactions. The **Prohibit mixing sales and returns in one receipt** option should be set to **Yes** in POS functionality profiles.

## Default data mapping

The following default data mapping is included in the fiscal document provider configuration that is provided as part of the fiscal integration sample:

- Payment method mapping:

    ```json
    {
        "PaymentMethods": [
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"1", "AtolPaymentType":0},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"2", "AtolPaymentType":4},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"3", "AtolPaymentType":1},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"4", "AtolPaymentType":3},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"5", "AtolPaymentType":0},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"6", "AtolPaymentType":0},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"7", "AtolPaymentType":4},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"8", "AtolPaymentType":4},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"10", "AtolPaymentType":4},
            {"StorePaymentMethod":"11", "AtolPaymentType":4}
        ]
    }
    ```

    The default payment method mapping is based on the store payment method configuration in demo data. You might have to modify the mapping in the connector functional profile, based on the settings of payment methods for your stores. For more information about payment types that ATOL fiscal printers support, see the [ATOL integration documentation](http://integration.atol.ru/).
