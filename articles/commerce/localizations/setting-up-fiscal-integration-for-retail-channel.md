# Set up the fiscal integration for Commerce channels

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides guidelines for setting up the fiscal integration functionality for Commerce channels. For more information about the fiscal integration, see [Overview of fiscal integration for Commerce channels](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md).

## Set up Commerce parameters

1. On the **Commerce shared parameters** page, on the **General** tab, set the **Enable fiscal integration** option to **Yes**.
1. On the **Number sequences** tab, define the number sequences for the following references:

    - Fiscal technical profile number
    - Fiscal connector group number
    - Registration process number

1. On the **Commerce parameters** page, define the number sequence for the fiscal functional profile number.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Number sequences are optional. Numbers for all fiscal integration entities can be generated either from number sequences or manually.

## Set up a fiscal registration process

The process of setting up the fiscal integration includes the following tasks:

- Configure fiscal connectors that represent fiscal devices or services that are used for fiscal registration purposes, such as fiscal printers.
- Configure document providers that generate fiscal documents that will be registered in fiscal devices or services by fiscal connectors.
- Configure the fiscal registration process that defines a sequence of fiscal registration steps and the fiscal connectors and fiscal document providers that are used for each step.
- Assign the fiscal registration process to point of sale (POS) functionality profiles.
- Assign connector technical profiles to hardware profiles.
- Assign connector technical profiles to POS hardware or functionality profiles.

### Upload configurations of fiscal document providers

A fiscal document provider is responsible for generating fiscal documents that represent transactions and events that are registered on the POS in a format that is also used for the interaction with a fiscal device or service. For example, a fiscal document provider might generate a representation of a fiscal receipt in an XML format.

To upload configurations of fiscal document providers, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to the **Fiscal document providers** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal document providers**).
1. Upload an XML configuration for each device or service that you plan to use.

> [!TIP]
> By selecting **View**, you can view all functional profiles that are related to the current fiscal document provider.

> [!NOTE]
> Data mapping is considered part of a fiscal document provider. To set up different data mappings for the same connector (for example, state-specific regulations), you should create different fiscal document providers.

### Upload configurations of fiscal connectors

A fiscal connector is responsible for the communication with a fiscal device or service. For example, a fiscal connector might send a fiscal receipt that a fiscal document provider created in an XML format to a fiscal printer. For more details about fiscal integration components, see [Fiscal registration process and fiscal integration samples for fiscal devices and services](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#fiscal-registration-process-and-fiscal-integration-samples-for-fiscal-devices-and-services).

To upload configurations of fiscal connectors, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to the **Fiscal connectors** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal connectors**).
1. Upload an XML configuration for each device or service that you plan to use for fiscal integration purposes.

> [!TIP]
> By selecting **View**, you can view all functional and technical profiles that are related to the current fiscal connector.

For examples of configurations of fiscal connectors and fiscal document providers, see [Fiscal integration samples in the Commerce SDK](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#fiscal-integration-samples-in-the-commerce-sdk).

### Create connector functional profiles

To create connector functional profiles, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to the **Connector functional profiles** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Connector functional profiles**).
1. For each combination of a fiscal connector and a fiscal document provider that is related to this fiscal connector, create a connector functional profile by following these steps:

    1. Select a connector name.
    1. Select a document provider.

#### Change data mapping parameters in a connector functional profile

You can change the data mapping parameters in a connector functional profile. The following table provides some examples of data mapping parameters in a connector functional profile.

| Parameter | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| VAT rates settings | value : VATrate | 1 : 2000, 2 : 1800 |
| VAT codes mapping | VATcode : value | vat20 : 1, vat18 : 2 |
| Tender types mapping | TenderType : value | Cash : 1, Card : 2 |

To restore the default parameters that are defined in the fiscal document provider configuration, select **Update** on the **Connector functional profiles** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Connector functional profiles are company-specific. If you plan to use the same combination of a fiscal connector and a fiscal document provider for different companies, you should create a connector functional profile for each company.

### Create connector technical profiles

To create connector technical profiles, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to the **Connector technical profiles** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Connector technical profiles**).
1. Create a connector technical profile for each fiscal connector by following these steps:

    1. Select a connector name.
    1. Select a connector type:

        - For devices or services that are connected to a Hardware station or present in the local network, select **Local**.
        - For external services, select **External**.
        - For internal connectors in the Commerce runtime (CRT), select **Internal**. 

    1. Select a connector location:

        - If the connector is located on the Hardware station, select **Hardware station**.
        - If the connector is located on the POS register, select **Register**.

Parameters on the **Device** and **Settings** tabs in a connector technical profile can be changed. To restore the default parameters that are defined in the fiscal connector configuration, select **Update**. While a new version of an XML configuration is loading, you will receive a message that states that the current fiscal connector or fiscal document provider is already being used. This procedure doesn't override manual changes that were previously made in connector functional profiles and connector technical profiles. To apply the default set of parameters from a new configuration, select **Update** on either the **Connector functional profiles** page or the **Connector technical profiles** page.

If you must set up specific parameters for an individual POS register or store, follow these steps.

1. Select the **Override** menu item.
1. On the **Override** page, create a new record.
1. Select a store or a POS register. You can override parameters of the selected technical profile for an individual POS register or all POS registers in an individual store.
1. On the **Device** tab, enter parameters for the selected POS register or store.

### Create fiscal connector groups

A fiscal connector group combines functional profiles of fiscal connectors that perform identical functions and are used at the same step of a fiscal registration process. For example, if several fiscal printer models can be used in a store, fiscal connectors for those fiscal printers can be combined in a fiscal connector group.

To create a fiscal connector group, follow these steps.

1. Go to the **Fiscal connector group** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal connector groups**).
1. Create a new fiscal connector group.
1. Add functional profiles to the connector group. On the **Functional profiles** tab, select **Add**, and select a profile number. Each fiscal connector in a connector group can have only one functional profile.
1. To suspend use of the functional profile, set the **Disable** option to **Yes**. This change affects only the current connector group. You can continue to use the same functional profile in other connector groups.

### Create a fiscal registration process

A fiscal registration process is defined by the sequence of registration steps and the connector group that is used for each step.

To create a fiscal registration process, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to the **Fiscal registration process** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal registration processes**).
1. Create a new record for each unique fiscal registration process.
1. Add registration steps to the process by following these steps:

    1. Select **Add**.
    1. Select a fiscal connector type.
    1. In the **Group number** field, select an appropriate fiscal connector group.

### Assign entities of the fiscal registration process to POS profiles

To assign entities of the fiscal registration process to POS profiles, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to the **POS functionality profiles** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> POS setup \> POS profiles \> Functionality profiles**). 
1. Assign the fiscal registration process to a POS functionality profile.
1. Select **Edit**, and then, on the **Fiscal registration process** tab, in the **Process number** field, select a process.
1. On the **Fiscal services** tab, select connector technical profiles with the connector location **Register**.
1. Go to the **POS hardware profile** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> POS setup \> POS profiles \> Hardware profiles**).
1. Assign connector technical profiles to a hardware profile. 
1. Select **Edit**, and then, on the **Fiscal peripherals** tab, add a line. 
1. In the **Profile number** field, select a connector technical profile.
1. On the **Fiscal peripherals** tab, select connector technical profiles with the connector location **Hardware station**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add several technical profiles to the same hardware profile. However, a hardware profile or POS functionality profile should have only one intersection with any fiscal connector group.

The fiscal registration flow is defined by the fiscal registration process and also by some parameters of fiscal integration components: the CRT extension for the fiscal document provider and the Hardware station extension for the fiscal connector.

- The subscription of events and transactions to fiscal registration is predefined in the fiscal document provider.
- The fiscal document provider is also responsible for identifying the fiscal connector that is used for fiscal registration. It matches the connector functional profiles that are included in the fiscal connector group that is specified for the current step of the fiscal registration process with the connector technical profile that is assigned to the hardware profile of the Hardware station that the POS is paired to.
- The fiscal document provider uses the data mapping settings from the fiscal document provider configuration to transform transaction/event data such as taxes and payments while a fiscal document is generated.
- When the fiscal document provider generates a fiscal document, the fiscal connector can either send it to the fiscal device as is, or parse it and transform it into a sequence of commands of the device application programming interface (API), depending on how the communication is handled.

### Set up registers with fiscal registration restrictions

You can select registers where fiscal registration is prohibited, for example in cases where you need to provide only non-fiscal operations such as product catalog search, customer lookup, or transaction draft creation on these devices.

To set up registers with fiscal registration restrictions, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal registration processes**.
1. Select the required process.
1. Select the **POS registers with fiscal process restrictions** tab.
1. Add registers with fiscal process restrictions as needed.

### Validate the fiscal registration process

It is recommended that you validate the fiscal registration process in the following cases:

- You've completed all the settings for a new registration process. These settings include assignment of registration processes to POS functionality profiles and hardware profiles.
- You've made changes to an existing fiscal registration process, and those changes might cause a different fiscal connector to be selected at runtime. (For example, you've changed the connector group for a fiscal registration process step, enabled a connector functional profile in a connector group, or added a new connector functional profile to a connector group.)
- You've made changes in the assignment of connector technical profiles to hardware profiles.

To validate the fiscal registration process, follow these steps.

1. In Commerce headquarters, go to the **Fiscal registration process** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal registration processes**).
1. Select **Validate** to validate the fiscal registration process.
1. On the **Distribution schedule** page, run the **1070** and **1090** jobs to transfer data to the channel database.

## Set up fiscal texts for discounts

In some cases, a special text must be printed on a fiscal receipt if a discount is applied. You can set up fiscal texts for discounts on the **Fiscal connector group** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal connector groups**).

- For manual discounts that are applied at the POS, you should set a fiscal text for the info code or info code group that is specified as the **Product discount** info code in the POS functionality profile.

    1. On the **Fiscal connector group** page, select **Text for fiscal receipt**.
    1. On the **Info codes** tab, select **Add**, and select an info code or info code group.
    1. In the **Info code number** field, select a value.
    1. In the **Subcode number** field, select a value if a subcode is required for the selected info code.
    1. In the **Text for fiscal receipt** field, specify a fiscal text that should be printed on a fiscal receipt.
    1. Set the **Print user input on fiscal receipt** option to **Yes** to override the text on a fiscal receipt with information that a user manually enters at the POS. This option applies only to info codes that have an input type of **Text**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can specify a fiscal text for several info codes to support scenarios where info code groups, linked info codes, and triggered info codes are used. In these scenarios, the fiscal receipt will contain the fiscal texts from all info codes that are linked to the transaction line where the discount was applied.

- For channel-specific discounts, you should define a fiscal text for the discount ID.

    1. On the **Fiscal connector group** page, select **Text for fiscal receipt**.
    1. On the **Discounts** tab, select **Add**, and select a discount ID.
    1. In the **Text for fiscal receipt** field, specify a fiscal text that should be printed on a fiscal receipt.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If several discounts are applied to the same transaction line, the fiscal receipt will contain fiscal texts from all discounts that are linked to those transaction line.

## Set error handling settings

The error handling options that are available in the fiscal integration are set in the fiscal registration process. For more information about error handling in the fiscal integration, see [Error handling](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#error-handling).

To set error handling settings, follow these steps.

1. On the **Fiscal registration process** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Fiscal registration processes**), you can set the following parameters for each step of the fiscal registration process:

    - **Allow skip** – This parameter enables the **Skip** option in the error handling dialog box.
    - **Allow mark as registered** – This parameter enables the **Mark as registered** option in the error handling dialog box.
    - **Allow postpone** – This parameter enables the **Postpone** option in the error handling dialog box.
    - **Continue on error** – If this parameter is enabled, the fiscal registration process can continue on the POS register if the fiscal registration of a transaction or event fails. Otherwise, to run the fiscal registration of the next transaction or event, the operator must retry the failed fiscal registration, skip it, or mark the transaction or event as registered. For more information, see [Optional fiscal registration](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#optional-fiscal-registration).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Continue on error** parameter is enabled, the **Allow skip** and **Allow mark as registered** parameters are automatically disabled.

1. The **Skip** and **Mark as registered** options in the error handling dialog box require that the **Allow skip registration or mark as registered** permission be enabled. To enable this permission, go to the **Permission groups** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Employees \> Permission groups**), and set the **Allow skip registration or mark as registered** option to **Yes**.
1. The **Postpone** option in the error handling dialog box requires that the **Allow postpone** permission be enabled. To enable the permission, go to the **Permission groups** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Employees \> Permission groups**), and set the **Allow postpone** option to **Yes**.
1. The **Skip**, **Mark as registered**, and **Postpone** options let operators enter additional information when fiscal registration fails. To make this functionality available, you should specify the **Skip**, **Mark as registered**, and **Postpone** info codes on a fiscal connector group. The information that operators enter is then saved as an info code transaction that is linked to the fiscal transaction. For more details about info codes, see [Info codes and info code groups](../info-codes-retail.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Product** trigger function isn't supported for the info codes that are used for **Skip** and **Mark as registered** in fiscal connector groups.

    - On the **Fiscal connector group** page, on the **Info codes** tab, select info codes or info code groups in the **Skip**, **Mark as registered**, and **Postpone** fields.

    > [!NOTE]
    > One fiscal document and one non-fiscal document can be generated on any step of a fiscal registration process. A fiscal document provider extension identifies every type of transaction or event as related to fiscal or non-fiscal documents. The error handling feature applies only to fiscal documents.
    >
    > - **Fiscal document** – A mandatory document that should be registered successfully (for example, a fiscal receipt).
    > - **Non-fiscal document** – A supplementary document for the transaction or event (for example, a gift card slip).

1. If the operator must be able to continue to process the current operation (for example, creation or finalization of a transaction) after a health check error occurs, you should enable the **Allow skip health check error** permission on the **Permission groups** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Employees \> Permission groups**). For more information about the health check procedure, see [Fiscal registration health check](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#fiscal-registration-health-check).

## Set up fiscal X/Z reports from the POS

To enable fiscal X/Z reports to be run from the POS, you should add new buttons to a POS layout.

- On the **Button grids** page, follow the instructions in [Add POS operations to POS layouts by using Button grid designer](../dev-itpro/add-pos-operations.md#add-a-custom-operation-button-to-the-pos-layout-in-retail-headquarters) to install the designer and update a POS layout.

    1. Select the layout to update. 
    1. Add a new button, and set the **Print fiscal X** button property.
    1. Add a new button, and set the **Print fiscal Z** button property.
    1. On the **Distribution schedule** page, run the **1090** job to transfer changes to the channel database.

## Enable manual execution of postponed fiscal registration

To enable manual execution of a postponed fiscal registration, you should add a new button to a POS layout.

- On the **Button grids** page, follow the instructions in [Add POS operations to POS layouts by using Button grid designer](../dev-itpro/add-pos-operations.md#add-a-custom-operation-button-to-the-pos-layout-in-retail-headquarters) to install the designer and update a POS layout.

    1. Select the layout to update.
    1. Add a new button, and set the **Complete fiscal registration process** button property.
