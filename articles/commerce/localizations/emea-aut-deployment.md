# Deployment guidelines for cash registers for Austria

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic is a deployment guide that shows how to enable the Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for Austria. The localization consists of several extensions of Commerce components. For example, the extensions let you print custom fields on receipts, register additional audit events, includes samples of the integration with the EFSTA System and
Electronical Fiscal Register Software. For more information about the localization for Austria, see [Fiscal registration service integration sample for Austria](./emea-aut-fi-sample.md).

Integration samples were developed based on the fiscal integration framework. For details about the fiscal integration functionality, see [Overview of fiscal integration for Retail channels](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md), these samples are part of the Retail software development kit (SDK). For information about how to install and use the SDK, see the [Retail software development kit (SDK) architecture](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-overview.md).

This localization consists of extensions for the Commerce runtime (CRT), Hardware station, and POS. To run this sample, you must modify and build the CRT, Hardware station, and POS projects. We recommend that you use an unmodified Retail SDK to make the changes that are described in this topic. We also recommend that you use a source control system, such as Azure DevOps, where no files have been changed yet.

## Development environment

Follow these steps to set up a development environment so that you can test and extend the localization functionality.

### CRT extension components

The CRT extension components are included in the CRT samples. To complete the following procedures, open the CRT solution, **CommerceRuntimeSamples.sln**, under **RetailSdk\\SampleExtensions\\CommerceRuntime**.

#### DocumentProvider.EFRSample component

1. Find the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.EFRSample** project, and build it.
2. In the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.EFRSample\\bin\\Debug** folder, find the **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.EFRSample.dll** assembly file.
3. Copy the assembly file to the CRT extensions folder:

    - **Commerce Scale Unit:** Copy the assembly to the **\\bin\\ext** folder under the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Commerce Scale Unit site location.
    - **Local CRT on Modern POS:** Copy the assembly to the **\\ext** folder under the local CRT client broker location.

4. Find the extension configuration file for CRT:

    - **Commerce Scale Unit:** The file is named **commerceruntime.ext.config**, and it's in the **bin\\ext** folder under the IIS Commerce Scale Unit site location.
    - **Local CRT on Modern POS:** The file is named **CommerceRuntime.MPOSOffline.Ext.config**, and it's under the local CRT client broker location.

5. Register the CRT change in the extension configuration file.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.EFRSample" />
    ```

#### DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR component

1. Find the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR** project, and build it.
2. In the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR\\bin\\Debug** folder, find the **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR.dll** assembly file.
