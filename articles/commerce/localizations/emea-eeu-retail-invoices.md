[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to set up information for customer invoices and return sales orders in Eastern European countries.

You can set up the following information for customer invoices and return sales orders that are generated in Retail point of sale (POS).

- You can use sales tax groups to process returns by using return sales orders. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Parameters \> Commerce parameters**. Open the **Posting \> Invoice** tab, and then set **Use sales tax group for returns** to **Yes**.

    * To specify the sales tax group for returns that are made by a customer, on the **Customers** page, on the **Commerce** FastTab, in the **Sales tax group for returns** field, select a sales tax group. When you post a return sales order for a customer, the return sales order line is updated with the sales tax group for returns that is specified in the **Customers** form.
    * To specify a sales tax group for returns that are made at a retail POS by a customer, on the **Stores** page, on the **General** FastTab, in the **Sales tax group for returns** field, select a sales tax group. When you post a return sales order for a customer of a  store, the return sales order line is updated with the sales tax group for returns that are specified on the **Stores** page.

- You can use the posting date of a customer invoice or a return sales order as the sales date of the invoice or return if the invoice or return does not have a default sales date. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Parameters \> Commerce parameters**. Open the **Posting \> Invoice** tab, and then set **Use posting date as sales date** to **Yes**.
- You can use the number range that is provided by the tax authorities to number Latvian and Lithuanian customer invoices and return sales orders.

    * Go to **Organization administration \> Number sequences \> Counters management**. There should be a record where **Module** = **Sales** and **Type** = **Invoice**.
    * Go to **Organization administration \> Number sequences \> Invoice numbering setup**. Select the **Commerce** check box for the number sequence line that is used to number the customer invoices.
