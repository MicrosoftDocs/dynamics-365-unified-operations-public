# Cash register functionality for France

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of the cash register functionality that is available for France in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. It also provides guidelines for setting up the functionality.

The cash register functionality for France consists of the following parts:

- Common point of sale (POS) features that are available to customers in all countries or regions, such as the option to register various events in the POS audit log.
- France-specific features, such as digital signatures for sales transactions.

## Certification information

This version of the cash register functionality for France has passed an audit according to the NF 525 certification requirements and is granted certificates of compliance that have the following categories and numbers: 

- **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, version 10**:

    - Certificate category: B
    - Certificate number: 0350

- **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce, version 10**:

    - Certificate category: B
    - Certificate number: 0203

Up-to-date certificates can be found on the [portal of the certification body](https://certificates.infocert.org/).

## Common POS features

To learn about POS features that are available to customers in all countries or regions, see [Commerce home page](../index.md).

The following POS localization features that are available to customers in all countries or regions can now be used specifically for France:

- **Register additional events in the POS audit event log.** If the **Audit** option in the POS functionality profile is set to **Yes**, the following events are registered in the POS audit event log:

    - Sign-in
    - Sign-out
    - Printing a copy of a receipt
    - Starting offline mode
    - Ending offline mode
    - Applying a manager override
    - Voiding a transaction 
    - Cleanup of transactions from the channel database
    - Applying a major update of the software with compliance impact

## France-specific POS features

The following France-specific POS features are enabled when the primary address of the legal entity that the store belongs to is in France.

### Digital signing overview

The following types of records (transactions and events) are digitally signed in POS:

- Sales transactions
- Copies of receipts
- Closed shifts/Z reports
- Audit events

The signature is created and recorded in the channel database at the same time that the transaction is finalized or the event is registered. The data that is signed is a text string that consists of several data fields. These fields vary, depending on the type of record. The general signing process consists of the following steps:

1. Select the next sequential number, for signing purposes, for the same register and type of record. 
1. Extract the data fields that must be signed from the record that is being signed.
1. Build a string that consists of a comma-separated list of the data fields.
1. Add the previous signature for the same register and type of record.
1. Calculate a hash code of the string.
1. Calculate an asymmetric electronic signature for the resulting string by using a digital certificate.
1. Do the base64url transformation for the resulting string.
1. Store the string that is used for signing, the sequential number, the signature, the hash algorithm identification, and the thumbprint of the certificate in a fiscal response record that is linked to the transaction or event.
1. Transfer the fiscal response to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in Commerce headquarters, together with the transaction or event.

> [!NOTE]
> The following hash functions aren't acceptable: CRC16, CRC32, SHA-1, and MD5. Commerce supports only the SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 hash functions. If you want to use a different hash function, you must implement a customization.
>
> You can use either a digital certificate that is issued by an accredited body or a self-signed certificate for digital signing. Only certificates that have RSA-2048-bit or Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) 224-bit minimum private keys are acceptable. Commerce supports only RSA-2048-bit or longer keys. If you want to use an ECDSA key, you must implement a customization.

### Digital signing of sales transactions

Only transactions for cash sales are signed. Here are some examples of transactions that are excluded from the signing process:

- Prepayments (customer account deposits)
- Quotations
- Prepayments for sales orders (customer order deposits)
- Issuing a gift card and adding funds to a gift card
- Non-sales transactions (float entry, tender removal, and so on)

The data that is signed for a sales transaction is a text string that consists of the following data fields:

- The total amount of sales, including tax per tax rate.
- The total amount of sales, including tax.
- The date and time of the transaction, in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.
- The register number.
- The sequential number of the signed sales transaction for the register.
- The type of sales transaction.
- A value (Y/N) that indicates whether the transaction is the first signed sales transaction for the register.
- The previous signature for the same register. A blank value is used for the first signed sales transaction.

You can view the transaction signature and the transaction data that was used to generate it on the **Fiscal transactions** FastTab of the **Store transactions** page in Commerce headquarters. By selecting **Extended data**, you can view specific properties of the fiscal transaction, such as the signature, sequential number, certificate thumbprint, and hash algorithm identification. 

### Digital signing of receipt copies

When a copy of a receipt is printed, the event is registered in the POS audit event log. Only copies of receipts for signed sales transactions are signed. The data that is signed for a receipt copy event is a text string that consists of the following data fields:

- The register number that the copy of the receipt is printed from.
- The sequential number of the signed receipt copy event for the register.
- The type of transaction for the original sales transaction.
- The number of the receipt copy for the sales transaction.
- The staff ID of the operator who prints the receipt copy.
- The date and time of the receipt copy event, in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.
- The register number of the original sales transaction.
- The sequential number of the original sales transaction for the register.
- A value (Y/N) that indicates whether the transaction is the first signed receipt copy event for the register.
- The previous signature for the same register. A blank value is used for the first signed receipt copy event.

You can view the signature of the receipt copy, together with the event data that was used to generate it, on the **Fiscal registration results** tab of the **Audit events** page in Commerce headquarters.

### Digital signing of closed shifts

When a shift is closed, the event is registered in the POS audit event log. The data that is signed for a shift closing event is a text string that consists of the following data fields:

- The total amount of sales and returns for the shift, including tax per tax rate.
- The total amount of sales and returns for the shift, including tax.
- The cumulative perpetual grand total of absolute values of sales and returns for shifts of the same register, including tax. 
- The date and time of the shift closing event, in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.
- The date and time of the shift.
- The sequential number of the shift closing event for the register.
- A value (Y/N) that indicates whether the transaction is the first signed shift closing event for the register.
- The previous signature for the same register. A blank value is used for the first signed shift closing event.

> [!NOTE]
> Because of the requirement to maintain a chain of closed shifts for the same register, closing a shift on a register that is different from the one that the shift was opened on is not supported. It may be added in later updates.

You can view the signature of a closed shift, together with the shift data that was used to generate it, on the **Fiscal registration results** tab of the **Shifts** page in Commerce headquarters.

### Digital signing of events

The data that is signed for an event other than a receipt copy or shift closing event is a text string that consists of the following data fields:

- The sequential number of the signed event for the register.
- A predefined event code.
- A description of the event.
- The date and time of the event.
- The staff ID of the operator who raised the event.
- The register number.
- A value (Y/N) that indicates whether the transaction is the first signed event for the register.
- The previous signature for the same register. A blank value is used for the first signed event.

You can view the event signature, together with the event data that was used to generate it, on the **Fiscal registration results** tab of the **Audit events** page in Commerce headquarters.

### Receipts

Receipts for France can include additional information that was implemented by using custom fields:

- **Transaction type** â€“ You can add a field to a receipt format layout to identify the type of transaction. For example, a sales receipt will include the text "Sales."
- **Sequential number of signed sales transaction** â€“ A receipt can include the sequential number of a signed sales transaction. This number is used to associate the printed receipt with a digital signature in the database.
- **Extract from digital signature** â€“ A receipt can include an extract from the digital signature. This extract is used to confirm that the transaction is signed. It consists of a concatenation of the third, seventh, thirteenth, and nineteenth symbols of the signature.
- **Reprint number** â€“ An original receipt or a receipt copy can include the number of the receipt copy. For an original receipt, the value is **0** (zero).
- **Line count** â€“ A receipt can include the number of printed item lines on the receipt.
- **Sales totals** â€“ Custom fields for receipt totals exclude non-sales amounts from the total transaction amounts. Non-sales amounts include amounts for the following operations:

    - Prepayments (customer account deposits)
    - Prepayments for sales orders (customer order deposits)
    - Issuing a gift card
    - Adding funds to a gift card

- **Certification data** â€“ A receipt can include the category and number of a certificate of compliance that an authorized body issued per the NF 525 certification requirements.
- **Software version** â€“ A receipt can include the version of the software that was certified per the NF 525 certification requirements and that is used to produce receipts.

### Restricting the duration of shifts

There is an option to enforce daily shift closing in POS. A shift can't last longer than the time that is specified in the **Shift closing time** field. Several minutes before that time, the operator will start to receive warnings that the shift must be closed. The number of minutes is determined by the value of the **Shift closing interval (minutes)** field.

### X and Z reports

The information that is included on X and Z reports is based on French requirements:

- **Total sales** for the shift. This information includes amounts only for cash sales transactions. Prepayments and operations for issuing a gift card are excluded.
- **Total returns** for the shift.
- **Cumulative perpetual grand total**. This amount is calculated as the cumulative grand total amount of the previous shift, plus the total sales amount of this shift, minus the absolute value of the total return amount of this shift.
- **Cumulative perpetual grand total (absolute value)**. This amount is calculated as the cumulative perpetual grand total amount of the previous shift, plus the total sales amount of this shift, plus the absolute value of the total return amount of this shift.
- Value-added tax (VAT) amounts per tax rate.

The totals are also stored in the closed shift record and transferred to Commerce headquarters.

### Period grand total journal

Period grand total journals summarize sales totals per store and fiscal period (for example, per month). In addition, an annual journal summarizes sales totals per store and fiscal year.

Period grand total journals are maintained on the **Period grand total journal** page. To create a new journal, you must specify a store. If previous journals exist for the store, the next fiscal period after the last closed journal for the store is automatically used as the new journal period. If previous journals do not exist, you can specify the end date of the journal. In this case, the fiscal period that includes the specified date is used as the journal period.

The journal can then be calculated. Shifts that were closed during the journal period are selected, and totals are calculated for those shifts. You can view the journal's tax totals per sales tax code. You can also view the shifts that are included in the journal.

After the journal is calculated, it can be closed. A closed journal can't be modified, and another journal can't be created for a previous fiscal period, the same period, or an intersecting period. However, the last closed journal for a store can be canceled. In that case, another journal can be created for the same store and fiscal period.

A closed journal is digitally signed. The data that is signed for a closed journal is a text string that consists of the following data fields:

- The total amounts of sales and returns for the store and period, including tax per tax rate.
- The total amount of sales and returns for the store and period, including tax.
- The cumulative perpetual grand total of absolute values of sales and returns for the store and period, including tax. 
- The date and time of closing the journal, in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.
- The start and end dates of the period.
- The sequential number of the signed period grand total journal for the store.
- A value (Y/N) that indicates whether the journal is the first signed journal for the store.
- The previous signature for the store and period. A blank value is used for the first signed journal for the store.

You can view the journal signature, together with the journal data that was used to generate it, on the **Signature details** tab of the **Period grand total journal** page in Commerce headquarters.

A period grand total journal can also be marked as **Annual** when it's created. An annual journal summarizes period grand total journals for the fiscal periods of a fiscal year. An annual journal can be created for a fiscal year only if a journal for the last fiscal period of the fiscal year has been created, calculated, and closed. However, journals don't have to exist for *all* fiscal periods of the fiscal year. For example, if a new store is opened in the middle of the year, the first journal will correspond to the fiscal period that the store is opened during. In this case, the first annual journal will summarize journals for fiscal periods from the fiscal period that the store is opened during to the last fiscal period of the fiscal year.

### Fiscal archive

A fiscal archive is an XML file that can be exported from a period grand total journal that has been closed. It includes the totals for the closed period. It also includes detailed data about sales transactions and events. The exported file is digitally signed, and the signature is contained in a separate file. Exported fiscal archives must be kept on secured external media for the legal retention period.

Commerce also includes a tool that can be used to verify the integrity of a fiscal archive, and to detect violations of the signature of the archive and of the chains of signed records in the archive. This tool takes the form of a Windows PowerShell script that is available via the Commerce software development kit (SDK). For detailed information about the structure of the fiscal archive format and guidance about how to use the Fiscal archive integrity verification tool, see [Fiscal archive for France](./emea-fra-fiscal-archive.md).

## Set up Commerce for France

This section describes the Commerce settings that are specific to and recommended for France. For more information, see [Commerce home page](../index.md).

To use the France-specific functionality, you must complete these tasks:

- Set the **Country/region** field to **FRA** (France) in the primary address of the legal entity.
- Set the **ISO code** field to **FR** (France) in the POS functionality profile of every store that is located in France.

You must also specify the following settings for France. Note that you must run appropriate distribution jobs after you complete the setup.

### Set up the legal entity

You must make the following changes on the **Legal entities** page. These settings are used in the archive format.

- On the **Bank account information** FastTab, in the **Routing number** field, specify the VAT identifier of the organization.
- On the **Statutory reporting** FastTab, in the **NAF code** field, specify the Nomenclature des ActivitÃ©s FranÃ§aises (NAF) code of the organization.
- On the **Tax registration** FastTab, in the **Tax registration number** field, specify the SystÃ¨me d'identification du rÃ©pertoire des Ã©tablissements (SIRET) number of the organization.

### Set up VAT per French requirements

You must create sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups. You must also set up sales tax information for products and services. For more information about how to set up and use sales tax, see [Sales tax overview](../../financials/general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.md).

You must also specify sales tax groups and enable the **Prices include sales tax** option for stores that are located in France.

### Set up functionality profiles

You must enable auditing by setting the **Audit** option to **Yes**.

To enforce daily shift closing, you must make the following changes:

- Set the **Enforce daily shift closing** option to **Yes**.
- Set the **Shift closing time** and **Shift closing interval (minutes)** fields.

### Configure custom fields so that they can be used in receipt formats for sales receipts

You can configure the language text and custom fields that are used in the POS receipt formats. The default company of the user who creates the receipt setup should be the same legal entity where the language text setup is created. Alternatively, the same language texts should be created in both the user's default company and the legal entity of the store that the setup is created for.

On the **Language text** page, add the following records for the labels of the custom fields for receipt layouts. Note that the **Language ID**, **Text ID**, and **Text** values that are shown in the table are just examples. You can change them to meet to your requirements. However, the **Text ID** values that you use must be unique, and they must be equal to or higher than 900001.

| Language ID | Text ID | Text ID                   |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------|
| en-US       | 900001  | Transaction type          |

| LINECOUNT_FR                    | Receipt | 900011          |

### Configure receipt formats

For every required receipt format, change the value of the **Print behavior** field to **Always print**.

In the Receipt format designer, add the following custom fields to the appropriate receipt sections. Note that field names correspond to the language texts that you defined in the previous section.

- **Header:** Add the following field:

    - **Transaction type** â€“ This field identifies the type of receipt.

- **Lines:** We recommend that you add the following standard fields:

    - **Unit price with tax**
    - **Total price with tax**
    - **Tax ID**

- **Footer:** Add the following fields:

    - **Sales total** â€“ This field prints the receipt's total cash sale amount. The amount excludes tax. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded.
    - **Sales total tax** â€“ This field prints the receipt's total tax amount for cash sales. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded. 
    - **Sales total including tax** â€“ This field prints the receipt's total cash sale amount. The amount includes tax. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded.
    - **Tax ID** â€“ This standard field enables a sales tax summary to be printed per sales tax code. The field must be added to a new line.
    - **Sales tax basis** â€“ This field prints the receipt's tax basis for cash sales per sales tax code. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded. The field must be added to the same line as the **Tax ID** field.
    - **Sales tax amount** â€“ This field prints the receipt's tax amount for cash sales per sales tax code. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded. The field must be added to the same line as the **Tax ID** field.

        > [!NOTE]
        > By default, the certificate category and number that are assigned to [Finance](#certification-information) are printed. If you're implementing Commerce, you must override the certificate category and number.

    - **Text** â€“ Add a text field, and specify the version of the software that was certified per the NF 525 certification requirements and that is used to produce receipts (for example, **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance v.10** or **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce v.10**).

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you customize the POS application, and your customizations affect the compliance of the application, you might have to request a new certificate of compliance from an accredited body. In this case, you must override the certificate category and number, and specify a corresponding software version number. Otherwise, the default values for the certificate category and number will be printed.

    - **Line count** â€“ This field prints the number of printed item lines on a receipt.
    - **Text** â€“ Add a text field, and specify the VAT identifier of the organization.
    - **Text** â€“ Add a text field, and specify the NAF code of the organization.

### Configure the digital signature parameters

You must configure certificates that will be used for digital signing of records on the Commerce channel side (sales transactions and audit events) and on the Commerce headquarters side (period grand total journals and fiscal archives). The signing is done by using a digital certificate that is stored in Azure Key Vault. For the offline mode of Modern POS, the signing can also be done by using a digital certificate that is stored in the local storage of the machine that Modern POS is installed on. The [User-defined certificate profiles for retail stores](./certificate-profiles-for-retail-stores.md) feature enables configuration of certificates that are stored in Key Vault. It also supports failover to offline mode when Key Vault or Commerce headquarters isn't available. This feature extends the [Manage secrets for retail channels](../dev-itpro/manage-secrets.md) feature.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use either a digital certificate that is issued by an accredited body or a self-signed certificate for digital signing. Only certificates that have RSA-2048-bit or Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) 224-bit minimum private keys are acceptable. Commerce supports only RSA-2048-bit or longer keys. If you want to use an ECDSA key, you must implement a customization.

The following steps must be completed before you can use a digital certificate that is stored in Key Vault storage:

1. The Key Vault storage must be created. We recommend that you deploy the storage in the same geographical region as the Commerce Scale Unit.
1. The certificate must be uploaded to the Key Vault storage.
1. The Application Object Server (AOS) application must be authorized to read secrets from the Key Vault storage.

For more information about how to work with Key Vault, see [Get started with Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started).

Next, on the **Key Vault parameters** page, you must specify the parameters for accessing the Key Vault storage:

- **Name** and **Description** â€“ The name and description of the Key Vault storage.
- **Key Vault URL** â€“ The URL of the Key Vault storage.
- **Key Vault client** â€“ An interactive client ID of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application that is associated with the Key Vault storage for authentication purposes. This client should have access to read secrets from the storage.
- **Key Vault secret key** â€“ A secret key that is associated with the Azure AD application that is used for authentication in the Key Vault storage.
- **Name**, **Description**, and **Secret reference** â€“ The name, description, and secret reference of the certificate.

Next, you must configure a certificate profile for your certificates that are stored in Key Vault or local certificate storage. The certificate profile is used for signing on the channel side.

To configure a certificate profile for your certificates in Commerce headquarters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **System administration \> Setup \> Certificate profiles**. 
1. Create a new certificate profile.
1. On the **Legal entities** FastTab, add the required legal entities.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Add a new certificate. Both certificates that are stored in Key Vault and local certificates are supported. You can add as many certificates as you require and set priorities for the certificates. If a certificate that has a higher priority isn't available, the next certificate will be used, based on priority.

    - For a certificate that is stored in Key Vault, you must select the certificate in the drop-down list.
    - For a certificate that is stored locally, you must specify the thumbprint of the certificate.

1. Go to **Retail and Commerce \> Channel setup \> Fiscal integration \> Connector technical profiles**.
1. On the **Settings** FastTab, specify the following parameters for digital signatures:

    - **Certificate profile** â€“ Select the certificate profile that you configured earlier.
    - **Hash algorithm** â€“ Specify one of the cryptographic hash algorithms that are supported by Microsoft .NET, such as **SHA256**.
    - **Activate health check** â€“ For more information about the health check feature, see [Fiscal registration health check](./fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#fiscal-registration-health-check).

Finally, on the **Commerce parameters** page (**Retail and Commerce \> Headquarters setup \> Parameters \> Commerce parameters**), you must specify the following parameters for digital signing on the Commerce headquarters side:

- **Certificate** â€“ Select a certificate that is stored in Key Vault.
- **Hash function** â€“ Specify one of the cryptographic hash algorithms that are supported by Microsoft .NET, such as **SHA256**.
- **Encoding** â€“ Specify the encoding of the signed data, such as **UTF-8**.

> [!NOTE]
> The following hash functions aren't acceptable: CRC16, CRC32, SHA-1, and MD5. Commerce supports only the SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 hash functions. If you want to use a different hash function, you must implement a customization.

### Configure the archive export format

You can download the ER configuration for the archive from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information, see [Import electronic reporting configurations](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-import-ger-configurations.md). You must download the following versions, or later versions, of the configurations:

- **Retail channel data.version.2** data model
- **Archiving DMM.version.2.3** data model mapping
- **Retail data archive FR .version.2.5** format

After you import the configurations, in the **Retail data archive export format** field on the **Electronic documents** tab of the **Commerce parameters** page, select the **Retail data archive FR .version.2.5** format or the format that you downloaded earlier.

### Reinitialize Commerce components

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to complete the steps of this section if you are updating an existing environment.

To enable audit events, you must reinitialize the Commerce extensible enumerations. To enable France-specific data to be transmitted from POS to Commerce headquarters, you must reinitialize the Commerce scheduler.

1. On the **Commerce parameters** page, on the **General** FastTab, select **Initialize**. For more information, see [Initialize seed data in new Retail environments](../enable-configure-retail-functionality.md).
1. There is an option to separately configure the scheduler. Go to **Commerce scheduler** \> **Initialize Commerce scheduler**. In the **Initialize Commerce scheduler** dialog box, select **OK**.

### Configure channel components

To enable France-specific functionality, you must configure extensions for channel components. For more information, see the [deployment guidelines](./emea-fra-fi-deployment.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the Commerce functionality for France is based on the [fiscal integration framework](./fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md). For information about the legacy digital signing sample for France, see [Deployment guidelines for cash registers for France (legacy)](./emea-fra-deployment.md).  For guidelines about how to enable the fiscal integration functionality for France in existing environments that use the legacy digital signing sample, see [Migrate from legacy Commerce functionality for France](./emea-fra-fi-migration.md).
