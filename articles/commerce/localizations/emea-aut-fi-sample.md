# Fiscal registration service integration sample for Austria

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include[banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of the fiscal integration sample for Austria in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

To meet local fiscal requirements for cash registers in Austria, the Dynamics 365 Retail functionality for Austria includes a sample integration of the point of sale (POS) with an external fiscal registration service. The sample extends the [fiscal integration functionality](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md). It's based on the [EFR (Electronic Fiscal Register)](https://www.efsta.eu/at/fiskalloesungen/oesterreich) solution from [EFSTA](https://www.efsta.eu/at/) and enables communication with the EFR service via the HTTPS protocol. The EFR service should be hosted on either the Retail Hardware station or a separate machine that can be connected to from the Hardware station. The sample is provided in the form of source code and is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK).

Microsoft doesn't release any hardware, software, or documentation from EFSTA. For information about how to get the EFR solution and operate it, contact [EFSTA](https://www.efsta.eu/at/kontakt).

## Scenarios

The following scenarios are covered by the fiscal registration service integration sample for Austria:

- Registration of cash transactions in the fiscal registration service:

    - Send detailed transaction data to the fiscal registration service. This data includes sales line information, and information about discounts, payments, and taxes.
    - Capture a response from the fiscal registration service. This response includes a digital signature and a link to the registered transaction.
    - Register taxes, and map them to the fiscal registration service's tax codes.
    - Print the QR code for a registered transaction on the receipt.

- Registration of gift card operations and customer deposits as non-cash transactions in the fiscal registration service:

    - Issue or add money to a gift card.
    - Register a customer account deposit.
    - Register a customer order deposit.

- Registration of non-sales transactions and events as non-cash transactions in the fiscal registration service:

    - Open shift and Close shift
    - Start amount, Float entry, and Tender removal
    - Price override
    - Tax override
    - Print copy of receipt
    - Open drawer
    - Print X report
    - Print Z report

- Printing end-of-day statements (X/Z reports) that have Austria-specific fields:

    - Total number of products or services that were delivered to customers
    - Breakdown of sales by tax rate
    - Breakdown of payments by cashier/cash register operator
    - Price discounts and returns that reduce daily sales
    - Zero sales (giveaways)

- Error handling, such as the following options:

    - Retry fiscal registration if a retry is possible, such as if the fiscal registration service isn't available, isn't ready, or isn't responding.
    - Postpone fiscal registration.
    - Skip fiscal registration, or mark the transaction as registered, and include info codes to capture the reason for the failure and additional information.
    - Check the availability of the fiscal registration service before a new sales transaction is opened or a sales transaction is finalized.

### Gift cards

The fiscal registration service integration sample implements the following rules that are related to gift cards:

- Exclude sales lines that are related to the *Issue gift card* and *Add to gift card* operations from a cash transaction. Instead of registering those lines as a part of a cash transaction, register them as a separate non-cash transaction in the fiscal registration service.
- Don't print a tax group breakdown and a QR code on a receipt if the receipt consists only of gift card lines.
- Print the total amount of gift cards that are issued or re-charged in a transaction separately from the cash transaction amount on the receipt.
- Save calculated adjustments of payment lines in the channel database with a reference to a corresponding fiscal transaction.
- Payment by gift card is considered a regular payment.

### Customer deposits and customer order deposits

The fiscal registration service integration sample implements the following rules that are related to customer deposits and customer order deposits:

- Register a non-cash transaction if a transaction is a customer deposit.
- Register a non-cash transaction if a transaction contains only a customer order deposit or a customer order deposit refund.
- Deduct the customer order deposit amount from payment lines when a hybrid customer order is created.
- Save calculated adjustments of payment lines in the channel database with a reference to a fiscal transaction for a hybrid customer order.

### Limitations of the sample

The fiscal registration service supports only scenarios where sales tax is included in the price. Therefore, the **Price include sales tax** option must be set to **Yes** for both stores and customers.

## Set up Commerce for Austria

This section describes the Commerce settings that are specific to and recommended for Austria. For more information setup information, see [Commerce home page](../index.md).

To use the Austria-specific functionality, you must specify the following settings:

- In the primary address of the legal entity, set the **Country/region** field to **AUT** (Austria).
- In the POS functionality profile of every store that is located in Austria, set the **ISO code** field to **AT** (Austria).

You must also specify the following settings for Austria. Note that you must run appropriate distribution jobs after you complete the setup.

### Set up VAT per Austrian requirements

You must create sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups. You must also set up sales tax information for products and services. For more information about how to set up and use sales tax features, see [Sales tax overview](../../finance/general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.md).

On sales receipts, you can print an abbreviated code for a sales tax code (for example, "A" or "B"). To make this functionality available, set the **Print code** field on the **Sales tax codes** page.

### Set up stores

On the **All stores** page, update the store details. Specifically, set the following parameters:

- In the **Sales tax group** field, specify the sales tax group that should be used for sales to the default customer.
- Set the **Prices include sales tax** option to **Yes**.
- Set the **Name** field to the company name. This change helps guarantee that the company name appears on a sales receipt. Alternatively, you can add the company name to the sales receipt layout as free-form text.
- Set the **Tax identification number (TIN)** field to the company identification number. This change helps guarantee that the company identification number appears on a sales receipt. Alternatively, you can add the company identification number to the sales receipt layout as free-form text.

### Set up functionality profiles

Set up POS functionality profiles:

- On the **Receipt numbering** FastTab, set up receipt numbering by creating or updating records for the **Sale**, **Sales order**, and **Return** receipt transaction types.

### Configure custom fields so that they can be used in receipt formats for sales receipts

You can configure the language text and custom fields that are used in the POS receipt formats. The default company of the user who creates the receipt setup should be the same legal entity where the language text setup is created. Alternatively, the same language texts should be created in both the user's default company and the legal entity of the store that the setup is created for.

On the **Language text** page, add the following records for the labels of the custom fields for receipt layouts. Note that the **Language ID**, **Text ID**, and **Text** values that are shown in the table are just examples. You can change them to meet to your requirements. However, the **Text ID** values that you use must be unique, and they must be equal to or more than 900001.

Add the following POS labels to the **POS** section of **Language text** from the table:

| Language ID | Text ID | Text                      |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------|
| en-US       | 900001  | QR Code                   |
| en-US       | 900002  | Continuous Number         |
| en-US       | 900003  | Tax Retail Print Code     |
| en-US       | 900004  | Total (sales)             |
| en-US       | 900005  | Total Tax (sales)         |
| en-US       | 900006  | Total Include Tax (sales) |
| en-US       | 900007  | Tax Amount (sales)        |
| en-US       | 900008  | Tax Basis (sales)         |

On the **Custom fields** page, add the following records for the custom fields for receipt layouts. Note that **Caption text ID** values must correspond to the **Text ID** values that you specified on the **Language text** page:

| Name                 | Type    | Caption text ID |
|----------------------|---------|-----------------|
| QRCODE               | Receipt | 900001          |
| CONTINUOUSNUMBER     | Receipt | 900002          |
| RETAILPRINTCODE      | Receipt | 900003          |
| SALESTOTAL           | Receipt | 900004          |
| SALESTOTALTAX        | Receipt | 900005          |
| SALESTOTALINCLUDETAX | Receipt | 900006          |
| SALESTAXAMOUNT       | Receipt | 900007          |
| SALESTAXBASIS        | Receipt | 900008          |

> [!NOTE]
> It's important that you specify correct custom field names, as listed in the preceding table. An incorrect custom field name will cause missing data in receipts.

### Configure receipt formats

For every required receipt format, change the value of the **Print behavior** field to **Always print**.

In the Receipt format designer, add the following custom fields to the appropriate receipt sections. Note that field names correspond to the language texts that you defined in the previous section.

- **Header:** Add the following fields:

    - **Store name** and **Tax Identification Number** fields, which are used to print the company name and identity number on receipts. Alternatively, you can add the company name and identity number to the layout as free-form text.
    - **Store address**, **Date**, **Time 24H**, **Receipt Number**, and **Register number** fields.
    - **Continuous Number** fields, to identify the number of the cash transaction in the fiscal registration service.

- **Lines:** Add the following fields:

    - **Item name**.
    - **Qty**.
    - **Total price with tax**.
    - **Tax Retail Print Code**, which is used to print the abbreviated code that corresponds to the sales tax code that applies to the item.

- **Footer:** Add the following fields:

    - Payment fields, so that the payment amounts for each payment method are printed. For example, add the **Tender name** and **Tender amount** fields to one line of the layout.
    - **Sales total** field group:

        - **Total (sales)** field, which is used to print the receipt's total cash sale amount. The amount excludes tax. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded.
        - **Total Include Tax (sales)** field, which is used to print the receipt's total cash sale amount. The amount includes tax. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded.
        - **Total Tax (sales)** field, which is used to print the receipt's total tax amount for cash sales. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded.

    - **Tax break down** field group. All the fields in this field group must be printed on one separate line.

        - **Tax Id** field, which is a standard field that enables a sales tax summary to be printed for each sales tax code. The field must be added to a new line.
        - **Tax Percentage** field, which is a standard field that is used to print the effective tax rate for the sales tax code.
        - **Tax Basis (sales)** field, which is used to print the receipt's total cash sale amount for the sales tax code. Prepayments and gift card operations are excluded.
        - **Tax Amount (sales)** field, which is used to print the receipt's tax amount for cash sales for the sales tax code.
        - **Tax Retail Print Code** field, which is used to print the abbreviated code that corresponds to the sales tax code.

    - **QR Code** field, which is used to print the reference to the registered cash transaction in the form of QR code.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **QR Code** value is retrieved from the fiscal register response. EFR returns a QR code in its response only if the value of the **Attributes** field in the EFR configuration is described in the EFSTA documentation. The QR code format in the **Attributes** field in the EFR configuration must be set to **BMP**.

For more information about how to work with receipt formats, see [Set up and design receipt formats](../receipt-templates-printing.md).

## Set up fiscal integration for Austria

The fiscal registration service integration sample for Austria is based on the [fiscal integration functionality](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md) and is part of the Retail SDK. The sample is located in the **src\\FiscalIntegration\\Efr** folder of the [Dynamics 365 Commerce Solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/) repository (for example, [the sample in release/9.33](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/tree/release/9.33/src/FiscalIntegration/Efr)). The sample [consists](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#fiscal-registration-process-and-fiscal-integration-samples-for-fiscal-devices-and-services) of a fiscal document provider, which is an extension of the Commerce runtime (CRT), and a fiscal connector, which is an extension of Commerce Hardware Station. For more information about how to use the Retail SDK, see [Retail SDK architecture](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-overview.md) and [Set up a build pipeline for the independent-packaging SDK](../dev-itpro/build-pipeline.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Because of limitations of the [new independent packaging and extension model](../dev-itpro/build-pipeline.md), it can't currently be used for this fiscal integration sample. You must use the previous version of the Retail SDK on a developer virtual machine (VM) in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information, see [Deployment guidelines for the fiscal integration sample for Austria (legacy)](emea-aut-fi-sample-sdk.md). Support for the new independent packaging and extension model for fiscal integration samples is planned for later versions.

#### Default data mapping

The following default data mapping is included in the fiscal document provider configuration that is provided as part of the fiscal integration sample:

- **Value-added tax (VAT) rates mapping** – The mapping of tax percentage values that are set up for the sales tax codes to values of the **TaxG** (tax group) attribute in requests that are sent to the fiscal service. Here is the default mapping:

    ```
    A: 20.00; B: 10.00; C: 13.00; D: 0.00; E: 19.00; F: 7.00
    ```

    The first component in each pair represents a VAT tax group that is supported by the EFR fiscal registration service. The second component represents the corresponding VAT rate. For more information about VAT tax groups that EFR supports for Austria, see the [EFR reference](https://public.efsta.net/efr/).

#### Fiscal connector settings

The following settings are included in the fiscal connector configuration that is provided as part of the fiscal integration sample:

- **Endpoint address** – The URL of the fiscal registration service.
- **Device timeout** – The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the fiscal connector will wait for a response from the fiscal registration service.
- **Show fiscal registration notifications** – This flag controls whether notifications that the fiscal registration service returns should be shown to the operator.

### Configure channel components

> [!WARNING]
> Because of limitations of the [new independent packaging and extension model](../dev-itpro/build-pipeline.md), it can't currently be used for this fiscal integration sample. You must use the previous version of the Retail SDK on a developer VM in LCS. For more information, see [Deployment guidelines for the fiscal integration sample for Austria (legacy)](emea-aut-fi-sample-sdk.md).

## Design of extensions

The fiscal registration service integration sample for Austria is based on the [fiscal integration functionality](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md) and is part of the Retail SDK. The sample is located in the **src\\FiscalIntegration\\Efr** folder of the [Dynamics 365 Commerce Solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/) repository (for example, [the sample in release/9.33](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/tree/release/9.33/src/FiscalIntegration/Efr)). The sample [consists](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md#fiscal-registration-process-and-fiscal-integration-samples-for-fiscal-devices-and-services) of a fiscal document provider, which is an extension of CRT, and a fiscal connector, which is an extension of Commerce Hardware Station. For more information about how to use the Retail SDK, see [Retail SDK architecture](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-overview.md) and [Set up a build pipeline for the independent-packaging SDK](../dev-itpro/build-pipeline.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Because of limitations of the [new independent packaging and extension model](../dev-itpro/build-pipeline.md), it can't currently be used for this fiscal integration sample. You must use the previous version of the Retail SDK on a developer VM in LCS. For more information, see [Deployment guidelines for the fiscal integration sample for Austria (legacy)](emea-aut-fi-sample-sdk.md). Support for the new independent packaging and extension model for fiscal integration samples is planned for later versions.

### Commerce runtime extension design 

The purpose of the extension that is a fiscal document provider is to generate service-specific documents and handle responses from the fiscal registration service.

#### Request handler

There are two request handlers for document providers:

- **DocumentProviderEFRFiscalAUT** – This handler is used to generate fiscal documents for the fiscal registration service.
- **DocumentProviderEFRNonFiscalAUT** – This handler is used to generate non-fiscal documents for the fiscal registration service.

These handlers are inherited from the **INamedRequestHandler** interface. The **HandlerName** method is responsible for returning the name of the handler. The handler name should match the connector document provider name that is specified in Commerce headquarters.

The connector supports the following requests:

- **GetFiscalDocumentDocumentProviderRequest** – This request contains information about what document should be generated. It returns a service-specific document that should be registered in the fiscal registration service.
- **GetNonFiscalDocumentDocumentProviderRequest** – This request contains information about what non-fiscal document should be generated. It returns a service-specific document that should be registered in the fiscal registration service.
- **GetSupportedRegistrableEventsDocumentProviderRequest** – This request returns the list of events to subscribe to. Currently, the following events are supported: sales, printing X report, printing Z report, customer account deposits, customer order deposits, audit events, and non-sales transactions.
- **GetFiscalRegisterResponseToSaveDocumentProviderRequest** – This request returns the response from the fiscal registration service. This response is serialized to form a string so that it's ready to be saved.

#### Configuration

The configuration files for the fiscal document provider are located in the **src\\FiscalIntegration\\Efr\\Configurations\\DocumentProviders** folder of the [Dynamics 365 Commerce Solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/) repository:

- **DocumentProviderFiscalEFRSampleAustria** – The configuration file for the fiscal document provider for fiscal documents.
- **DocumentProviderNonFiscalEFRSampleAustria** – The configuration file for the fiscal document provider for non-fiscal documents.

The purpose of these files is to enable settings of the fiscal document provider to be configured from Commerce headquarters. The file format is aligned with the requirements for fiscal integration configuration.

### Hardware station extension design

The purpose of the fiscal connector extension is to communicate with the fiscal registration service. The Hardware station extension uses the HTTP and HTTPS protocols to submit documents that the CRT extension generates to the fiscal registration service. It also handles the responses that are received from the fiscal registration service.

#### Request handler

The **EFRHandler** request handler is the entry point for handling requests to the fiscal registration service.

The handler is inherited from the **INamedRequestHandler** interface. The **HandlerName** method is responsible for returning the name of the handler. The handler name should match the fiscal connector name that is specified in Commerce headquarters.

The fiscal connector supports the following requests:

- **SubmitDocumentFiscalDeviceRequest** – This request sends documents to the fiscal registration service and returns a response from it.
- **IsReadyFiscalDeviceRequest** – This request is used for a health check of the fiscal registration service.
- **InitializeFiscalDeviceRequest** – This request is used to initialize the fiscal registration service.

#### Configuration

The configuration file for the fiscal connector is located at **src\\FiscalIntegration\\Efr\\Configurations\\Connectors\\ConnectorEFRSample.xml** in the [Dynamics 365 Commerce Solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/) repository. The purpose of the file is to enable settings of the fiscal connector to be configured from Commerce headquarters. The file format is aligned with the requirements for fiscal integration configuration.

### POS fiscal connector extension design

The purpose of the POS fiscal connector extension is to communicate with the fiscal registration service from POS. It uses the HTTPS protocol for communication.

#### Fiscal connector factory

The fiscal connector factory maps the connector name to the fiscal connector implementation and is located in the **Pos.Extension\\Connectors\\FiscalConnectorFactory.ts** file. The connector name should match the fiscal connector name that is specified in Commerce headquarters.

#### EFR fiscal connector

The EFR fiscal connector is located in the **Pos.Extension\\Connectors\\Efr\\EfrFiscalConnector.ts** file. It implements the **IFiscalConnector** interface that supports the following requests:

- **FiscalRegisterSubmitDocumentClientRequest** – This request sends documents to the fiscal registration service and returns a response from it.
- **FiscalRegisterIsReadyClientRequest** – This request is used for a health check of the fiscal registration service.
- **FiscalRegisterInitializeClientRequest** – This request is used to initialize the fiscal registration service.

#### Configuration

The configuration file is located in the **src\\FiscalIntegration\\Efr\\Configurations\\Connectors** folder of the [Dynamics 365 Commerce Solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/) repository. The purpose of the file is to enable settings for the fiscal connector to be configured from Commerce headquarters. The file format is aligned with the requirements for fiscal integration configuration. The following settings are added:

- **Endpoint address** – The URL of the fiscal registration service.
- **Timeout** – The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the connector will wait for a response from the fiscal registration service.
