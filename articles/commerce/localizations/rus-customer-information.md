# Customer information management for Russia

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes scenarios for handling customer information in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce point of sale (POS) for Russia.

Dynamics 365 Commerce lets you specify customer information such as a phone number or email address when you create or edit a customer master record in POS. You can also specify customer information for a sales transaction either by copying the information from the customer that is identified in the transaction or by manually entering it. Customer information can then be included on the fiscal receipt. For information about how to generate and print fiscal receipts, see [Fiscal printer integration sample for Russia](rus-fpi-sample.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Customer information is included on the fiscal receipt that is sent to the fiscal printer. However, it isn't printed on the sample fiscal receipt. To print customer information on the fiscal receipt, you must customize the sample fiscal receipt.

## Example scenarios

The following example scenarios show how to work with customer information in Commerce POS for Russia.

### Scenario 1: Make a sale to an anonymous customer

1. Sign in to POS.
1. Add items to the cart.
1. Select **Add customer information**, and then select **Enter manually**.
1. Select whether a phone number or an email address will be specified.
1. Enter the customer information, and then select **OK**.
1. Register payments for the transaction, and then finalize the transaction. The fiscal receipt that is sent to the fiscal printer includes the customer information.

### Scenario 2: Make a sale to a new named customer

1. Sign in to POS.
1. Add items to the cart.
1. Select **Add customer**, and then select **New**.
1. Specify the new customer's attributes. The following attributes are included:

    - Primary and/or receipt email
    - Primary phone

1. Save the customer record, and add the customer to the transaction.
1. Register payments for the transaction, and then finalize the transaction.
1. Because the inquiry for customer information has been activated, but customer information hasn't yet been added to the transaction, the **Enter customer information** dialog box appears. Select **Yes**, and then select **Copy from transaction customer**.
1. Select whether the phone number or the email address should be copied to the customer information.
1. Verify the customer information, and then select **OK**. The fiscal receipt that is sent to the fiscal printer includes the customer information.

> [!NOTE]
> To specify a different customer for a transaction, you must clear the customer information and then copy it again after the new customer is added.

### Scenario 3: Change the customer information for a sale to a named customer

1. Sign in to POS.
1. Add items to the cart.
1. Select **Add customer**, and then select the customer account to add to the transaction.
1. Select **Add customer information**, and then select **Copy from transaction customer**.
1. Select whether the phone number or the email address should be copied to the customer information.
1. Verify the customer information, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **Add customer information**, and then select **Clear** to clear the customer information from the transaction.
1. Select **Add customer information**, and then select **Enter manually**.
1. Select whether a phone number or an email address will be specified.
1. Enter the customer information, and then select **OK**.
1. Register payments for the transaction, and then finalize the transaction. The fiscal receipt that is sent to the fiscal printer includes the customer information.

## Setup

To use the customer information functionality, you must complete the following configuration steps:

- [Add the **Add customer information** operation to screen layouts](#add-the-add-customer-information-operation-to-screen-layouts).
- [Activate the inquiry for customer information](#activate-the-inquiry-for-customer-information).
- [Configure channel components](#configure-channel-components).

### Add the Add customer information operation to screen layouts

The **Add customer information** operation can be used to add customer information such as a phone number or email address to a sales transaction. This information can be copied from the customer that is specified for the transaction, or it can be manually entered.

To add the **Add customer information** operation to a screen layout in Commerce POS for Russia, follow these steps.

1. On the **Button grids** page, select the button grid where the operation should appear, and then open the button grid designer.
1. Add a new button, and then in the **Action** field, select **Add customer information**. 

For more information about how to work with screen layouts and button grids, see [POS user interface visual configurations](../pos-screen-layouts.md).

### Activate the inquiry for customer information

If customer information isn't specified for a sales transaction, an inquiry for that information can automatically be triggered after the transaction is finalized. This approach is an alternative to the **Add customer information** operation.

To activate the inquiry for customer information in Commerce, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Workspaces \> Feature management**.
1. Enable the **(Russia) Customer information management in Retail POS** feature.
1. Go to **POS functionality profiles**.
1. On the **Functions** FastTab, in the **Tax parameters** section, set the **Enable inquiry of customer information in sales transactions** option to **Yes**.

### Configure channel components

To make the functionality that is specific to Russia available, you must configure extensions for Commerce channel components. For more information, see [Enable Russia-specific Commerce components](./rus-commerce-setup.md#enable-russia-specific-commerce-components).
