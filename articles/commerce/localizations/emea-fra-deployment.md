# Deployment guidelines for cash registers for France

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic is a deployment guide that shows how to enable the Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for France. The localization consists of several extensions of components. For example, the extensions let you print custom fields on receipts, register additional audit events, sales transactions, and payment transactions in Point of Sale (POS), digitally sign sales transactions, and print X and Z reports in local formats. For more information about the localization for France, see [Cash register functionality for France](./emea-fra-cash-registers.md).

This localization is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK). For information about how to install and use the SDK, see the [Retail software development kit (SDK) architecture](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-overview.md).

This localization consists of extensions for the Commerce runtime (CRT), Retail Server, and POS. To run this sample, you must modify and build the CRT, Retail Server, and POS projects. We recommend that you use an unmodified Retail SDK to make the changes that are described in this topic. We also recommend that you use a source control system, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Online (VSO), where no files have been changed yet.

> [!NOTE]
> In Commerce 10.0.8 and above, Retail Server is known as Commerce Scale Unit. Because this topic applies to multiple previous versions of the app, *Retail Server* is used throughout the topic.

## Storing a certificate for digital signing in Azure Key Vault

The digital signature extension uses a certificate that is installed in the local certificate storage of the machine where Retail Server is deployed. The thumbprint of the certificate must be specified in the configuration file (see the [SequentialSignatureRegister component](#sequentialsignatureregister-component) section later in this topic). Depending on the implementation topology, the certificate might have to be stored in [Microsoft Azure Key Vault storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started). The localization for France contains a code sample that shows how to override the signing flow and sign sales transactions by using a certificate that is stored in Azure Key Vault storage.

### Prerequisites

The following steps must be completed before you can use a certificate that is stored in Azure Key Vault storage:

- The Azure Key Vault storage must be created. We recommend that you deploy the storage in the same geographical region as the Retail Server.
- The certificate must be uploaded to the storage.
- The Retail Server application must be authorized to read secrets from the storage.

For more information about how to work with Azure Key Vault, see [Get started with Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started).

### Using the sample

The **DigitalSignatureKeyVaultSample** project contains sample code that uses a certificate that is stored in Azure Key Vault storage. To use the sample in a production environment, you must implement logic so that the following parameters can be specified in the **HashAndSignData** method of the **CertificateSignatureServiceRequestHandler** class:

- **Azure Key Vault URL** – The URL of the Azure Key Vault storage.

    ``` csharp
    settings.Add(WellKnownKeyVaultSettings.KeyVaultUrl, "Set your Azure Key Vault URL here");
    ```

- **Client ID** – An interactive client ID of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application that is associated with the Azure Key Vault storage for authentication purposes. This client should have access to read secrets from the Azure Key Vault storage.

    ``` csharp
    settings.Add(WellKnownKeyVaultSettings.KeyVaultInteractiveClientId, "Set the client ID here");
    ```

- **Client secret** – A secret key that is associated with the Azure AD application that is used for authentication in the Azure Key Vault storage.

    ``` csharp
    // Secret key value should be encrypted and stored in a safe place.
    settings.Add(WellKnownKeyVaultSettings.KeyVaultClientSecretKey, "Set the secret key here");
    ```

- **Secret reference** – A secret reference to the certificate.

    ``` csharp
    SecretCertificate secretCertificate = settingsHelper.SecretProvider.GetSecret("vault:///{Specify the secret reference}") as SecretCertificate;
    ```

To override the signing flow, follow these steps.

1. Build the **DigitalSignatureKeyVaultSample** project, and copy the **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DigitalSignatureKeyVaultSample.dll** assembly to the **bin\\ext** Retail Server folder.
2. Update the **commerceRuntime.ext.config** file by adding the following line to the **composition** section.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DataSignatureKeyVaultSample" />
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The thumbprint of the certificate that is used for digital signing should be specified in the configuration file of the SequentialSignatureRegister assembly, even if the certificate is stored in Azure Key Vault storage. For more information, see the [SequentialSignatureRegister component](#sequentialsignatureregister-component) section later in this topic.

## Specifying application attributes that will be printed on receipts

You can use custom fields to print the following application attributes on receipts<!-- (for more information, see [Cash registers for France](./emea-fra-cash-registers.md))-->:

- **Build number** – The software version of the POS application. By default, the value should equal the POS build number that Microsoft assigned to the POS application.
- **Certificate category** and **Certificate number** – The category and number of the certificate of compliance that an accredited body issues for the application. By default, the values equal the category and the number of the certificate that is granted to Microsoft:

    - Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Commerce:

        - **Certificate category:** C
        - **Certificate number:** 18/0202

    - Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Commerce:

        - **Certificate category:** B
        - **Certificate number:** 18/0203

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the certificate category and number that are assigned are printed. If you're implementing Commerce, you must override the certificate category and number.

If you customize the POS application, and your customizations affect the compliance of the application, you might have to request a new certificate of compliance from an accredited body. In this case, you must override the build number, and the certificate category and number. Otherwise, the default values for the certificate category and number will be printed, but you must still specify the POS build number that Microsoft assigned to the POS application.

### Overriding the build number

The software version/build number and publisher are specified in **RetailSDK\\BuildTools\\Customization.settings**.

```xml
<CustomVersion Condition="'$(CustomVersion)' == ''">1.0.0.1</CustomVersion>
<CustomName Condition="'$(CustomName)' == ''">Contoso Retail Customization</CustomName> 
<CustomDescription Condition="'$(CustomDescription)' == ''">Contoso Retail Customization</CustomDescription>
<CustomPublisher Condition="'$(CustomPublisher)' == ''">CN=Contoso Ltd.</CustomPublisher>
<CustomPublisherDisplayName Condition="'$(CustomPublisherDisplayName)' == ''">Contoso Ltd.</CustomPublisherDisplayName>
<CustomCopyright Condition="'$(CustomCopyright)' == ''">Copyright © 2016</CustomCopyright>
```

### Overriding the certificate category and number

The certificate category and number are specified in **RetailSDK\\SampleExtensions\\CommerceRuntime\\Extensions.ReceiptsFrance\\GetSalesTransactionCustomReceiptFieldService**.

``` csharp
/// <summary>
/// Certification category.
/// </summary>
private const string CertificationCategory = "C";

/// <summary>
/// Certificate number.
/// </summary>
private const string CertificateNumber = "18/0202";
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must also override the certificate category and number if you're implementing Commerce. In this case, use the certificate category and number that are provided in the [Specifying application attributes that will be printed on receipts](#specifying-application-attributes-that-will-be-printed-on-receipts) section earlier in this topic.

        To use a certificate that is stored in Azure Key Vault storage for digital signing, add the following line.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Before you add this line, complete the steps in the [Storing a certificate for digital signing in Azure Key Vault](#storing-a-certificate-for-digital-signing-in-azure-key-vault) section, earlier in this topic.

        ``` xml
        <ISV_CommerceRuntime_CustomizableFile Include="$(SdkReferencesPath)\Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DataSignatureKeyVaultSample.dll" />
        ```

    3. Add the following lines to the **ItemGroup** section to include the Retail Server extension in the deployable packages.

        ``` xml
        <ISV_RetailServer_CustomizableFile Include="$(SdkReferencesPath)\Contoso.RetailServer.SalesTransactionSignatureSample.dll" />
        ```

4. Update the Retail Server configuration file. In **RetailSDK\\Packages\\RetailServer\\Code\\web.config**, add the following lines to the **extensionComposition** section.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.RetailServer.SalesTransactionSignatureSample" />
    ```

5. Modify the certificate's configuration file by specifying the thumbprint, store location, and store name for the certificate that should be used to sign sales transactions. Then copy the configuration file to the **References** folder. The file is named **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.SequentialSignatureRegister.dll.config**, and it's under **Extensions.SequentialSignatureRegister\\bin\\Debug**.
6. Override the build number and the category and number of the certificate of compliance, as required. For more information, see the instructions in the [Specifying application attributes that will be printed on receipts](#specifying-application-attributes-that-will-be-printed-on-receipts) section earlier in this topic.
7. Start the MSBuild Command Prompt for Visual Studio utility, and run **msbuild** under the Retail SDK folder to create deployable packages.
8. Apply the packages via Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) or manually. For more information, see [Create retail deployable packages](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-packaging.md).

### Enable the digital signature in offline mode for Modern POS

To enable the digital signature in offline mode for Modern POS, you must follow these steps after you activate Modern POS on a new device.

1. Sign in to POS.
2. On the **Database connection status** page, make sure that the offline database is fully synchronized. When the value of the **Pending downloads** field is **0** (zero), the database is fully synchronized.
3. Sign out of POS.
4. Wait a while for the offline database to be fully synchronized.
5. Sign in to POS.
6. On the **Database connection status** page, make sure that the offline database is fully synchronized. When the value of the **Pending transactions in offline database** field is **0** (zero), the database is fully synchronized.
