# Commerce localization for Russia

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include[banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of the localization of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce for Russia and describes the scope of Commerce functionality that is specific to Russia. It includes information about features and functionality that are designed to address specific federal tax, retail, accounting, financial, or statutory reporting laws or regulations that typically affect retail businesses in Russia (within the scope of [Russian localization](../../finance/localizations/russia.md)).

Because laws and regulations vary in the way that they affect organizations, Commerce doesn't address all laws, regulations, or commercial requirements in Russia. For more information, see the [Product localization and translation availability guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck).

To learn about point of sale (POS) features that are available to customers in all countries or regions, see the [Commerce home page](../index.md).

## Capabilities of Commerce localization for Russia

### Eastern Europe-specific POS features

The following Eastern Europeâ€“specific POS features are enabled after the Commerce localization for Russia has been set up:

- Customer cash payments according to the retail store cash management requirements.
- Cash payments that use petty cash journals in Commerce headquarters.
- Retail transactions that are aggregated according to specific criteria or posted separately.

For more information, see [Petty cash management for Commerce for Eastern Europe](emea-eeu-petty-cash-for-retail.md).

### Russia-specific POS features

The following Russia-specific POS features are enabled after the Commerce localization for Russia has been set up:

- A sample integration of the POS with a fiscal printer.
- Customer account deposit and customer order deposit prepayments.
- Prepayments and posting of VAT for prepayments in Commerce headquarters.
- Prepayment cancellation charges.
- Simplified address format.

### Fiscal registration for Russia

Fiscal registration is the immediate registration of retail sales per local fiscal laws that are aimed at preventing tax fraud in the retail industry. The main fiscal registration method available in Russia entails using a specialized device called a fiscal printer or online cash register that is connected to POS.

Commerce functionality for Russia includes a [sample integration](./rus-fpi-sample.md) of the point of sale (POS) with a fiscal printer. This sample extends the [fiscal integration functionality](./fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md) and supports the application programming interface (API) of fiscal printers from [ATOL](http://integration.atol.ru/). It enables communication with a fiscal printer that is connected via a communication (COM) port by using a native software driver. The sample is provided in the form of source code and is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK).
