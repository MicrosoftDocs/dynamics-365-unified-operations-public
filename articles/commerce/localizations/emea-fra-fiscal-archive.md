# Fiscal archive for France

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the fiscal archive and the Fiscal archive integrity verification tool that are available in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for France. The fiscal archive is part of the [cash register functionality for France](./emea-fra-cash-registers.md).

A fiscal archive is an XML file that contains sales data for a store and a fiscal period. It includes the totals for the closed period, and detailed data about sales transactions and events.

A fiscal archive can be exported from a closed period grand total journal. (For more information about how to work with period grand total journals, see [Period grand total journal](./emea-fra-cash-registers.md#period-grand-total-journal).) The exported fiscal archive XML file is digitally signed, and the digital signature is contained in a separate file. Exported fiscal archives must be kept on secured external media for the legal retention period.

You can verify the integrity of the fiscal archive and its data by using the [Fiscal archive integrity verification tool](#fiscal-archive-integrity-verification-tool).

The XML format of the fiscal archive is implemented by using [Electronic reporting (ER)](../../dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md). For information about how to import and apply the ER configurations that are required to export fiscal archives, see [Configure the Z report and archive export formats](./emea-fra-cash-registers.md#configure-the-z-report-and-archive-export-formats).

## Fiscal archive structure

A fiscal archive has the following structure.

``` xml
<AchivePeriod> <!-- The identification of the period of the archive and the archive creation date. -->
    <Company/> <!-- The identification of the company, including the SIRET code, the NAF code, and the VAT ID of the company. -->
    <Store/> <!-- The identification of the store, including its address. -->
    <PeriodGrandTotal/> <!-- The data of the period grand total journal that the archive was exported from. -->
    <Shifts/> <!-- A collection of all shifts that were closed in the store during the period of the archive. -->
        <Shift/> <!-- The data of a shift. -->
    <Receipts/> <!-- A collection of all sales receipts that were registered in the shifts included in the archive. -->
        <Receipt/> <!-- The data of a sales receipt. -->
    <ReceiptCopies/> <!-- A collection of all sales receipt copies that were printed in the shifts included in the archive. -->
        <ReceiptCopy> <!-- The data of a sales receipt copy. -->
    <AuditEvents> <!-- A collection of all signed audit events that were registered in the shifts included in the archive. -->
        <AuditEvent/> <!-- The data of a signed audit event. -->
```

## Fiscal archive integrity verification tool

The Fiscal archive integrity verification tool can be used to verify the integrity of a fiscal archive, and to detect violations of the signature of the archive and of the chains of signed records in the archive. The tool should be applied to a fiscal archive file and the corresponding signature file. When it's run, the tool performs the following actions:

1. Verify the signature of the fiscal archive file.
1. Verify signatures and signature chains of all fiscal archive records. (These records are the period grand total journal, shift, receipt, receipt copy, and audit event records.) For each record, the tool performs these actions:

    1. Build a text string from data elements of the record, according to the [digital signing rules](./emea-fra-cash-registers.md#digital-signing-overview) and the internal version of the format of data that was used to sign the record. These elements include the signature of the previous record of the same type.
    1. Calculate a hash code of the string by using the hash algorithm that was used to hash the data of the record before signing.
    1. Decrypt the signature of the record by using the public key of the digital certificate that was used to sign the record.
    1. Compare the result with the hash code that was calculated earlier.

1. Print all integrity violations that are found.

The Fiscal archive integrity verification tool takes the form of a Windows PowerShell script and is published via the Commerce software development kit (SDK).

To obtain the Fiscal archive integrity verification tool and run it against a fiscal archive, follow these steps.

1. Download the tool from the Commerce SDK:

    1. Open the [Dynamics 365 Commerce Solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/) repository.
    1. Open the last available release branch (for example, **[release/9.30](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.Solutions/tree/release/9.30)**).
    1. Open **src \> FiscalIntegration \> SequentialSignatureFrance \> FiscalArchiveIntegrityVerificationTool**.
    1. Review the license terms for the tool.
    1. Download the contents of the folder to your local machine.

1. Export public key files for all digital certificates that are used for digital signing of records.
1. Put the fiscal archive file, its signature file, and all public key files into one folder.
1. Run Windows PowerShell.
1. Run the **verify.ps1** script of the tool, and specify the name of the fiscal archive file. Include the full path of the file.
1. Review any integrity violations that are found.
