# Return items across multiple customer orders and invoices

Returns can be made across multiple orders and invoices. 

## Configure Commerce to support returns across multiple customer order and invoices

1. Go to **Commerce parameters \> Customer orders**.
1. Turn on the **Enable returns for multiple orders** parameter. 

## Process returns

After the parameter is turned on and the changes are synchronized to the stores, the cashier in the store can select multiple sales orders for a customer for their return.

When the orders are selected, a list of all the returnable products across all the invoices for the orders will display. The cashier can then select the products to return. A single return order will be created for all the selected products.
