**Build 8.1.1015.0**

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Core HR.

## Currency added to Benefits

Benefit plans have been updated to include the currency of the benefit. This new
field is also available on worker enrolled benefits.

## Update proration process – Leave and Absence

Organizations award time off differently based on when employees join and leave
the company. For employees leaving the organization, some may need to end the
award on the termination date, while others rely on the last day worked to stop
the accrual process. These changes provide organizations the ability to choose
when to end enrollment during the termination process.

## Other changes

This release includes several additional bug fixes.

## Known Issue

-   When adding a new attachment to a worker the new button is disabled, this is a known
    issue. Workaround: Before opening the attachment page, make sure the fact
    boxes on the worker page are “closed”. If the fact boxes are closed when the
    worker page is loaded the attachments buttons will be enabled. (This issue
    is fixed in the next platform update).
