# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (May 20, 2019)

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Changes in Attract
This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract.

## Coming soon in Attract

### Job approvals on home page

Approvals appear in an **Approvals** section on the dashboard. Approvers can review their approvals under **Assigned to you**, which displays the job ID, title, other approvers, and date assigned. Users who submit a job for approval can review their jobs under **Requested by you**, which displays the approvers who still need to approve the submitted job.

## Changes in Onboard

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard.

## Changes in Core HR

Changes described in this section apply to build number 8.1.2306. This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Core HR.

## In preview in Core HR

### New page to validate position hierarchy data

Human resources (HR) and administrators can validate the managerial hierarchy for any circular references that might have been inadvertently imported. You can access this new page from **Organizational administration > Links > Positions > Position hierarchy validation**.

### Specify reason codes on leave types

Organizations might require additional information about time-off requests. You can now specify reason codes for leave types and let employees select a reason code on their time-off requests.

### Require reason codes for specific leave types on time-off requests

Organizations might require reason codes for specific leave types when employees submit time-off requests. This requirement might exist because of company policy or regulatory requirements. You can specify which leave types require a reason code, and you can require that employees provide a reason code for the leave type on their time-off requests.

### Provide a leave and absence transaction list for HR

The ability to track employee time off and understand how time off is calculated not only helps HR answer employee questions, but also helps ensure accurate time-off awards for employees. HR now has a new view into the transactions (grants, accruals, adjustments, and requests), so that HR staff can view the reasons behind time-off balances.
