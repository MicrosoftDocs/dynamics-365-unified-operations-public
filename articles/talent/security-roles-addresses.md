# Access to private addresses by security role

**Issue**

After a customer duplicates a security role and signs in as that new role, the customer can't see addresses that were marked as private.

**Resolution**

To resolve the issue, the customer must follow these steps for the duplicated security role.

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Global address book \> Global address book parameters**.
2. On the **Private location security** tab, move the new security role from the **Available roles** list to the **Selected roles** list.
3. Select **Save**.
