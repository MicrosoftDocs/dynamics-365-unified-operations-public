# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (May 13, 2019)

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Coming soon in Attract

### Job approvals on home page

Approvals appear in an **Approvals** section on the dashboard. Approvers can review their approvals under **Assigned to you**, which displays the job ID, title, other approvers, and date assigned. Users who submit a job for approval can review their jobs under **Requested by you**, which displays the approvers who still need to approve the submitted job.

## Changes in Onboard

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard.

## Changes in Core HR

Changes described in this section apply to build number 8.1.2297. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to support numbers in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Indicate instance type when provisioning Talent

When provisioning a new instance of Talent, you can indicate whether the instance type is **Production** or **Sandbox**, which allows for early testing of new features. All existing Talent instances will be updated to the **Production** instance type. If you want one of your existing instances to be updated to the **Sandbox** instance type, please contact [Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/talent-support) to initiate the change request.

### Common Data Service entity support for custom fields

In this week's release, the following Common Data Service entities now support custom fields: Employment, Benefit calc frequency, Benefit calc rate, Work calendar holiday, and Identification type.

### Common Data Service integration page

This release provides a new option in **System Administration > Links > Integrations > Common Data Service configuration**. The **Common Data Service configuration** option allows an administrator or data management administrator some flexibility and insights with the Common Data Service. With this option, you can enable or disable Common Data Service integration with a Talent instance and view the sync details between the Talent instance and the Common Data Service.

### Import performance data with final employee rating (316710)

In this release, you can import historical employee rating data. The **FinalEmployeeRatingId** field now has write permission.

### Can't create Worker address in Common Data Service and sync it with Talent (317555)

This change allows address data created in Common Data Service to sync with Talent.

## In preview

### New page to validate position hierarchy data

Human resources (HR) and administrators can validate the managerial hierarchy for any circular references that might have been inadvertently imported. You can access this new page from **Organizational administration > Links > Positions > Position hierarchy validation**.

### Specify reason codes on leave types

Organizations might require additional information about time-off requests. You can now specify reason codes for leave types and let employees select a reason code on their time-off requests.

### Require reason codes for specific leave types on time-off requests

Organizations might require reason codes for specific leave types when employees submit time-off requests. This requirement might exist because of company policy or regulatory requirements. You can specify which leave types require a reason code, and you can require that employees provide a reason code for the leave type on their time-off requests.

### Provide a leave and absence transaction list for HR

The ability to track employee time off and understand how time off is calculated not only helps HR answer employee questions, but also helps ensure accurate time-off awards for employees. HR now has a new view into the transactions (grants, accruals, adjustments, and requests), so that HR staff can view the reasons behind time-off balances.
