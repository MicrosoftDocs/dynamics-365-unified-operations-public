# Analytic reports are not updated

**Issue**

A customer's data changes don't appear on the **Analytics** tabs of any of the customer's workspaces.

**Cause**

By default, Microsoft Power BI reports are refreshed every four hours, according to the schedule of the Deploy measurement batch job.

**Resolution**

This issue might just be a matter of timing. Follow these steps to start the batch job and update the analytics workspaces.

1. Open the **Batch jobs** page at **System administration \> Links \> Batch jobs \> Batch jobs**. Alternatively, use Search, and enter **Batch Jobs**.
1. Find the **Deploy measurement** job in the list.
1. Select **Edit** at the top of the page, and set the scheduled start date/time to a value that will refresh the analytics closer to the current time.
