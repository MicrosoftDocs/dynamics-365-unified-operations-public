# Provision Talent

This topic walks you through the process of provisioning a new production environment for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent. This topic assumes that you've purchased Talent through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) or enterprise architecture (EA) agreement. If you have an existing Microsoft Dynamics 365 license that already includes the Talent service plan, and you can't complete the steps in this topic, contact Support.

To begin, the global administrator should sign in to [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com) (LCS) and create a new Talent project. Unless a licensing issue prevents you from provisioning Talent, assistance from Support or Dynamics Service Engineering (DSE) representatives isn't required.

## Create an LCS project
To use LCS to manage your Talent environments, you must first create an LCS project.

1. Sign in to [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Index) by using the account that you used to subscribe to Talent.
2. Select the plus sign (**+**) to create a project.
3. Select **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent** as the product name and product version.
4. Select the **Dynamics 365 Talent** methodology.
5. Select **Create**.

For information about how to get started with Talent, see the **Talent** methodology that you created in your new project. After you've finished creating the project, complete the following procedure to provision your Talent environment.

## Provision a Talent project
After you've created an LCS project, you can provision Talent into an environment.

1. In your LCS project, select the **Talent App Management** tile.
2. Indicate whether this is a Sandbox or Production instance of Talent. Early preview features may be available in Sandbox instances to allow for early feedback and testing. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > The Talent instance type is separate from the instance type of the Microsoft Power Apps environment, which you set in the Power Apps Admin center.
3. Select the **Include Demo Data** option if you want your environment to include the same demo data set used in the Talent Test Drive experience. This is beneficial for long-term demo or training environments, and should never be used for production environments.  Note that you must choose this option upon initial deployment. You cannot update an existing deployment later.
4. Talent is always provisioned into a Microsoft Power Apps environment to enable Power Apps integration and extensibility. Read the “Selecting a Power Apps environment” section of this topic before you continue. If you don't already have a Power Apps environment, select Manage environments in LCS or navigate to the Power Apps Admin center. Then follow the steps to [Create a Power Apps environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/administrator/create-environment).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To view existing environments or create new environments, the tenant admin who provisions Talent must be assigned to the Power Apps P2 license. If your organization doesn't have a Power Apps P2 license, you can get one from your CSP or from the [Power Apps pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

5. Select the environment to provision Talent into.
6. Select **Yes** to agree to the terms and begin deployment.

    Your new environment appears in the list of environments in the navigation pane on the left. However, you can't start to use the environment until the deployment status is updated to **Deployed**. This process typically takes a few minutes. If the provisioning process is unsuccessful, you must contact Support.

7. Select **Log on to Talent** to use your new environment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you haven't yet signed off on the final requirements, you can deploy a test instance of Talent in the project. You can then use this instance to test your solution until you sign off. If you use your new environment for testing, you must repeat this procedure to create a production environment.

    > Because only two LCS environments are allowed as part of the Talent subscription, you might consider leveraging a free 60-day [Talent trial environment](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/talent/overview/). Although a trial environment is owned by the user who requested it, other users can be invited through the system administration experience for Core HR. Trial environments contain fictitious data that can be used to explore the program in a safe manner. They aren't intended to be used as production environments. Note that when a trial environment expires after 60 days, all the data that's in it is deleted and can't be recovered. You can sign up for a new trial environment after the existing environment expires.

## Select a Power Apps environment

The integration between Talent and the Power Apps environments lets you integrate and extend the use of Talent data using Power Apps tools. Understanding the purpose of Power Apps environments will not only help you build apps to extend Talent, but will also help you select the correct environment when provisioning Talent. For information about Power Apps environments, including environment scope, environment access, and creating and choosing an environment, see [Announcing Power Apps environments](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/powerapps-environments/). 

Use the following guidance when determining which Power Apps environment to deploy Talent into: 

1. In LCS, select **Manage environments**, or go directly to the Power Apps Admin center where you can view existing environments and create new environments.
2. A single Talent environment is mapped to a single Power Apps environment.
3. A Power Apps environment contains Talent, along with the corresponding Power Apps, Power Automate, and Common Data Service applications. If the Power Apps environment is deleted, so are the apps within it. When provisioning a Talent environment, you can provision either a **Trial** or **Production** environment. Choose the type of environment based on how the environment will be used. 
4. Data integration and testing strategies should be considered, such as Sandbox, UAT, or Production. We recommend that you consider the various implications for your deployment, because it isn't easy to later change which Talent environment is mapped to a Power Apps environment.
5. The following Power Apps environments cannot be used for Talent and will be filtered from the selection list within LCS:
 
    - **Default Power Apps environments** - Although each tenant is automatically provisioned with a default Power Apps environment, we don't recommend using them with Talent because all tenant users have access to the Power Apps environment and could unintentionally corrupt production data when testing and exploring with Power Apps or Power Automate integrations.
   
    - **Trial environments** - These environments are created with an expiration date and will expire after that time, causing your environment and any Talent instances contained within to be removed automatically.
   
    - **Unsupported regions** - Currently Talent is only supported in the following regions: United States, Europe, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Asia.
  
6. After you have determined the correct environment to use, you can continue with the provisioning process. 
 
## Grant access to the environment
By default, the global administrator who created the environment has access to it. However, additional application users must be explicitly granted access. To grant access, you need to add users and assign the appropriate roles to them in the Core HR environment. The global administrator that deployed Talent must also launch both Attract and Onboard to complete the initialization and enable access for other tenant users.  Until this happens, other users will not be able to access Attract and Onboard and will get access violation errors. For more information, see [Create new users](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/sysadmin/tasks/create-new-users) and [Assign users to security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/sysadmin/tasks/assign-users-security-roles).
