## In preview

### Preview features are enabled only in sandbox instances

When you provision a new instance of Talent, you can specify whether the instance type is **Production** or **Sandbox**. Instances of the **Sandbox** type allow for early testing of new features. All existing Talent instances will be updated to the **Production** instance type. If you want one of your existing instances to be updated to the **Sandbox** instance type, contact [Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/talent-support) to initiate the change request.

For more information about how changes are published, see [Provision Talent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/provisioning-talent).

### Restrict leave types in time-off requests

Organizations can offer many different types of leave to employees. However, it might not be appropriate for employees to submit time-off requests for some leave types. Those leave types might be managed by HR instead. In this release, you can configure which leave types employees can submit time-off requests for. 

### View performance information for direct and extended reports in manager self-service

A new option will let managers view the performance of both their direct reports and their extended reports. Currently, line managers can assign and update performance goals and issue new reviews. In addition, direct managers and their employees can maintain and update performance journals to help ensure that the performance review process goes smoothly. When this change is implemented, managers will be able to view and maintain performance-related information for their extended reports in addition to their direct reports.
