## Changes in Core HR

The changes that are described in this section apply to build number 8.1.2542. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to support numbers in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Removal of benefits open enrollment from public preview

In conjunction with our announcement in the [Strategic investments in core HR drive operational excellence](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/10/02/strategic-investments-in-core-hr-drive-operational-excellence/) blog post, Microsoft is removing the benefits open enrollment feature from public preview on October 18, 2019. Instead, new functionality will be released in the future. Production use of the benefits open enrollment feature that is currently in public preview won't be supported. 

### Common Data Service integration is now turned off by default on new provisions (343675)
 
When new environments are provisioned, Common Data Service integration is now turned off. For more information, see [Configure Common Data Service integration](hr-common-data-service-integration.md).

### Streamlined employee entry and navigation

Functionality for employee entry and navigation is now available in all environments. To turn on this feature, go to **System administration \> Links \> Setup \> System parameters \> Preview features**, and select **Enhanced worker form and navigation**. The feature is then turned for all users. You can turn this option off at any time.

For more information, see [Streamlined employee data entry](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-talent/streamlined-employee-data-entry) in the Dynamics 365: 2019 release wave 2 plan.
