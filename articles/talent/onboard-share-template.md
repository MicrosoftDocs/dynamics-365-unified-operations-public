Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard lets you share onboarding guides and templates with other contributors so that they can review the documents and make changes.

## Share an onboarding guide with other contributors

1. On the left menu, select **Guides**, and then select the guide that you want to share.
2. Select the **More** button (the three vertical dots) in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select **Share**.

3. Under **Share with**, if recipients should be able to revise the guide, set the **Can these people make edits?** option to **On**. If recipients should be notified by email that you've shared the guide with them, set the **Send email notification to recipients** option to **On**.

4. Enter a name or email address, and select the desired recipient in the drop-down list.
5. On the **Manage access** tab, you can review or change what recipients can do with the guide. To change a recipient's access, in the drop-down list next to the recipient's name, select **Can View**, **Can edit**, or **Remove**, as appropriate.
6. When you've finished adding or modifying recipients, select **Update**.

## Share an onboarding template with other contributors
