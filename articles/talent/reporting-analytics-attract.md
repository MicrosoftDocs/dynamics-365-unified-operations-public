Job Analytics
-------------

*Job Analytics* reports are a snapshot of the hiring process for job. Key
metrics include:

-   Active applicants

-   Applicant type (Internal vs External)

-   Applications over time

Analytics Hub
-------------

*Analytics Hub* reports aggregate job data to surface trends in the hiring
process. Key metrics include:

-   Open Jobs by seniority level

-   Rejected applicants by reason

-   Applicants across all jobs by stage

Role-level Security
-------------------

Attract Reports are accessible for Admin, Read only, Recruiter, and Hiring
manager [Roles](./security-attract.md). Unassigned users do not have access to either of the analytic
report pages (*Job Analytics* or *Analytics Hub*).

*Job Analytics* reports display data for the selected job. Users with hiring
manager and recruiter participant roles can access *Job Analytics* for the
selected job. Admin and Read only users can access *Job Analytics* for all jobs.

*Analytics Hub* reports aggregate data across jobs where the user is a hiring
manager or recruiter participant. Admin, Read only, Recruiter, and Hiring manager
[Roles](./Security-in-Attract.md) can access the *Analytics Hub*.

To learn more about Roles, see the [Security in Attract](./security-attract.md) topic.

Cross-filter
------------

Users can filter a report based on data selected in a visual. For example,
clicking “Internal” in an applicant type visual filters the report for internal
applicants. Tiles such as Active applicants will be filtered for internal,
active applicants and other visuals such as Rejected applicants, will highlight
the portion corresponding to internal, rejected applicants.
