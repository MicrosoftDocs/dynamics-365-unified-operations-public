# Set up your career site in Attract

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of the candidate-facing career site
functionality in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract. It also explains
how to set up this functionality.

Attract provides one career site for each environment in a tenant. For example,
if an organization has a development environment and a test environment, one
career site is provisioned for the development environment, and another career
site is provisioned for the test environment. Each career site is completely
isolated and has its own authentication mechanism. Jobs and candidate profiles
aren't shared between career sites.

By default, the career site is public. Therefore, candidates can view all jobs
that are marked as external without having to sign in. However, all other
actions require that candidates sign in.

## Career site management

To set the values for the following items, sign in to Attract as an administrator,
select **Admin center** on the **Settings** menu (the gear symbol), and then
select the **Company information** tab.

-   **Organization name** - The organization name appears on the navigation bar
    at the top of the career site. By selecting the organization name,
    candidates go to a page that lists all open jobs.

-   **Organization logo** - An image of the organization's logo appears in the
    upper left of the career site. By selecting the logo image, candidates go to
    a page that lists all open jobs.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > The logo image that appears on the career site has a fixed height of 20 pixels (px). The image that you add in the Admin center is  scaled to fit. Therefore, depending on the image, the width might change.
 
To set the values for the following items, sign in to Attract as an administrator,
select **Admin center** on the **Settings** menu, and then
select the **Career site management** tab.

-   **Search Engine Optimization** - When enabled, all public jobs posted to
    Attract career site will be searchable using search engines like Bing
    and Google. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > There might be a delay between turning this setting on and search results appearing, depending on the search engine that you are using.
    
-   **Terms and Conditions** - When enabled, all candidates must consent to the organization's terms and conditions when applying for any job. The Attract Administrator is able to configure their own Consent text as well as the link to their Terms and Conditions page. 

        
## Career site URLs

The following list contains the commonly used career site URLs and how to access them.

-   **Career site home page URL** - To view the career site home page URL, sign
    in to Attract as an administrator, select **Admin center** on the **Settings** menu, and then select the **Career site management** tab.

-   **Individual job post apply URL** - When you [post an external
    job](Creating-jobs-Attract.md#postings) for the first time, you can copy
    the **Apply** link from Attract. The URL for this link will
    be in the following format: 
    [https://jobs.talent.dynamics.com/jobs/\<company_name\>/\<environment_number\>/\<job_number\>/apply](https://jobs.talent.dynamics.com/jobs/%3ccompany_name%3e/%3cenvironment_number%3e/%3cjob_number%3e/apply)

-   **Individual job post URL** - The URL of the job post is a substring of the
    Apply URL. It consists of everything up through the job number. Therefore,
    for the preceding Apply URL, the job post URL is
    [https://jobs.talent.dynamics.com/jobs/\<company_name\>/\<environment_number\>/\<job_number\>](https://jobs.talent.dynamics.com/jobs/%3ccompany_name%3e/%3cenvironment_number%3e/%3cjob_number%3e)

## Authentication options

Candidates have the following sign-in options for an Attract career site:

-   Personal account:

    -   LinkedIn

    -   Microsoft

    -   Google

    -   Facebook

-   Work or school account:

    -   Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

Azure AD sign-in is intended only for internal candidates. Therefore, it works
only for internal candidates who use their company Azure AD credentials. For
example, a candidate who is currently an employee of Contoso Ltd wants to apply
for a job in an unrelated company, Alpine Ski House. In this case, the sign-in
will be unsuccessful if the employee tries to use Azure AD
credentials from Contoso Ltd. 

Candidates must sign in by using Azure AD if the job that they are viewing or applying for is listed as internal only.

## Create and maintain a profile

After candidates sign in to the career site, they can select **My profile** on
the navigation bar at the top of the page to create and maintain their profile.
The profile includes personal information, information about work experience,
education details, documents, links, and information about skill sets. After a
profile is created, it can be used to apply for jobs that the candidate is
interested in. Profiles also help Attract recommend the right jobs to
candidates.

> [!NOTE]
> If a candidate uses an email ID to sign in using one of the authentication providers listed above, that email ID will default to the contact email ID associated with the profile. However, the latter can be changed at any time and is completely independent of the former. Attract will always use the contact email ID to associate with your profile for all email communications.

## Find the right job

On the job list page, candidates can search for a specific job by entering
search terms. The search functionality looks for the search terms in job titles
and job descriptions, and shows relevant jobs as results. Candidates can filter
the results at any time, based on the job location or job function.

Candidates can also view a set of recommended jobs on the career site. The jobs
that are recommended to a candidate are based on the candidate's past
applications, profile, and resumes.

> [!NOTE] 
> Job recommendations are shown only if at least 10 jobs are posted on the career site, and if the candidate has completed a profile.

Internal candidates can also see who the hiring manager and/or recruiter for a job is, in case they want to contact those members of the hiring team. However, external candidates have no visibility into the members of the hiring team for any job.

## Contact the hiring team
Only internal candidates can contact the hiring team. This limitation applies to all jobs, regardless of whether they are internal only or were publicly posted.

Candidates might want to contact the hiring team to express interest in a job that was posted or learn more about it. They can contact any of the hiring team members who are listed (hiring manager or recruiters). They can also optionally attach a resume to the message, or they can select an existing resume they previously uploaded as part of their profile.

After an internal candidate selects the hiring team members to contact, Attract sends an email to those people on the candidate's behalf. At the same time, the candidate's profile is added to the **Prospect** stage, if that stage is available for the job. Under the **Prospect** stage, recruiters or hiring managers can view the candidates who have contacted them. They can also review candidate profiles and invite potential candidates to apply.

Candidates can apply for a job that they have already contacted hiring team members about. After they apply, candidates can no longer contact the hiring team through the career site.

## Apply for jobs

After candidates find the right job, they can apply by using
the **Apply** button on the **Job details** page. At this point, candidates can
either create a new profile or review the information in their existing profile.
Candidates can also upload a resume, as required, and then submit the job
application.

### Enable applying for jobs with LinkedIn profiles

You can make it easy for candidates to apply for your positions by configuring Attract to allow them to apply through LinkedIn.

> [!NOTE] 
> You need to have one or more recruiter licenses from LinkedIn before you can allow candidates to apply with LinkedIn.

1. Sign in to Attract as an admin.
2. Select the **Settings** button (the gear symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select **Admin center**.
3. Select the **LinkedIn Integration** tab and connect with a LinkedIn recruiter account.
4. In the **LinkedIn Recruiter System Connect Integration** section, select **Enabled** for the **Apply with LinkedIn** setting.

After you've enabled the setting, candidates can apply using their existing LinkedIn profile data. When candidates apply by choosing the **Apply with LinkedIn** button, they are asked to authenticate with LinkedIn if they're not already signed in. After they've authenticated, their LinkedIn profile replaces any existing profile data shown in the application page. Candidates can edit the information as needed and then submit the application. If a candidate navigates away from the page without applying for the job, their profile data is not updated in Attract.

## Check application status

After candidates apply for one or more jobs, they can select **Applications** on
the navigation bar at the top of the page to view their open and closed
applications. When candidates open one of their applications, they see the
current stage and any pending action items that they must complete. For example,
if a candidate must provide potential dates for an in-person interview, the page
shows the available options.

## Internal jobs

Currently, jobs that are marked as internal and posted to the Attract career
site don't appear on the career site. They are only accessible using the direct
**Apply** URL that can be copied from the Attract application.
