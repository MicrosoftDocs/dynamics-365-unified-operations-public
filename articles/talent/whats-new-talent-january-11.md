# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent - Core HR (January 11, 2019)

**Build 8.1.2100**

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Core HR.

## Changes

### Validate leave requests by forecasting available balance
Changes made in this release allow employees to request future leave time without subtracting from their current balance. Standard workflows will be used for any future requests made. For more information, read [Accrue time off based on hours worked](leave-accrue-hours-worked.md).

### View forecasted leave balance in ESS and People
This feature enables viewing of balances for future leave periods by HR, managers, and employees. Employees can view future balances in the **Employee Self-Service** workspace and HR has access to the same information using the **People** workspace.

### Notifications for changing leave balances
Leave balances will display the employees current balance. Future balances are available on the **Employee Self-Service** and **People** workspaces by entering an “as of date” to calculate the forecasted balance.

Navigation has been added to view forecasted balances in the following areas:
  - **Time off** card on the **Employee Self-Service** workspace.
  - **Leave and absence** card on the **Manager Self-Service** workspace.
  - **Leave and absence** page on the **People** workspace.

### Allow decimals for Variable compensation plans (Cash plans)
Variable cash awards and plans now have the additional flexibility for amounts and overrides for values with decimal amounts.

### Unable to change the dates on Variable comp enrollments after the plan is saved
This change allows for the plan end date to be updated (extended or expired) after the plan has been saved. You can still activate or de-activate plans independent of start and end dates.

### Payroll information available when assigned the Payroll admin security role
The Payroll Administrator role has been updated to have access to the payroll information during the request process.

### Employee self-service | Position hierarchy drill-down from tile fails to get parent node
Changes have been made to eliminate an error that occurred when adding the position hierarchy to new workspaces and navigating within the organizational structure.

### New validation message when personnel number sequence is in use
A change has been made to clarify what the issue is when you hire an employee and the next personnel number is in use.

### Employee self-service workspace selected as the initial startup page
When the **Employee self-service** workspace is selected as the initial startup page for a user and that user is not assigned the employee role, the system will redirect to the default dashboard.

### Termination reason code updates position assignment record
The termination reason code will now update the position assignment when terminating an employee and ending the position.
