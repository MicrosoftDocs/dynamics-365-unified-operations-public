# Set up LinkedIn integration with Attract

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Help your recruiters and hiring managers attract top talent by configuring LinkedIn integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract. Attract lets you post jobs directly to LinkedIn, the largest professional online network.

Jobs that you post to LinkedIn through Attract are Limited Listings and are provided at no extra cost to your company. These listings are available only through LinkedIn software partners such as Attract. They don't appear in the **Careers** panel on your company's LinkedIn page, because only paid listings appear there. However, they are shown when potential candidates view all available jobs. Limited Listings are also shown in LinkedIn job searches.

Attract provides two ways to integrate with LinkedIn to help you source candidates from this popular career site:

- Post jobs from Attract to LinkedIn.
- Source candidates from LinkedIn to Attract.

You configure both options on the **LinkedIn Integration** tab in the Admin center. To open the Admin center, go to <https://attract.talent.dynamics.com/adminsettings>.

> [!NOTE]
> To use LinkedIn Recruiter integration with Attract, you need the [Comprehensive hiring add-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/attract-comprehensive-hiring) and [LinkedIn Recruiter licenses](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/cx/17/08/recruiter-demo-fs2-k18). For more information, see [Which version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](./attract-comprehensive-hiring.md).

If you're having trouble posting jobs to LinkedIn, see [Troubleshooting integration with LinkedIn and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](./attract-troubleshoot-linkedin.md).

For information about other ways to post jobs to LinkedIn, see [Attract integration with LinkedIn FAQ](./attract-linkedin-faq.md).

## Configure job posting to LinkedIn

Before you can post jobs from Attract to LinkedIn, you need a [LinkedIn Company ID](https://aka.ms/findID). Your LinkedIn Company ID is a string of numbers that uniquely identifies your company in LinkedIn. For more information, see [Associating your LinkedIn Company ID with the LinkedIn Job Board - Frequently Asked Questions](https://aka.ms/findID).

Attract sends a feed of your job postings to LinkedIn, and LinkedIn checks for the feed approximately once per day. It can take up to 48 hours for your jobs to be posted to the site.

Jobs that are posted to LinkedIn appear on the live LinkedIn site. LinkedIn doesn't have a test environment for posting jobs. Therefore, make sure that you don't accidentally post any test jobs. 

1. On the **Setup** menu (the gear symbol) in the upper-right corner, select **Admin center**. Alternatively, go to <https://attract.talent.dynamics.com/adminsettings>.
2. Select the **LinkedIn Integration** tab.
3. Under **Company name**, enter the name of your company, and under **Company ID**, enter your LinkedIn Company ID. Make sure that the company name matches the name that appears on your company's LinkedIn page. For more information about LinkedIn Company IDs, see [Associating your LinkedIn Company ID with the LinkedIn Job Board - Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/98972).

    If you need to change any information for your organization, see [Change your organization's address, technical contact, and more](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more). If you still have issues, contact [LinkedIn support](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin).

4. Select **Save**.
