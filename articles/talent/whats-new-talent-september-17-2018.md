# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent - Core HR (September 17, 2018)

**Build 8.1.154.0**

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Core HR.

## Leave and Absence – Accrue time based on hours worked

A new accrual type has been added to Leave plans. The accrual schedule can now be based on months of service or hours worked. For more information, see [Accrue time off based on hours worked](leave-accrue-hours-worked.md).

## Platform update 18 for Finance and Operations

Platform update 18 for Finance and Operations is now part of the Talent release. 

-   Mandatory and other fields can be hidden via personalization. This allows a user to create a simplified experience where mandatory fields that are defaulted by business logic are not shown. Hidden mandatory fields are also temporarily made visible if they are empty when a save is attempted.

-   In Platform update 18 for Finance and Operations, the Talent web client now aligns its visuals with Microsoft Fluent Design.

    -   When fields are in “read mode”, you can simply select the edit option in the fields to switch the form to edit.

    -   Changes in how fields display when in read mode.

    -   Headings in workspaces and pages are bold.

-   The behavior of non-replacing lookups has been improved. For more information, see [Improved behavior for non-replacing
    lookups](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/October18/dynamics365-finance-operations/non-replacing-lookups).

## Bug fixes

This release includes several additional bug fixes, including references to ACA, ADA, and I9 now will only be enabled in US companies.
