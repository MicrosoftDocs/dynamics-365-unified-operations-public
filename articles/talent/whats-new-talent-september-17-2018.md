# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent: Core HR (September 17, 2018)

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

**Build 8.1.154.0**

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Core HR.

## Leave and Absence – Accrue time based on hours worked

A new accrual type has been added to Leave plans. The accrual schedule can now be based on months of service or hours worked. For more information, see [Accrue time off based on hours worked](leave-accrue-hours-worked.md).

## Platform update 18 for Finance and Operations

Platform update 18 for Finance and Operations is now part of the Talent release. 

-   Mandatory and other fields can be hidden via personalization. This allows a user to create a simplified experience where mandatory fields that are defaulted by business logic are not shown. Hidden mandatory fields are also temporarily made visible if they are empty when a save is attempted.

-   In Platform update 18 for Finance and Operations, the Talent web client now aligns its visuals with Microsoft Fluent Design.

    -   When fields are in “read mode”, you can simply select the edit option in the fields to switch the form to edit.

    -   Changes in how fields display when in read mode.

    -   Headings in workspaces and pages are bold.

-   The behavior of non-replacing lookups has been improved. For more information, see [Improved behavior for non-replacing
    lookups](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fbusiness-applications-release-notes%2FOctober18%2Fdynamics365-finance-operations%2Fnon-replacing-lookups&data=02%7C01%7C%7Ce0b3b3bee47b4424aaa208d619ce86f2%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636724772137980342&sdata=RN1qjtZSLtS010zgs0KlcwFrrB8Z7uWWGtFjdxdaamg%3D&reserved=0).

## Bug fixes

This release includes several additional bug fixes, including references to ACA, ADA, and I9 now will only be enabled in US companies.
