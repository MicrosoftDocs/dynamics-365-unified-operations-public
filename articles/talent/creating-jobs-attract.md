# Create, approve, and post jobs in Attract

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the elements of a job in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Attract. It also explains how to create a job.

## Job creation

Admins, recruiters, and hiring managers can create jobs. When you create a job, you're prompted to select your role in the process: hiring manager or recruiter. After you select a role, you're prompted to select a process template. If you select **Skip**, the default template is used. For more information about process templates, see [Create a process template in Attract](./process-templates-attract.md).

A job in Attract has job details, a hiring team, a hiring process, job postings, and analytics.

## Job details

The **Job details** tab contains details about the job's responsibilities and attributes. The fields for the job title, job description, and job location are required. The other fields are optional.

By default, the **Number of openings** field is set to **1**. However, you can change the value. When an offer has been prepared for a job, the value of the **Number of openings available** field is decremented.

If position management has been turned on in the Admin Center, the **Update positions** lookup is available. This lookup reads the JobPosition entity in Common Data Service for Apps and returns a list of positions that can be selected for the job. If the number of positions that you select exceeds the number of open positions, you receive a warning. You also receive a warning if a position is used on multiple jobs.

> [!NOTE]
> Position management is available with the Comprehensive Hiring Add-on.

Depending on the settings in the Offer activity of the hiring process, a position number can be used twice in an offer. For more information, see [Hiring process](./activities-attract.md).

Attract includes a default set of **Skills**. These skills appear as suggestions as you type. You can add more skills by entering the new skill text in the field and then pressing Enter.

Attract includes a default set of **Job functions**. You can add up to three more job functions by entering the new job function in the field and then pressing Enter.

Attract includes a default set of **Company industry**. You can add up to three more company industries by entering the new company industry in the field and then pressing Enter.

## Hiring team

The **Hiring team** tab contains the list of individuals who will be involved in the job. When users are added to a hiring team, they must be assigned a role on the hiring team. The role determines the data that the users have access to and the notifications that they receive. The roles that can be selected are **Recruiter**, **Hiring manager**, **Delegate**, and **Interviewer**. For more information about role privileges, see the "Role management" document. Recruiters and hiring managers can appoint one or more delegates to work on their behalf. For more information about delegates, see [Security and role management in Attract](./security-attract.md).

The hiring team can be updated after the job is activated.

## Process

Default information about the hiring process is based on the process template that was selected when the job was created. If a specific template wasn't selected at that time, the default template is used. When you define the hiring process, you can add or remove various stages, except the Prospect, Application, and Offer stages. Although the Prospect stage can't be removed, it can be turned off. Within each stage, you can add or remove one or more predefined activities.

For more information about activities that can be added to the hiring process, see [Hiring process activities in Attract](./activities-attract.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The process hiring can't be updated after a job is activated.

## Postings

After a job is activated, it can be posted. Only recruiters and admins can post jobs. The job can be posted to either Talent Careers (a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent career site) or LinkedIn. The Attract team continually works to partner with job board aggregators. Therefore, this list will expand over time.

For more information about job postings, see [Career site functionality in Attract](./career-site.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The job posting functionality is available only with the Comprehensive Hiring Add-on for Attract.

Three things to note about job posting process to LinkedIn
1) It takes upto 24 hours for jobs posted to LinkedIn to show up for candidates in LinkedIn. This is due to batch data ingestion and posting process for LinkedIn jobs.
2) While posting jobs to LinkedIn, we pass on the Microsoft 365 Organation name against the job (Previously called Office 365). LinkedIn matches it to a company on LinkedIn and links the jobs to the company based on the organization name we pass. In case your job is listed against the wrong company on LinkedIn, please make sure that your Microsoft 365 Organization name to match the organization name on LinkedIn. Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more?view=o365-worldwide
If you have problems after this step as well, please contact LinkedIn support.
3) Jobs posted to LinkedIn are posted as "Limited Listings" jobs. <Link>. If you would like to promote jobs posted to LinkedIn from attract, you should work with LinkedIn and enable "Job Wrapping" <Link>



## Activate

After a job is activated, it can be posted, and prospects and applicants can be added to it. The option to add prospects to a job is set in the Prospect activity in the hiring process.

> [!NOTE]
> The process hiring can't be updated after a job is activated.

## Prospects and applicants

The option to add prospects to a job is set in the [Prospect activity](./activities-attract.md#prospect-activity) in the hiring process. This option should be set before you activate the job. After a job is activated, prospects and applicants can be added to it.

## Approvals

Attract jobs can be submitted for approval. Not all jobs require approval. The requirement is set at the template level. By default, approvals are turned off on the template. To set up approvals, go to a process template, and set the **Approval** field to Default. Then select that template when you create the job.

After a job is saved, it can be submitted for approval. The following table lists the statuses of a document that uses approvals.

| Status   | State                                                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Draft    | The job has been saved, but it hasn't been submitted to a workflow. |
| Pending  | The job has been submitted to approvers.                            |
| Approved | The job has been approved, but it hasn't been activated.            |
| Rejected | The job has been rejected, and it can't be activated.               |
| Active   | The job has been approved and activated.                            |

In the job list, you can filter on the job statuses.

Approvals can be sent to any Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user in the company. The approvals are sent in parallel to all the people who are listed as approvers. After a job is approved, it can be activated.

The people who are listed as approvers will receive a notification in Attract to inform them that they have an item to approve. An approval item will also appear in the **Assigned to you** section on the dashboard. After someone accepts or approves a job, the hiring team will receive a notification. Finally, the hiring team will receive a notification when the job is approved.
