   > [!NOTE]
   > You can only close a job as **Position filled** when at least one prospect has completed the Offer stage. If the job application doesn't have **Offer accepted** selected, or if the application doesn't display a status of **Accepted** in Offer, the **Position filled** option won't display in the **Reason** dropdown.
