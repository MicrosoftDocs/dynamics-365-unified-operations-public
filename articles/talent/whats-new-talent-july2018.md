# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent - Core HR (July 2018)

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent: Core HR.

## Power Apps personalization

Talent supports integration with the Microsoft Power Apps service. Power Apps lets both developers and non-technical users build custom business apps for mobile devices, tablets, and the web without having to write code. Apps that you, your organization, or the broader ecosystem develop by using Power Apps can then be embedded in the Talent client to augment the product's functionality. For example, you might build an app that supplements Talent with information that is retrieved from another system.

For more information, see [Embed Power Apps apps](../fin-and-ops/get-started/embed-power-apps.md).

## Ceridian payroll integration

Integration between Talent and Ceridian Dayforce is now available for the US, Canada, and Mexico. The integration uses broad categories of data. Here are some examples:

- Human resources data
- Compensation data
- Payroll data, such as pay cycles, pay periods, and earning codes
- Worker data

For more information, see [Configure the payroll integration between Talent and Dayforce](configure-payroll-integration.md).

## Worker tax regions have been expanded beyond the US

Support has been added for tax regions outside the United States. When tax regions are assigned to workers, they can drive tax calculations and can be used in integrations with external payroll solutions.

## The title field has been expanded in Talent

Titles have been expanded in this update. The field is now 65 characters. This change has been implemented everywhere that title is selected, such as workers, positions, and jobs.

## Benefit enrollment status report

Built-in reporting about open enrollment for benefits helps you easily understand where your employees are in the open enrollment process. You can learn how many employees have completed the process, are currently completing it, and haven't started it. Additionally, you can quickly view any issues that occur during employee enrollment and a full log of all employee submissions. Therefore, you can easily verify and audit employee submissions.
