# Choose a version of Attract

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

The version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract that is right for you depends on your organization's size and needs. The basic version of Attract provides a subset of functionality that is targeted at smaller teams or organizations where the hiring manager is the primary user. You can start to use the basic version of Attract with one or more licenses.

Attract with the Comprehensive Hiring Add-On is targeted at medium to large teams or organizations where the recruiter or talent specialist is the primary user. The Comprehensive Hiring Add-On requires that licenses be purchased through a [Microsoft Dynamics 365 partner](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/partners/find-a-partner/).

> [!NOTE]
> The Attract trial showcases Attract with the Comprehensive Hiring Add-On. This add-on provides comprehensive recruiting and hiring capabilities, such as the ability to post jobs to an Attract career site or an external recruiting site such as LinkedIn. If you choose the basic version of Attract, your subscription will include a subset of the capabilities that are provided in the trial version.

For more information about pricing and licensing, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).
