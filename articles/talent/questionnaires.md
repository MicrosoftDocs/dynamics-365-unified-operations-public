# Questionnaires

This topic provides general information about questionnaires, and links to more detailed information. A questionnaire is a set of questions that is used to collect information for various purposes. You can design, create, distribute, and complete questionnaires, and then analyze the results. 

You can customize a questionnaire to fit your specific requirements by using various features that are available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise Edition. Here are some examples of how questionnaires can be used:

-   Test the professional skills of employees and applicants.
-   Evaluate whether course participants learned the course material.
-   Evaluate a course (for example, the facilities, content, and instructor).
-   Survey employee and customer satisfaction.
-   Evaluate employee job performance.

The following table provides links to information about the core questionnaire tasks. Click the links for more information.
