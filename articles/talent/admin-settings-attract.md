**Feature management**
----------------------

As new features are being added to Attract, they might be released within a
public preview. Public preview features do not meet all service requirements. By
allowing previews, you consent to share your data with external systems. Also,
new features may not be needed for your organization, such as position
management, you can turn released public preview features off and on depending on your
organization’s needs.

**Template management**
-----------------------

A Process template contains all of the activities that should be included as
part of a hiring process for a job. Organizations can choose whether to allow
team members to create hiring process templates in Attract or only allow the
Admin to create templates. Turn template management on to allow team members to
create their own hiring process templates. To learn more about process templates
see the [Process Templates in Attract](./process-templates-attract.md) topic.


**Email template settings**

In the Email template settings you can select a header image to be included within the email templates. The header selected will show on all email templates. Organizations can also add a link to their privacy and terms of use for communications to the footer of the template. This sections also allows organizations to create rich email templates for various outbound scenarios with placeholders.
To learn more, review the [Email Templates in Attract](./email-templates.md) topic.

**Offer Process**
---------------------------

You can configure the approval process for Offer within the Offer process
section. There is an option to require the offer to be approved before sending
to candidate. Also, when using approvals within offer, approvers can be required
to leave a comment with their offer decision.

There are two approval workflows to choose from in Offer; Parallel and
Sequential. Parallel sends the approval to all approvers at the same time.
Sequential routes the approval to approvers in a specific order.

Additional options to configure relate to the candidate experience.
Organizations can allow candidates to decline an offer without additional
discussion. If this option is set to No, candidates will not have access to the
decline offer button. If this option is set to yes, candidates can decline the
offer by picking the appropriate reason and selecting the decline button.

Lastly organizations can enforce offer expirations. If this is set to yes,
offers will expire based on the date selected below.

To learn more about offer management see the Offer Management topic.
