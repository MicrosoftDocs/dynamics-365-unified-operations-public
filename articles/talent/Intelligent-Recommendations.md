Intelligent Recommendations 
=============

Using machine learning, we are now able to help recruiters and hiring managers
identify top candidates for a position faster and help prospects find the
position that best suits their profile and interests. Users for these
recommendation features can provide feedback on individual recommendations and
help us provide better recommendations in the future.

Candidate Recommendations
-------------------------

Job postings can often attract hundreds of applicants, which poses a challenge
for recruiters and hiring managers as they have to be able to sift through the
noise and find the candidates whose skills and background are the best match for
the position. We are now able to use machine leaning to help the recruiter and
hiring manager identify the top talent to move to the interview stage faster by
intelligently analyzing the correlation between the job description and
requirements and the candidate’s resume and profile data. For any job, if you
have more than 10 candidates or prospects with resumes or complete profiles, we
are able to surface those which most closely fulfil the requirements of the job.
These candidates will appear under the **Applicants to consider** section on the
Job page.

For a recommended candidate, you can click **View Candidate** to review their
profile and take action on their application. You can also use the ellipsis menu
to provide feedback about that recommendation to help fine tune the
recommendation engine, or open the candidate’s profile in a new tab. Any
recommendations that you dislike will be removed from the section upon
refreshing the page. The feedback card allows you to indicate specific reasons
as to why you may not have found a recommendation useful.

Job Recommendations 
--------------------

When candidates use the career site to apply to a job, we are able to recommend
other open positions at the organization to them based on their past
application(s) and their resume or candidate profile. This helps prospects find
the best fit for themselves. We begin to make job recommendations to prospects
once there are more than 10 jobs posted on the career site. Prospects are able
to navigate to the details of the job posting using the recommendation card and
are also able to provide feedback about the recommendation to help improve
future recommendations.

Note: In order to enable the candidate recommendation and job recommendation
features, the preview toggle for these features need to be turned on by an
Administrator. This can be done through the Admin Center, under the Feature
Management section. Please ensure both the master toggle for Preview Features
and the individual toggles for Candidate recommendation and Job recommendation
are turned on.
