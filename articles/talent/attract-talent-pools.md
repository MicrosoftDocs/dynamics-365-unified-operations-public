Sourcing with Talent Pools
=========================

Recruiters and hiring managers can organize their candidates using the **Talent pools**
capability. There are hundreds to thousands of candidates who are applying for
jobs at your organization, the ones who are being sourced, you never want these
candidates to be lost amongst these numbers. This is where these talent pools
can come in handy to keep track and engage with all the talent.

Create and share a Talent Pool
------------------------------

Any user with Recruiter, Hiring manager or Admin role can create talent
pools. The owner of the talent pool can also share this pool with other users.
This helps groups of users, especially recruiters, look at a common pool of
candidates. Contributors to a talent pool can view the list of candidates in a
pool and also be able to add or delete other candidates to the pool. Below are the steps to
create and share a Talent pool.

1.  From the Attract home page, click on the **Talent Pools** tab in the left
    navigation panel.

2.  You will see **My talent pools** which shows you all the Talent Pools that you
    have access to including details like the owner of each of those pools and how many
    candidates are part of each pool.

3.  Click the **+ New** button on top right which will bring up the create talent
    pool modal experience

4.  Enter a unique name for the Talent Pool.

5.  If you wish to add contributors for this pool, find them
    using the people picker and add them to the list. 
    
    [!NOTE] You can only share this talent pool with those users who have a recruiter, hiring manager
    or the AttractAdmin role.

6.  Click “Add” to create the Talent Pool.

7.  If you wish to add contributors to an existing Talent Pool that you own,
    click the **…** on top right of the talent pool card on the **My talent pools**
    tab and click Edit.

8.  You can add users using the same people picker as step 5.

9.  If you wish to remove a user from having access to this Talent Pool, select the **Edit** button under the **...** against 
    the talent pool, select the **Manage access** tab under and click the trash-can icon to remove any user.
