# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (October 1, 2019)

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Changes in Attract

## Changes in Onboard

## Changes in Core HR

Changes described in this section apply to build number 8.1.2509. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to support numbers in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Streamlined employee entry and navigation

This functionality is now available in all environments. To turn this feature on, navigate to **System administration > Links > Setup > System parameters > Preview features**. Select **Enhanced worker form and navigation**. This enables these changes for all users. You can turn this option off at any time.

For more information, see [Streamlined employee entry and navigation](./streamlined-employee-entry.md). To watch a video of these changes, see [Dynamics 365 for Talent 2019 release wave 2 overview](https://aka.ms/ROGT19RW2ROV).

### You can enable preview features in Sandbox and Trial environments

When you provision a new instance of Talent, you can specify whether the instance type is Production or Sandbox. Instances of the Sandbox type allow for early trial of new features. If you want one of your existing instances to be updated to the Sandbox instance type, contact Support to initiate the change request.

For more information about how changes are published, see [Provision Talent](./provisioning-talent.md).
