[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Use the following information to help troubleshoot issues that you might have when you try to post jobs to LinkedIn from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract.

## You can't sign in to LinkedIn from Attract

If you're having trouble signing in to LinkedIn from Attract, try these steps:

1. Verify that the LinkedIn credentials that you entered in Attract are valid and correct.
2. If the credentials are valid and correct, contact [LinkedIn support](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin).
3. If the issue persists, contact [Microsoft support](./talent-support.md).

## Job posts from Attract don't appear on LinkedIn

If your job hasn't appeared on LinkedIn after 24 hours, try these steps:

1. Make sure that your LinkedIn Company ID maps to your LinkedIn company page and is correctly entered in the Attract Admin center. For more information about how to change LinkedIn settings in the Admin center, see [Set up integration with LinkedIn for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](attract-admin-linkedin.md). For more information about LinkedIn Company IDs, see [Associating your LinkedIn Company ID with the LinkedIn Job Board - Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/98972).
2. Check the job details on LinkedIn to make sure that the address is complete. To post a job successfully, LinkedIn needs at least the city and country or region of the job.
3. Make sure that the job doesn't duplicate another job that has been posted on LinkedIn. LinkedIn won't post jobs that are duplicates of either LinkedIn Premium Job Slots or Limited Listings from another source. Verify that another person at your company didn't already post the job manually.
