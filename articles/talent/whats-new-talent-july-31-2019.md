## Changes in Core HR

### Region support for Canada and Southeast Asia

We are pleased to announce that Canada and Southeast Asia regions will be available for Talent on August 1, 2019. With this change, you can create environments in the Canadian and Asian regions, and all Talent data will be maintained solely within those locations. You can create an environment in these new regions by selecting the location in the New Environment dialog and use that environment to provision Talent in LCS as described in [Provision Talent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/provisioning-talent).

Data migration of existing projects from other regions to the Canadian and Asian regions is not supported. Only new projects can be provisioned to these new supported regions.

### New Active positions list page

The options for position-based lists now include: **All positions**, **Active positions**, **Open positions**, and **Inactive positions**. The new **Active positions** list page displays only those positions, open or filled, that are active as of the current date. 

### Allow course participants to be added to open courses

This week's changes correct an issue where only direct reports can be registered for open courses.

### FTE Analysis displaying incorrect FTE number

**FTE analysis** has been corrected on the **Analytics** tab for **Personnel management**.

### Final comments label translation

The **Final comments** label is now translated in the review form.

## In preview

### Preview features are enabled only in sandbox instances

When you provision a new instance of Talent, you can specify whether the instance type is **Production** or **Sandbox**. Instances of the **Sandbox** type allow for early testing of new features. All existing Talent instances will be updated to the **Production** instance type. If you want one of your existing instances to be updated to the **Sandbox** instance type, contact [Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/talent-support) to initiate the change request.

For more information about how changes are published, see [Provision Talent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/provisioning-talent).

### View extended information for performance in manager self-service

A new option will let managers view the performance of both their direct reports and their extended reports. Currently, line managers can assign and update performance goals and issue new reviews. In addition, direct managers and their employees can maintain and update performance journals to help ensure that the performance review process goes smoothly. When this change is implemented, managers will be able to view and maintain performance-related information for their extended reports in addition to their direct reports.
