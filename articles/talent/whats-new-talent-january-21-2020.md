This article describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Changes in Attract

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract. We've added functionality to Attract to support our recent announcement, [Building a more successful workforce with Dynamics 365 Human Resources](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/12/06/building-a-more-successful-workforce-with-dynamics-365-human-resources/).

### Download environment data

Administrators can download their environmentâ€™s data. The data is exported in standard JSON format with all the jobs, candidates, and configuration exported in a zip file. For more information, see [Export data from Attract and Onboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/talent/attract-onboard-export-data).

### Restricting access to environments for non-admin users

Administrators can now restrict access to the environment for non-admin users. This action can't be undone. For more information, see [Restrict access to Attract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/talent/attract-onboard-export-data#restrict-access-to-attract).

## Changes in Onboard

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard.

### Exporting onboarding guides

Users can now export all of their onboarding guides and onboarding templates in Word document format. For more information, see [Export data from Attract and Onboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/talent/attract-onboard-export-data).

## Changes in Core HR

Changes described in this section apply to build number 8.1.2726. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to support numbers in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Most recent annual compensation field in Verify employment form isn't consistent (392092)

This release includes a change that will consistently display the latest currency based on the company selector on the **Verify employment** form.

### Known as field added to the Feedback recipient lookup (407789)

When providing performance feedback, the lookup for workers didn't provide enough information to determine if feedback is going to the correct person. We added a **Known as** column to help identify the unique name of the employee.
 
### HcmWorkerPayrollInfo record is created without an association to a worker (394526)

This release includes a change to not write HCMWorkerPayrollInfo records without reference to an employee.

### Able to edit department when navigating from position hierarchy (341001)

When security has been set up to deny access to editing departments, editing is disabled when navigating to the **Departments** form in all scenarios.

## Coming soon
