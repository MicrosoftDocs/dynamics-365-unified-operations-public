# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (August 13, 2019)

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Changes in Attract
This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract.

## Changes in Onboard

## Changes in Core HR

## In Preview

### Preview features are enabled only in sandbox instances

When you provision a new instance of Talent, you can specify whether the instance type is **Production** or **Sandbox**. Instances of the **Sandbox** type allow for early testing of new features. All existing Talent instances will be updated to the **Production** instance type. If you want one of your existing instances to be updated to the **Sandbox** instance type, contact [Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/talent-support) to initiate the change request.

For more information about how changes are published, see [Provision Talent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/provisioning-talent).

### View extended information for performance in manager self-service

A new option will let managers view the performance of both their direct reports and their extended reports. Currently, line managers can assign and update performance goals and issue new reviews. In addition, direct managers and their employees can maintain and update performance journals to help ensure that the performance review process goes smoothly. When this change is implemented, managers will be able to view and maintain performance-related information for their extended reports in addition to their direct reports.

## Coming Soon

### Platform update 29 for Finance and Operations

For more details about Platform update 29 for Finance and Operations see [Preview features in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations platform update 29 (October 2019)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/whats-new-platform-update-29).

### Streamlined employee entry and navigation

Changes to employee records rarely take effect immediately. You need to update data as of the employee's start date, which is often in the future, and you also need to update information in the past. With this streamlined navigation model, you'll be able to update future and past data without navigating to multiple forms or changing the date context. This change also dynamically promotes and displays key information in the upper banner area of the employee record.
