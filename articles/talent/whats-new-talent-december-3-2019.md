# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (December 3, 2019)

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Changes in Attract

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract.

## Changes in Onboard

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard.

## Changes in Core HR

Changes described in this section apply to build number 8.1.2646. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to support numbers in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Feature management workspace

The **Feature management** workspace provides a list of features delivered in each release. By default, new features are turned off. You can use the workspace to turn them on and view the documentation for them. For more information about Feature management, see [Feature management overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview).

All new features remain in preview for at least 30 days, and typically 30-60 days. Major features are generally available in October and April of each year following the preview period. As soon as you see new capabilities in the **Feature management** workspace, you can turn them on. Some features may be on by default.
 
At times, an integral feature will be on by default and can't be turned off (for example, the **Feature management** workspace).
 
Once a feature is generally available, it may be turned on or off in production environments. The **Feature management** workspace indicates when a preview feature will become mandatory. This date is usually on October 1 or April 1 to align with the semiannual release plans. You can't turn off mandatory features. Until it becomes mandatory, you can turn a feature on and off in all environments.

### Add automatic scheduling of Batch Job History cleanup (332528)

With this change, **Batch Job History** runs each night and removes batch job history items older than 30 days.

### Talent doesn't respond in worker actions when identification number length doesn't match the identification type (390971)

This release corrects the issue surfaced when the identification number length doesn't match the definition within the identification type. 

### Fixed compensation doesn't update level with changes to position details  (348085)

In this week's release, **Compensation start date** determines the job associated with the position at that point in time when creating a new fixed compensation record for an employee.

### Workers, Employees, and Contractors lists show Worker Type as Both when they should only be Worker or Contractor (384473)

This change accurately reflects the type of worker entered (contractor or employee).

### Email notifications for new hire actions don't contain name information due to security policies (383402)

This change corrects the information displayed in the first or surname fields within the placeholders for workflow when advanced security is enabled.

### System allows two full-day leave requests for the same day (379284)

With this change, you can't issue two leave requests for the same day. 

### Address changes list should be sorted by Effective date (352798)

With this change, the address change list is now sorted by **Effective date**.

### Leave requests should allow deletes from Common Data Service to Talent (376999)

With this change, draft and canceled leave requests can be deleted from Common Data Service and then removed from Talent.

### Delete earning codes is allowed when the same earning code is assigned to an employee (371792)

In this release, you must first remove the earning code from the employee before deleting the earning code from the system.

### Leave and Absence workflow with two approval stages fails to complete  (391116)

### Issue date doesn't sync to Common Data Service when updated or entered in Talent (397361)
