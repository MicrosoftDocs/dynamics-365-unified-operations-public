## Changes in Attract

Approvals appear in an **Approvals** section on the dashboard. Approvers can review their approvals under **Assigned to you**, which shows the job ID, the job title, other approvers, and the date when the job was assigned. Users who submit a job for approval can review their jobs under **Requested by you**, which shows the approvers who must still approve the submitted job.

### Platform update 28 for Finance and Operations

For more details about Platform update 28 for Finance and Operations, see [Preview features in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations platform update 28 (July 2019)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/whats-new-platform-update-28).

### Entity support for custom fields in Common Data Service

- **Compensation fixed plan**

- **Compensation reference point set up line**
- **Payroll earning code**
- **Pay period**
- **Fixed compensation event**

To view all updated entities in Talent:

2. Select the **CDS entity name** drop-down menu. All entities listed are on the latest version. 

###  Full name added to Worker entity in Common Data Service

The **Full name** field has been added to the **Worker** entity.

### Full-time equivalent higher than 1.0

A warning now displays if a value greater than 1.0 is entered for a full-time employee on a position. 

### A warning no longer displays on the Worker page when there is no future dated employment

You will no longer receive a message indicating that a future employment exists when navigating to the **Worker** page from the **Exiting employees** list in the **Personnel management** workspace. 

### Unable to delete a business process in Talent

You can now delete business processes in the **Business process** workspace.

### Leave balance no longer displays zero for plans with no accruals when using Balance as of accrual period

Plans that are set up with no accruals can now show a balance.

## In preview

### Preview features are enabled only in sandbox instances

When you provision a new instance of Talent, you can specify whether the instance type is **Production** or **Sandbox**. Instances of the **Sandbox** type allow for early testing of new features. All existing Talent instances will be updated to the **Production** instance type. If you want one of your existing instances to be updated to the **Sandbox** instance type, contact [Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/talent-support) to initiate the change request.

For more information about how changes are published, see [Provision Talent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/provisioning-talent).

### Restrict leave types in time-off requests

Organizations can offer many different types of leave to employees. However, it might not be appropriate for employees to submit time-off requests for some leave types. Those leave types might be managed by HR instead. In this release, you can configure which leave types employees can submit time-off requests for. 

## Coming soon in Core HR

### View extended information for performance in manager self-service

A new option will let managers view the performance of both their direct reports and their extended reports. Currently, line managers can assign and update performance goals and issue new reviews, which their employees co-manage. In addition, direct managers and their employees can maintain and update performance journals to help ensure that the performance review process goes smoothly. When this change is implemented, managers will be able to view and maintain performance-related information for their extended reports in addition to their direct reports. 

### Entities supporting custom fields

The following entities will be enabled for custom fields in Common Data Service: 

- **Leave type**
- **Worker bank account**
- **Work calendar**
