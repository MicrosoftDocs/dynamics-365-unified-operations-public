Talent includes Attract, which can help you identify, interview, and hire candidates that hold the skills your organization needs. As you move from recruiting through hiring, the Onboard app can help you bring your new employee into your organization by setting accurate expectations, providing information they need to get started, connecting them with colleagues, and set them up for success in their new role.
