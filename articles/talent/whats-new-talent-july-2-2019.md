# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (July 02, 2019)

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Changes in Attract

### Use organization service accounts to send e-mails

You can now configure email settings so that emails to candidates, interviewers, recruiters, and hiring managers are sent from your organization's email service account. For more information see [Connect an email service account](./attract-configure-email-settings.md#connect-an-email-service-account).

### Offer email templates 

You can now configure your organization's email templates for all stages during offer preparation, approval, and acceptance. Users can either use the default template or customize it before sending email. For more information, see [Configure email template settings](./attract-configure-email-settings.md#configure-email-template-settings).

### Candidate consent on Application

You can now enable the Terms and Conditions link for your organization. With this setting enabled, candidates must consent to the Terms and Conditions before submitting their job applications. 

### Coming soon in Attract
#### Job approvals appear on the home page

Approvals appear in an **Approvals** section on the dashboard. Approvers can review their approvals under **Assigned to you**, which shows the job ID, the job title, other approvers, and the date when the job was assigned. Users who submit a job for approval can review their jobs under **Requested by you**, which shows the approvers who must still approve the submitted job.
