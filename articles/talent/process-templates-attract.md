Creating a Process template in Attract
======================================

A **Process template** contains all the activities that should be included as
part of a hiring process for a job. This topic describes the elements of a
process template in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Attract and provides a guide on creating a template. 

**Using templates**
-------------------

Organizations can choose whether to allow team members to create hiring process
templates in Attract or only allow the Admin to create templates. To configure
**Template management**, navigate to **Admin Center** --> **Template management** Turn
Template management on to allow team members to create their own hiring process
templates.

[!NOTE] Creating templates is part of the Comprehensive Hiring Add-on for Attract. 

**Creating a process template**
-------------------------------

A template can be created by either an admin, recruiter or hiring manager. A
**Process template** consists of **Stages** and **Activities**. Stages group one
or more activities together. Every process template will have a **Prospect**,
**Application**, and **Offer** activity by default. The **Stages** that contain these
activities can be renamed. Additional stages can be added by selecting ‘+ New
Stage’. One or more activities can be added to a Stage by dragging and dropping
into the appropriate stage or by double clicking on the activity in the
Activities list. 

[!NOTE] Stage names are exposed to candidates in the application status page. Please consider this while choosing names for stages.

To learn more about the Activities, see [Hiring Process Activities in Attract](./activities-attract.md) topic.

**Default template**
--------------------

Only Admins can set the default template. Set the default template in **Admin Center** --> **Template management** and click on the ellipses of a template card. Select ‘Set as default’. The default template will be used if a template is not
selected when creating a job.

To create a template:

1.  Navigate to **Templates**

2.  Select **New**

3.  Enter in the **Template name** and select **Create.**

4.  Select **Default** in the **Choose the approval process** list to require
    Approval for a job.

5.  Select to enable or disable Prospects

7.  Add a new stage by selecting **+ New Stage**

8.  Remove a stage by hovering on the **Stage** and selecting the trash can icon
    that appears. Note: Prospect, Application and Offer stages cannot be removed
    but can be renamed.

9.  Add activities by dragging the **Activity** on the right and dropping in the
    appropriate stage OR by double clicking the activity and selecting which
    stage to put it in.

10. Remove activities by expanding the **Activity** and selecting the trash can
    icon on the activity header.
