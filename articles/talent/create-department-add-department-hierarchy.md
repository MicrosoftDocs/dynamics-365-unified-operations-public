# Create a department and associate it with the department hierarchy

[!include[banner](includes/banner.md)]


A department is an operating unit that represents a category or functional area of an organization. A department is responsible for a specific area of the organization, such as sales, accounting, or human resources. You can use departments to report on functional areas. Departments might have profit and loss responsibility.

A department might include a group of cost centers. Positions can be assigned to departments. To create a department, click **Human Resources** &gt; **Departments** &gt; **Department**. The following table describes the fields that are available.

| Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Department number   | A default value might be generated automatically if a number sequence code is assigned to the **Organization number** reference on the **Number sequences** page.                                                 |

To add a department to the department hierarchy, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Human Resources** &gt; **Departments** &gt; **Department hierarchy**.
2.  Click **Edit**, and then select the organization that the department should be under.
3.  Click **Insert**, and select **Department** in the list.
4.  In the list of departments that appears, select the department to add to the hierarchy.
5.  Save your changes. You receive a message that a draft version of the hierarchy has been created.
6.  When you're ready, click **Publish** in the hierarchy designer. You can enter an effective date that indicates when the hierarchy should be published. For example, to add a new department at the beginning of the next calendar year, set the effective date to January 1 of the new calendar year. The changes to the hierarchy will take effect on that date.
