# LinkedIn integration FAQ

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

LinkedIn is the world's largest online professional network. Microsoft Dynamics Talent: Attract integrates with LinkedIn to give you access to the world's top talent. Attract lets you post jobs directly to LinkedIn, and it also lets you draw candidate information from LinkedIn into Attract.

## For recruiters and hiring managers

Here are answers to frequently asked questions about how to use Attract and LinkedIn together.

- [Source candidates with LinkedIn Recruiter in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](./attract-linkedin-recruiter.md#export-linkedin-candidates-to-attract-with-one-click).
- [Set up integration with LinkedIn for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](./attract-admin-linkedin.md#set-up-apply-with-linkedin-in-attract).

### What do I need before I can post jobs to LinkedIn?

Your admin must [configure LinkedIn integration in Attract](./attract-admin-linkedin.md#configure-job-posting-to-linkedin). After that, you're ready to go.

### How do I post jobs to LinkedIn from Attract?

After you create a job in Attract, you just have to select the **Post Now** button that corresponds to LinkedIn. For more information, see [Post jobs to LinkedIn from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](./attract-post-jobs-to-linkedin.md#post-jobs-to-linkedin).

## For admins and developers

Here are answers to frequently asked questions about how to configure integration between Attract and LinkedIn.

### How do I configure Attract so that recruiters and hiring managers can post jobs to LinkedIn?

You can configure the available options on the **LinkedIn Integration** tab in the Admin center. For more information, see [Set up integration with LinkedIn for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](./attract-admin-linkedin.md).

### Can I export candidate information from LinkedIn?

Yes, but you must first configure integration with LinkedIn Recruiter. For more information, see [Set up integration with LinkedIn for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent - Attract](./attract-admin-linkedin.md).

### How can I post jobs to Premium Job Slots on LinkedIn?

Although Attract provides a powerful solution for posting jobs to LinkedIn, you might find that you need additional flexibility. For example, you might want to be able to post Premium Job Slots in addition to the free Limited Listings, or you might want LinkedIn to process your batch job posts more than once per day.

#### Types of LinkedIn job posts

LinkedIn offers the following types of job postings:

- **Limited Listing** – Free job postings that appear in search results when candidates search for jobs on LinkedIn and on a company's LinkedIn page. Limited Listings are targeted toward active job seekers. This type of listing is the type that Attract provides to LinkedIn. You can't promote Limited Listing jobs on LinkedIn. If you want to promote Limited Listings, you must work with LinkedIn to enable Job Wrapping. For more information about Job Wrapping, see [Limited Listings vs Premium Job Slots for Job Wrapping](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/79049/limited-listings-vs-premium-job-slots-for-job-wrapping) and [Job Wrapping Plus - FAQs](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/79050/job-wrapping-frequently-asked-questions).
- **Premium Job Slot** – Purchased postings that appear in various places across LinkedIn, such as the LinkedIn feed, emails, and the **Jobs You Might be Interested in** area. Premium Job Slots are targeted toward passive candidates, but they also appear in job searches.

Attract posts jobs to LinkedIn as Limited Listings. If you want to use Premium Job Slots, you must use Job Wrapping through LinkedIn Recruiter. Job Wrapping requires a job wrapping contract with LinkedIn. For more information, see [Job Wrapping through LinkedIn Recruiter - Overview](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/79037).

#### Frequency of batch processing on LinkedIn

LinkedIn processes job posts in a batch through Attract once per day. Therefore, it can take up to 48 hours for jobs to appear on LinkedIn after they are posted through Attract. If you need jobs to appear sooner on LinkedIn, or if you need any additional flexibility, you can use the Recruiter System Connect application programming interface (API) from LinkedIn. For more information, see [Recruiter System Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/linkedin/talent/recruiter-system-connect).
