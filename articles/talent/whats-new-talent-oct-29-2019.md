# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (October 29, 2019)

This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent.

## Changes in Attract

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract.

## Changes in Onboard

This release includes minor bug fixes for Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard.

## Changes in Core HR

Changes described in this section apply to build number 8.1.2586. The numbers in parentheses in some headings refer to support numbers in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Delete parties with no roles should be on by default (371233)

When you provision a new environment in Talent, **Delete parties if no roles exist** is turned on by default. When you delete a worker, the party associated with the worker is not removed unless this setting is on. This change limits duplicate records in the global address book when you need to import, change, or reimport workers.

### Draft and cancelled leave requests should be allowed to be deleted in Common Data Service (376999)

With this change, you can now delete leave requests with a status of **Draft** or **Cancelled** in Common Data Service.

### Additional list values in custom fields aren't reflected in Common Data Service after clicking Apply on the Custom fields form (379599)

When you add new list values to an existing custom field that has already synchronized with Common Data Service, they're now available in Common Data Serivce after you apply your changes in the **Custom fields** form.

### Apply onboarding checklists across legal entities when more than one employment exists (371270)

In this week's release, you can apply checklists to employees with more than one employment in **Worker form > Checklists**.

### Benefits open enrollment preview feature has been removed

In conjunction with our announcement in the [Strategic investments in core HR drive operational excellence](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/10/02/strategic-investments-in-core-hr-drive-operational-excellence) blog post, Microsoft has removed the benefits open enrollment feature from public preview. New functionality will be released in the future. Production use of the benefits open enrollment feature isn't be supported.

## Coming soon

### Print performance reviews

See [Print performance reviews](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-talent/print-performance-reviews) in the Dynamics 365: 2019 release wave 2 plan.

### Feature management workspace

Features are added and updated in every release. The feature management experience provides a workspace where you can view a list of features that have been delivered in each release. By default, new features are turned off. You can use the workspace to turn them on and view the documentation for them.

To learn more about the changes coming with feature management, see [Feature management overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview).
