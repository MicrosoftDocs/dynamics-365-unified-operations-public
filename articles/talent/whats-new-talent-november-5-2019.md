# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent (November 5, 2019)

## Changes in Attract

If you have another sandbox environment, you can also copy the database from that environment to a targeted sandbox environment. For more information, see:

### A position's Available for assignment date can be earlier than the Activation date (340103)

### Print performance reviews

### Feature management workspace

Features are added and updated in every release. The feature management experience provides a workspace where you can view a list of features that have been delivered in each release. By default, new features are turned off. You can use the workspace to turn them on and view the documentation for them.

To learn more about the changes coming with feature management, see [Feature management overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview).
