Business performance analytics lets you create or customize reports that include the data fields that you're interested in. You can also change any visuals on the reports. 

## Create a new report

To create a new report, follow these steps.

1. In business performance analytics, in the **Data explorer** section, go to **Reports**. 
2. Select one of the following options: 

    - **Start with a blank report** – Open a blank Microsoft Power BI embedded report that contains your Power BI dataset. You can then start to create the report. 
    - **Duplicate a Microsoft report** – Select a report in the list of reports that are available in business performance analytics. You can modify these reports as you require.

## Edit a report

After you open a report, you can edit the visuals or data fields by selecting **Edit**.

Reports of the **Microsoft** type can't be edited. You must duplicate them as described in the next section. You can then edit the duplicate report. 

## Duplicate a report

To duplicate a report that isn't currently open, follow these steps.

1. In business performance analytics, in the **Data explorer** section, go to **Reports**.
2. 2. Select the report to duplicate. (You can duplicate only one report at a time.)
3. Select **Duplicate**. The duplicate report becomes available on the **Reports** page. 

To duplicate a report that's currently open, select **Duplicate** on the report.

After the report is duplicated, you receive a "Report duplicated" message that contains a link to the duplicate report.

## Rename a report

To rename a report that isn't currently open, follow these steps.

1. In business performance analytics, in the **Data explorer** section, go to **Reports**.
2. Select the report to rename. (You can rename only one report at a time.)
3. Select **Rename**.
4. Enter a new name, and then save it.

To rename a report that's currently open, select **Rename** on the report.

## Delete a report

You can't delete reports of the **Microsoft** type. You can delete only reports of the **Custom** type. You can delete multiple reports at the same time.

To delete one or more reports, follow these steps.

1. In business performance analytics, in the **Data explorer** section, go to **Reports**.
2. Select the report or reports to delete.
3. Select **Delete**.
