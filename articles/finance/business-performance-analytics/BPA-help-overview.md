To maintain the accuracy of report data, business performance analytics assesses the quality of the source data. If the assessments don't meet defined rules, business performance analytics logs information in the `Transform Log` table in Microsoft Dataverse. This table provides insights into issues and helps you take appropriate action.

### Access the Transform Log table

To access the `Transform Log` table, follow these steps.

1. Open the [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/).
2. Go to **Tables** \> **All**.
3. Search for **Transform\ Log**.

### Understanding the Transform Log table
