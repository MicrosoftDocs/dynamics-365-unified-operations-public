## Included with Dynamics 365 Finance

Business performance analytics is an innovative reporting tool that is included as part of the Dynamics 365 Finance license. In addition to its comprehensive analytics capabilities, Business performance analytics uses shared Dataverse entitlements, including access to the data lake. Therefore, customers can seamlessly integrate and manage their data.

## Data reporting capacity

Customers who use Business performance analytics are currently entitled to report on up to eight quarters of data. The volume of data is also constrained by the storage capacity of the A3 SKU for Power BI Embedded. Customers that can't fit their data within the constraints of the Power BI A3 SKU should consider waiting for a future release, where additional data reporting capacity will be available. That future release will expand the data limits, so that larger data sets can be reported and analyzed.

## Data refresh frequency

Business performance analytics allows for two data refreshes per day, at 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM (Coordinated Universal Time). More frequent refreshes will be available in the future, to ensure that customers can work with the most up-to-date information to meet their reporting needs.
