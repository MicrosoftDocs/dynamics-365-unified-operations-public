## Turn data into action to improve business performance 

Finance departments are grappling with an array of data-related and tool-based difficulties that significantly hinder their productivity, accuracy, and capacity to lead strategic initiatives. They are saddled with outdated data and siloed tools that require slow and laborious manual processes to extract and integrate that data so that business insights can be generated.

After data is gathered, the analytical tools are often complex and require data science proficiencies. Alternatively, they are too simple and rigid, limited by outdated enterprise resource planning (ERP) interfaces and a lack of modern features such as machine learning and AI. These factors inhibit the discovery of valuable insights and opportunities to improve business performance. 

To support agile decision making, finance leaders must solve data challenges and ensure that robust and timely insights are readily available at the point of decision making to drive action. The purpose of business performance analytics is to help them achieve these goals.

### The transformative power of business performance analytics

Business performance analytics transforms how finance departments manage complex data and use it for informed decision making. Our solution helps Finance lay a foundation for the integration of AI and other advanced capabilities. The goal is to deliver an all-encompassing view of business processes and systems in real time, through easy-to-use tools. Customers can seamlessly consolidate data from Microsoft Dynamics 365, across Finance, Sales, Supply Chain Management, Human Resources, and Project Operations, and also from third-party ERP systems, P2P systems, and contracts. This integrated data model enables faster data updates and more automation. Therefore, it reduces manual tasks and IT dependence at the same time that it optimizes decision making processes.

### Impactful outcomes with advanced analytics

Business performance analytics lets finance teams easily access comprehensive and timely data. In this way, it streamlines routine financial reporting and task automation, and significantly reduces cycle times. Through streamlined data management and enhanced accessibility, finance teams can save significant time and unlock opportunities for increased automation, productivity, and accuracy. By taking advantage of their efficiency gains, they can shift their focus from their routine reporting to optimizing business models and planning for the future.
