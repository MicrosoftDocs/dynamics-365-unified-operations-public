A cost accounting ledger represents the overall reporting unit. It is defined by a cost element dimension, statistical dimension, fiscal calendar, and currency. It is agnostic to the concept of legal entities. A legal entity and its data can be associated with many cost accounting ledgers. This recording uses the USP2 demo data company.

1. Go to **Cost accounting > Ledger setup > Cost accounting ledgers**.
2. Click **New**.
3. In the **Name** field, type a value.
4. In the **Cost element dimension** field, enter or select a value.
5. In the **Fiscal calendar** field, enter or select a value.
6. In the **Accounting currency** field, enter or select a value.
7. In the **Exchange rate type** field, enter or select a value.
