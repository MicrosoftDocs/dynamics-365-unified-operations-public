# References to original invoices in credit notes

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


In some countries and regions, there is a legal requirement that printed credit notes include references to the original invoices. This topic explains how to set up and print the original invoice numbers in related credit notes.

## Prerequisites

- In the **Feature management** workspace, turn on the **Credit invoicing layout for sales and project invoice reports** feature. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).
- The printable formats of the required documents must be configured in Print management.

The functionality that is described in this topic applies to the following documents:

**Accounts receivable**

- Free text credit note
- Customer credit note

**Project management and accounting**

- Project credit note

## Configure Accounts receivable parameters

Follow these steps to set the parameter that controls whether references to the original invoices are printed in related credit notes.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.
2. On the **Updates** tab, on the **Invoice** FastTab, set the **Apply the credit invoicing layout into sales and project invoice reports** option to **Yes**.
