# References to original invoices in credit notes

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


In some countries and regions, there is a legal requirement that printed credit notes include references to the original invoices. This article explains how to set up and print the original invoice numbers in related credit notes.

## Prerequisites

- In the **Feature management** workspace, turn on the **Credit invoicing layout for sales and project invoice reports** feature. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).
- The printable formats of the required documents must be configured in Print management.

The functionality that is described in this article applies to the following documents:

**Accounts receivable**

- Free text credit note
- Customer credit note

**Project management and accounting**

- Project credit note

## Configure Accounts receivable parameters

Follow these steps to set the parameter that controls whether references to the original invoices are printed in related credit notes.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.
2. On the **Updates** tab, on the **Invoice** FastTab, set the **Apply the credit invoicing layout into sales and project invoice reports** option to **Yes**.

## Printing credit notes

When you print free text, customer, and project credit notes, they will include the reference to the original invoice and the correction reason.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that the printable formats of the documents are correctly configured, on the assumption that references to original invoices will be printed.

## References to original invoices in debit notes

By default, references to original invoices can be entered for credit notes. For example, you can enter references when you make negative (decreasing) corrections of original invoices.

To enter references when you make positive (increasing) corrections of original invoices, you must enable the **References to original invoices in debit notes** feature in the **Feature management** workspace.
