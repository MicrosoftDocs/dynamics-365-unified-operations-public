# Collections coordinator summary

Azure OpenAI services incorporates robust filters and safeguards to help prevent offensive, destructive, or abusive content from being created by using this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> The email is generated by using AI and Finance data, and the content is a suggestion. It's your responsibility to review and edit the suggested content to ensure that it's complete, accurate, and appropriate before you send the email.
