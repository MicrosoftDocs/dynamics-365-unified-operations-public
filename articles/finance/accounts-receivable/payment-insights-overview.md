This topic describes the payment insights capability that helps improve understanding of individual customers' typical payment practices and can identify circumstances that justify initiating collection processes earlier than you have done otherwise. 

## Overview

Organizations often find it challenging to predict when customers will pay their invoices. This lack of insight leads to less accurate cash flow forecasts, collections processes that start too late, and orders that are released to customers who may default on their payment. Customer payment insights (preview) helps organizations predict when a customer invoice will be paid, helping organization to create collections strategies to improve the probability of being paid on time. 

## Predictions

Payment predictions will enable organizations to improve their business processes by helping them easily identify the invoices that are likely to be paid late, and to take appropriate measures that improve their chances of getting paid on time.

Using a machine learning model which leverages historical invoices, payments and customer data, Customer payment insights (preview) more accurately predicts when a customer will pay an outstanding invoice.

For each open invoice, Customer payment insights (preview) predicts three payment probabilities:

-	Probability of payment being made on time 
-	Probability of payment being made late
-	Probability of payment being made very late

To help Organizations understand the total payment amount they can expect from a customer in one of the three buckets, On time, Late and Very late, Customer payment insights (Preview) also provides an aggregated view of expected payments.

Also, each invoice is assigned a probability of payment on time. If the probability of payment on time is less than 50%, the invoices are tagged with a red circle to  indicate that these invoices may require collections attention.

Customer Payment Insights (Preview) also provides contextual information to explain the prediction, for example, the top factors that influenced the predictions, the current state of business with the customer, and details about the historical customer payment behavior. 
In many businesses, collections has been a reactive process; the collections process doesn’t start until invoices come due. With 

Customer payment insights (Preview), organizations can be more proactive about collections. They no longer have to wait for the transactions to become due to start collections. Instead, they can use the payment prediction capability to determine whether proactive collections will improve the probability of being paid on time. Payment prediction also gives businesses the information need to justify starting the collection process early.
