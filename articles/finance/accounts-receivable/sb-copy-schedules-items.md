# Copy a billing schedule

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use the **Copy schedule** page to create a new billing schedule from an existing billing schedule. The new billing schedule will have the same settings as the original billing schedule. You can also use the page to copy items from one billing schedule to another.

## Copy a billing schedule

To copy a billing schedule, follow these steps.

1. On the **All billing schedules** or **Active billing schedules** list page, select an existing billing schedule.
2. On the **Billing schedule** tab, select **Copy schedule**.
3. In the **Customer account** field, select the customer account.
4. Update the billing start and end dates as required.
5. Update the values of the following optional fields as required: **End user account**, **Partner account**, **Customer reference**, **Customer requisition**, and **Deferral start date**.
6. Select **View preview** to view and select the billing schedule lines that you want to copy.
7. Select **Copy**.

After the copy process is completed, the new billing schedule appears at the bottom of the **All billing schedules** or **Active billing schedules** list page, and on the **Billing schedules** page.

## Copy items from one billing schedule to another
