# Create billing schedules

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

On the **Billing schedule** page, you can create, delete, or edit billing schedules. You can also review the list of billing schedules. When you create a billing schedule, the default values for it are determined by the billing group that is associated with it. Additional information is set up on the **Recurring contract billing parameters** page.

## Create a billing schedule

To create a billing schedule, follow these steps.

1. On the **Billing schedule** page, select **New**.
2. In the **Create billing schedule** dialog box, in the **Billing schedule group** field, select a billing schedule group.
3. In the **Customer account** field, select a customer account.
4. In the **Start date** field, select the start date, and then, in the **Number of periods** field, enter the number of periods. The **End date** field is updated based on the number of periods that you enter. If you update the **Billing end date** field, the **Number of periods** field is updated to **0** (zero).
5. Select **OK**.
6. On the **Billing schedule** page, in the **General** tab, in the **Description** field, enter a description of the billing schedule.
7. In the **Milestone template** field, select a milestone template for **Milestone billing**.

Fields such as **Invoice account** and **Currency code** are updated with information from the customer.

The **Billing frequency** and **Billing interval** fields are automatically set, based on the selected billing schedule group.

8. To create separate invoices, set the **Invoice separately** option to **Yes**.
9. To automatically renew a billing schedule after the final billing period, set the **Renew Automatically** option to **Yes**, and then set the **Lines to add per renewal** field.

The **Parameters** fields are automatically set, based on the values on the **Recurring contract billing parameters** page.

10. To prorate the amount of a billing schedule, set the **Prorate partial periods** option to **Yes**.
11. To align the billing schedule detail lines with the end of a month, set the **Align to month** option to **Yes**.
12. In the **Contract start date** and **Contract end date** fields, enter the start and end dates of the contract. These dates are for information only.

The **Payment** field shows the customer payment information from the customer. When a line item is on hold or terminated, the payment information can't be changed.

> [!NOTE]
> When you consolidate invoices by item, the value of the **Payment terms**, **Method**, and **Billing schedule** fields must match. Otherwise, the invoices can't be consolidated.

13. On the **Address** tab, you can review and update the **Delivery address** and **Bill to address** fields.
14. On the **Contact information** tab, you can associate an end user account with the billing schedule.
15. In the **Contact info** fields, you can enter a contact, email address, and internet address.
16. To track partner commission information, set the **Partner account** and **Partner commission rate** fields. These fields are for information only.
17. On the **Total** tab, you can view the various totals that have been calculated for the billing schedule.
18. On the **Hold** tab, you can view audit information about when the billing schedule was put on hold when the hold was removed.
19. On the **Termination** tab, you can view a history of the terminations that were applied to or removed from the billing schedule.
20. Select **Save**.
21. On the **Billing schedule lines** FastTab, select **Add line**.
22. In the **Item number** field, select the item number. If the item that is added is a parent item in a revenue split, the lines are automatically updated with the child items. You can edit only the parent item in a revenue split. All child items are then updated accordingly.
23. In the **Item type** field, select the item type.
24. Update the start and end dates.
25. Before the invoices are created, you can change the billing frequency by updating the **Billing frequency** field. After the first invoice for the billing schedule is created, the billing frequency can't be changed.
26. In the **Unit** field, select the unit of measure for the item.
27. In the **Pricing method** field, select the pricing method for the item.

The **Unit price** field is automatically set from inventory. However, you can update it if you change the pricing method to **Flat**.

## Remove a line item

To remove an item from a billing schedule, follow these steps.

1. On the **Billing schedule** page, in the **Schedule number** field, select the number of the billing schedule to edit.
2. On the **Billing schedule lines** FastTab, select the line to delete, and then select **Remove**.
