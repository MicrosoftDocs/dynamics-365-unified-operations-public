# Deferral schedules

Deferral schedules are created after a transaction has been posted.

You can use the **All deferral schedules** or **Active deferral schedules** page to review the details about a deferral schedule. The information that is shown depends on the type of deferral schedule (straight line or event-based) and the transaction type. It includes the deferral schedule lines and the total amounts for the deferral schedule. You can use the page to modify the deferral schedule.

## Recognize revenue

> [!NOTE]
> - To recognize revenue for one deferral schedule, start at step 1.
> - To recognize revenue for multiple schedules, start at step 2.

1. On the **All deferral schedules** page, in the **Schedule lines** grid, select the lines that you want to recognize, and then select **Recognize**.
2. On the **Recognition processing** page, set the **Recognition action** field to **Create recognition journal**.
3. In the **Cutoff date** field, select the cutoff date. The processing will include only lines where the end date is earlier than or the same as the selected cutoff date.
4. Select **Filter**, and add data filters so that the list shows only the range of records that you want.
5. Select **View preview** to view the lines.
6. In the list of lines, select any lines that you don't want to process, and then select **Remove**.
7. Select whether you want to summarize the recognition journal entry.
8. In the **Transaction date** section, you can override the transaction date with a specific date to process the transaction. The transaction date can be specified for closed periods.
9. To do the processing as part of a batch, select **Batch**. In the **Batch processing** dialog box, set the parameters for the batch, and then select **OK** to return to the **Recognition processing** page. The revenue recognition will be processed later, when the batch is processed.
10. Select **Process**. If you didn't add the transaction to a batch, all lines are immediately processed. Otherwise, the lines will be processed when the batch is processed.

## Modify a schedule

To modify a deferral schedule, follow these steps.

1. On the **All deferral schedules** page, select the deferral schedule, and then select **Accounting \> Modify schedule**.
2. On the **Modify schedule** page, edit the options that you want to change. Depending on the deferral schedule, you won't be able to edit all the options.
3. Select **Preview** to review the changes to the deferral schedule.
4. Select **OK**.

### Straight line deferral schedules

If the deferral schedule has no recognized or externally posted lines, you can modify the whole deferral schedule, including the start date.

If the deferral schedule has any recognized or externally posted lines, and you modify the deferral schedule, the resulting behavior of the deferral schedule depends on the recalculation date and the deferral end date of recognized lines. By default, the first period that wasn't recognized determines the deferral end date.

To use the date of recognition, select one of the following values in the **Start of schedule** field: 
- **Catch up** – The amount after all recognized lines are recalculated.
- **Reversal** – Any lines after the recalculation date are reversed by using the specified journal name and posting date. The amount after the recalculation date is then recalculated.

If a template is used, the skipped periods are ignored, and the template is used only to calculate the end date.

### Event-based deferral schedules

For an event based deferral schedule, you can modify all unrecognized lines.

If the deferral schedule has any recognized or externally posted lines, you can't modify the template and allocation type for the deferral schedule. When you modify an existing deferral schedule, you can't change the value of the **Create separate events per unit** field.

If a line is recognized or externally posted, the **Recognized** checkbox is selected.

## Modify a deferral or recognition account

To modify the deferral or recognition account for a deferral schedule, follow these steps.

1. On the **All deferral schedules** page, select the deferral schedule, and then select **Accounting \> Modify account**.
2. On the **Modify Account** page, select the account that you want to change (deferral, short-term, or recognition).
3. In the **New account** field, select the new account.
4. Select whether changes to the account create adjustment journal entries.
5. If you set the option to **Yes** in the previous step, select the journal name in the **Journal name** field, and specify the transaction date in the **Transaction date** field.
6. Select **OK**.

## Put a deferral schedule on hold

To put a deferral schedule on hold, follow these steps.

1. On the **All deferral schedules** page, select the deferral schedule, and then select **Hold \> Place hold**.
2. On the **Place hold** page, select whether you want to transfer the balance from the deferral account or the hold account.
3. If you selected to transfer the balance, select the journal name in the **Journal name** field, select the hold account in the **On hold account** field, and specify the transaction date in the **Transaction date** field.
4. Select **OK**.

To remove a deferral schedule from a hold, follow these steps.
