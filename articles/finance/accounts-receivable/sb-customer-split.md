# Customer split on billing schedules

On a billing schedule, the *invoice account* is the customer who receives the sales order invoice so that they can pay the bill. In some scenarios, more than one customer can pay an invoice. The **Customer split** functionality lets you add more customers that can be billed for the same billing schedule. To enable this functionality, go to **Subscription billing \> Recurring contract billing \> Setup \> Recurring contract billing parameters**, and set the **Customer split** option to **Yes**.

## Customer split on the billing schedule header

After a billing schedule is created, additional customers can be added to the billing schedule header.

To add a customer, follow these steps.

1. On the **Billing schedule** tab, select **Customer split**. The **Customer account** and **Customer account name** fields at the top specify the customer who is assigned as the **Billing schedule customer**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The customer account that you add can't be the same as the invoice account.

2. On the **Customer split lines** tab, select **Add line**.
3. Select a customer, and then enter the percentage of each invoice for that customer.
4. By default, the start and end dates of the billing schedule are used as the start and end dates. Enter different start and end dates if the new customer will pay the specified percentage for only a portion of the billing schedule. For example, if the billing schedule has a start date of January 1 and an end date of December 31, and the new customer is billed 40 percent for the first nine months, specify January 1 as the start date and September 30 as the end date, and enter **40.00** as the percentage.

You can add more than one customer to the customer split lines. In this case, the total percentage that is entered must not exceed 100 percent. Enter a customer reference and customer requisition as informational fields that will be shown on the sales order line during the **Generate invoice** process.

The line details will show the contact information, delivery address, bill-to address, and payment details of the added customers. This information will also be shown on the sales order for the customers.

When you add customer split information to the billing schedule header, if there are unbilled billing schedule lines on the billing schedule, you'll receive the following message that prompts you to roll down the changes: "Do you want to roll down the change from the header to the lines? Changes will only update the billing schedule lines that are not billed." Select **Yes** to update the customer split information on the billing schedule line. Changes won't be updated if the billing schedule line has already been billed.

If a billing schedule is created by using the **Copy schedule** option, default information will be entered on customer split header lines. It can't be the same as the customer account.

When the **Generate invoice** process is completed, multiple sales orders will be created. (Multiple sales invoices will also be created if automatic posting is used.) These sales orders and sales invoices can be viewed on the **Invoice** tab on the **Line details** FastTab of the **View billing detail** page. **Multiple** is shown on the billing detail line to indicate that multiple sales orders and sales invoices were created.

## Customer split on billing schedule lines

The customer split can be added to individual billing schedule lines if you want to split only specific billing schedule lines. Select the **Customer split** checkbox on the line, and then select **Customer split** on the menu for the billing schedule line to update or enter the customer split information.

The audit information is updated if the billing schedule has already been billed, but then the percentage was changed on the billing schedule line. Any lines that are billed after that change will use the new percentage.

> [!NOTE]
> - The customer split option can't be used with stocked products.
> - If the **Unbilled revenue** checkbox is selected, the **Customer split** checkbox can't be selected.
> - If you use **Revenue split only** option, the parent line has the **Customer split** option, but the child line items don't.
