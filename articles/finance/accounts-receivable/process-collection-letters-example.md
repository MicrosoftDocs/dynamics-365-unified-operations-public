# Process collection letters example

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic goes through an example that shows the process of creating, printing, and posting collection letters. The example is based on the **Ignore payments and credit memos when calculating collection letter code** option in Credit and collections. It uses data in the USMF demo company and a new customer, US-045.

To begin, go to **Accounts receivable \> Customers \> All customers**, select **New**, and then enter the required information to create customer US-045.

When you've finished, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Credit and collections \> Collection letter \> Setup collection letter sequence**, and set up the collection letter sequence as shown in the following table that is assigned to the customer posting profile.

|     Collection   letter code    	|     Description                       	|     Currency    	|     Main   account    	|     Fee   in currency    	|     Minimum   over    	|     Days   Block    	|
|---------------------------------	|---------------------------------------	|-----------------	|-----------------------	|--------------------------	|-----------------------	|---------------------	|
|     Collection   letter 1       	|     Second   notification with fee    	|     USD         	|                       	|     0.00                 	|     0.00              	|     2               	|
|     Collection   letter 2       	|     Second   notification with fee    	|     USC         	|     403150            	|     20.00                	|     10.00             	|     3               	|
|     Collection                  	|     Final   notification with fee     	|     USD         	|     403150            	|     50.00                	|     100.00            	|     15              	|

The following illustration shows the information that's in the table as it would appear on the **Collection letters** page.

    1. On the **Collections** tab, set the **Ignore payments and credit memos when calculating collection letter code** option to **Yes**.
    2. Make sure that the **Create collection letter per** field is set to **Customer**.

    5. In the **Unit price** field, enter **-100.00**.
    6. Select **Post**.

5. Repeat step 4, but enter **-200.00** in the **Unit price** field.

    You must now create collection letters for customer US-045.

7. Go to **Credit and collections \> Collection letter \> Create collection letters**, and follow these steps:

    5. Select **OK** to create collection letters.

8. Go to **Credit and collections \> Collection letter \> Review and process collection letters**, and follow these steps:

    1. Notice that the collection letter code on both the header and the transaction lines is **Collection letter 1**, because this collection letter is the first collection letter in the sequence. (To view the transaction lines, you might have to select the **Transactions** FastTab.)

   [![Verifying that the same collection letter code appears on the header and the lines.](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-4.PNG)](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-4.PNG)

    4. Select **OK**.
    5. Select **OK** to create collection letters.

10. Go to **Credit and collections \> Collection letter \> Review and process collection letters**, and follow these steps:

    1. Notice that the collection letter code on the header is **Collection letter 1**. However, the code on the transaction lines is **Collection letter 2**.

   [![Verifies that different collection letter codes appear on the header and the lines.](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-5.PNG)](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-5.PNG)

  The codes differ because the **Ignore payments and credit memos when calculating collection letter code** option is to **Yes**.

  2. Don't post this collection letter.

11. Go to **Credit and collections \> Setup \> Accounts receivable parameters**, and then, on the **Collections** tab, set the **Ignore payments and credit memos when calculating collection letter code** option to **No**.

    [![Setting the Ignore payments and credit memos when calculating collection letter code option to No.](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-6.PNG)](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-6.PNG)

    You must now create collection letters again for customer US-045.

12. Go to **Credit and collections \> Collection letter \> Create collection letters**, and follow these steps:

    1. Set the **Invoice** and **Credit note** options to **Yes**.

        By default, the **Collection letter** field should be set to **Collection per customer**.

    2. In the **Collection letter date** field, enter **1/23/2021**.

    [![Showing again that the same collection letter code appears on the header and the lines.](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-7.PNG)](./media/Ignore-payments-creditmemos-7.PNG)

    The same code appears in both places because the **Ignore payments and credit memos when calculating collection letter code** option is now set to **No**.
