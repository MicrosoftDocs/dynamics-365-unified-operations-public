# Milestone billing

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to define templates for the milestone billing functionality in Subscription billing. For each line in the milestone template, you can define the allocation percentage or amount. You can then assign the milestone template to billing schedule items that use the milestone billing functionality.

## Add a template

To add a milestone template, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Subscription billing \> Recurring contract billing \> Setup \> Milestone templates**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Milestone template** field, enter a unique identifier for the new template.
4. In the **Description** field, enter a description.
5. In the **Allocation method** field, select an allocation method.
6. Optional: In the **Total amount** field, specify the total amount for the template.
7. To add a line, select **Add**. Then, in the **Item number** field, select the item number for the new line.
8. Follow one of these steps, depending on the value that you selected in the **Allocation method** field:

    - If you selected **Percentage** as the allocation method, in the **Percentage** field, specify the allocation percentage for each line. If you specify percentages, the sum of percentages that is shown in the **Total percentage** field must equal **100**.
    - If you selected **Variable amount** as the allocation method, in the **Amount** field, specify the amount for each line.
    - If you selected **Equal amount** as the allocation method, you don't have to specify an amount. Each line will be updated with the correct percentage and amount, based on the number of items that are added to the template.

9. Select **Save**.

## Delete a template

To delete a milestone template, follow these steps.

1. Select one or more lines to delete, and then select **Delete**.
2. When you're prompted to confirm the action, select **Yes**.

## Milestone allocation

Before you start to use milestone functionality, you should complete these tasks.

1. Add one or more milestone templates.
2. Create a billing schedule group. Specify **Milestone** as the item type, and select a template.
3. On the **Item setup** page (**Subscription billing \> Recurring contract billing \> Setup \> Items**), select an item relation and a milestone template for the item setup.

After you've created the milestone templates, billing schedule groups, and items, you can create a billing schedule that uses the milestone functionality.

To set up a billing schedule that uses milestones, follow these steps.

1. From the **All/Active billing schedules** list on the **Billing schedules** page, select **New**.
2. On the **All billing schedules** page, create a new billing schedule, and specify a customer account and a start date.
3. In the **Billing schedule lines** section, select **Add line**. Then add an item number, and set the **Item type** field to **Milestone**.

    If a default milestone template is set up for the item, the milestone events are automatically added to the billing schedule lines. End dates are blank for milestone lines.

    If no milestone template is set up for the item, select **Milestone allocation**. Then, on the **Milestone allocation** page, select a milestone template, and make any required updates. Then select **Close** to return to the billing schedule, and finish creating the billing schedule.

4. To create invoices for the billing schedule, you must update the end date for each milestone event. For a single billing schedule, you can update the end date for the milestone event on the billing schedule lines. To update multiple billing schedules, select **Update completion date process**.
5. After the end date is updated, you can create the invoice. For a single billing schedule, select **Generate invoice** on the **All billing schedules** page. To create invoices for multiple billing schedules, select **Generate invoice** or **Generate invoice batch processing** under **Periodic tasks**.

## Edit milestone allocation on a billing schedule line

To edit milestone allocation on a billing schedule line, follow these steps.

1. On the **Billing schedules** page > **All or active billing schedules**, in the **Schedule number** field, select the schedule number of the billing schedule.
2. In the **Billing schedule lines** section, enter an item, specify **Milestone** as the item, and select **Milestone allocation**.
3. In the **Milestone template** field, select a milestone template.
4. Select **Process**. The milestone template lines are automatically added to the billing schedule lines.
