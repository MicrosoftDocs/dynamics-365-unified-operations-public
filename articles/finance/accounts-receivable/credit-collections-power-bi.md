# Credit and collections management Power BI content

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes what is included in the **Credit and collections management** Microsoft Power BI content. It explains how to access the Power BI reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.

## Overview

The **Credit and collections management** Power BI content was created for credit and collections managers, and collections clerks. It provides key credit and collections metrics, such as days sales outstanding, balance overdue, credit exposure, and customers that are over their credit limit. It uses transactional data, and provides aggregate views of credit and collections across all companies. It also provides a breakdown per company, customer group, and customer.

This Power BI content consists of 10 report pages:

- Two overview pages (one page for a credit overview and one page for a collections overview)
- Eight details pages that provide details of credit and collections metrics that are sliced and diced across various dimensions

All the amounts are shown in the system currency. You can set the system currency on the **Systems parameters** page.

By default, the credit and collections data for the current company is shown. To see the data across all companies, assign the **CustCollectionsBICrossCompany** duty to the role.

## Setup needed to view Power BI content

The following setup needs to be completed for data to display in **Customer credit and collections** Power BI visuals.

1. Go to **System administration > Setup > System Parameters** to set **System currency** and **System Exchange Rate**.
2. Go to **General Ledger > Setup > Ledger** and set **Accounting Currency** and **Exchange Rate Type**.
3. Define exchange rates between Transaction currencies and Accounting currency, Accounting currency and System currency. To do this, go to **General Ledger > Currencies > Currency exchange rates**.
4. Go to **System administration > Setup > Entity Store** to refresh the **CustCollectionsBIMeasurementsV2** aggregate measurement.

## Accessing the Power BI content

The **Credit and collections management** Power BI content is shown in the **Customer credit and collections** workspace.

## Reports that are included in the Power BI content

The **CustCollectionsBICrossCompany** Power BI content includes a report that consists of a set of metrics. These metrics are visualized as charts, tiles, and tables. The following table provides an overview of the visualizations in the **CustCollectionsBICrossCompany** Power BI content.
