This article explains how to set up and use the **Project subscription billing deferral cost of goods sold (COGS) adjustment (preview)** feature in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. 

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before using the project subscription billing deferral COGS adjustment feature, ensure your environment is updated to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.45 or later. This feature is currently available in preview and must be manually enabled using **Feature management**. For the feature to be enabled, the **Subscription billing deferral COGS adjustment** feature must also be enabled in Finance. If not, the project-specific version can't be activated. 

## Enable project subscription billing deferral COGS adjustment

To activate the feature, go to **Feature management** and enable **Project subscription billing deferral COGS adjustment (preview)** for project-based contract billing or sales orders. 
  
After the feature is enabled, COGS is automatically tracked and adjusted for applicable deferral schedules when related to project-based sales orders.

### Set parameters
To set the **Revenue and expense deferral** parameter, follow these steps:
1. Go to **Revenue and expense deferral parameters** > **Adjustment method**.
1. Select one of the following options: 
 - **Catch up** – The amount after all recognized lines are recalculated.
 - **Reversal** – Any lines after the recalculation date are reversed by using the specified journal name and posting date. The amount after the recalculation date is then recalculated.

### Initialize background automation
This feature introduces background automation to adjust COGS for deferral schedules in subscription billing. 

To ensure the feature operates as intended, initialize the background process automation.
1.	Go to **System administration** > **Setup** > **Process automations**.
1.	Select **Initialize process automations**.
1.	After initialization, verify that **Subscription billing deferral COGS adjustment (preview)** appears in the **Background processes** list.

When an inventory closing or recalculation process is triggered, the system completes the following tasks:
 - Identifies impacted consumption deferral schedules.
 - Updates the **Inventory cost adjustment** field in the COGS deferral schedule to reflect any change in the original inventory cost.
 - Executes the update asynchronously.

These adjustments ensure that any cost changes, even those changes that are made after the original posting, are accurately reflected in deferred COGS recognition.


### Example
If a sales order is created from a project for a stocked item, when the sales order is posted, the following are created: 
 - A revenue deferral schedule with **Recognition type** of **Credit**
 - A consumption deferral schedule (COGS) with **Recognition type** of **Debit**

After inventory closing or physical inventory adjustment is recalculated:
 - The deferred COGS is automatically recalculated.
 - The deferral schedule is updated with an **Inventory cost adjustment** amount in a consumption deferral schedule (COGS).
 - No new deferral schedule is created and the existing one is updated with the revised cost value.


### Audit trail update
A new line in the **Audit trail** is added to capture the inventory adjustment amount. 

#### Project posted transaction updates
To review the changes in posted transactions, follow these steps:
1. Go to **Project** > **Posted transactions**.
1. Select **View** > **View transaction**.
1. Go to the **Cost** section and verify that the **Deferral cost schedule number** is linked.
If inventory adjustments or closings take place, a new transaction line is added to reflect the updated cost. Importantly, no new deferral schedule is created and the original schedule is updated with the adjusted values.
