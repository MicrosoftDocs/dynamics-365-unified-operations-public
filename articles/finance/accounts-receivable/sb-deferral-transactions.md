# Deferral default transactions

This article describes the transactions that allow for revenue and expense deferrals. Deferral schedules are always based on and depend on an originating document or billing schedule. Deferral schedules are created based on defaults, and can't be entered or created separately.

## Sales order transaction deferral

Use the **Deferrals** or **Create credit note** page to enter or edit the deferral parameters for a sales order line.

> [!NOTE]
> When a sales order is created from a billing schedule, all values on the **Deferrals** or **Create credit note** page are read-only, and the deferral parameters can't be edited. To edit the values, use the **Modify schedule** page.

### Edit deferral options

To edit the deferral options for a line, follow these steps.

1. Create a sales order transaction.
2. Select the line, and then select **Deferrals**.
3. On the **Transaction deferral** page, the **Deferred** option must be set to **Yes**. Edit other fields as you require.
4. To preview the deferral schedule, select **Preview**.
5. If you made any changes to the transaction deferral, select **OK**, and return to the transaction page.
6. Commit and post the transaction.

After the transaction is posted, open the **All deferral schedules** page to view the deferral schedule.

### Create a credit note

To create a credit note, follow these steps.

1. Create a sales order transaction.
2. In the **Sales order lines** section, select the item that you want to create a credit note for.
3. Select **Sales order line** \> **New**, and then select **Credit note**.
4. Select **Deferrals**.
5. On the **Sales order transaction deferral** page, set the **Adjust existing schedule** option to **Yes** for the item.
6. In the **Adjusted schedule** field, select the deferral schedule that you want to apply the credit note to.
7. Update the **Recalculate date** and **End date** fields as you require.
8. Select **OK**.
9. Finish posting the sales order transaction.

### Purchase orders and purchase invoices

If you want to use the deferral functionality for a purchase order, generate the invoice first. Then use the **Pending vendor invoices** page to edit or add deferral items. You can't edit or add deferrals directly on a purchase order.

1. Use the **Pending vendor invoices** page to enter a vendor invoice.

    When you enter a line, the deferral is automatically set for the item or procurement category that you select. This deferral is based on the deferral setup on the **Deferral defaults** page. The deferrals can be edited or added at the distribution level.

3. On the purchasing line, select **Financials \> Distribute amounts**.
4. For each distribution amount, select **Deferrals**. When the invoice is posted, a deferral schedule is created for each distribution that a deferral is set for.

### Tax

In some cases, the tax amount can be fully or partially non-recoverable. If the tax amount of a deferrable line contains a non-recoverable amount, the non-recoverable tax amount is included in the deferrable schedule amount when the invoice is posted.

### Variance

If the amount on the vendor invoice line differs from the amount on the purchase order line, variance distributions are created. If the line is deferred, the ledger account for these distributions is set to the deferral account, and the amounts are included in the deferrable schedule amount when the invoice is posted. These distributions are named **Price variance** and **Cost variance**.

### General journals and invoice journals

Use the **Deferrals** page to enter the deferral parameters for a journal voucher line. You can also preview the deferral schedule for straight line deferrals. When you enter a line, the deferral is automatically set based on the setup of deferral accounts on the **Deferral defaults** page. You can manually change the deferral options for each line. When the journal voucher is posted, the deferral schedule is created.

#### Post and transfer

To post the journal voucher, use the **Post and transfer** command. The deferral options will follow the line that the voucher applies to. For vouchers that don't have errors, a deferral schedule is created if it's deferred. For a voucher that has an error and are transferred, any deferral options are also transferred with it.

#### Tax

In some cases, the tax amount can be fully or partially non-recoverable. If the tax amount of a deferrable line contains a non-recoverable amount, the non-recoverable tax amount is included in the deferrable schedule amount when the invoice is posted.

## Free text invoice transaction deferral

Use the **Deferrals** page to enter the deferral parameters for a free text invoice line distribution. When a distribution is entered, the deferral is automatically set based on the deferral settings on the **Deferral defaults** page.
