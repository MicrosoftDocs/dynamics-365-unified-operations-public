# Customer invoice logging framework for tracking sales order and free text invoice history in Dynamics 365 Finance

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and use the customer invoice logging framework to track sales order and free text invoice history in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. 

## Prerequisites

Before you use the **Customer invoice logging framework for sales order and free text invoice history tracking** feature, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
In Feature management, enable the **Customer invoice logging framework for sales order and FTI history tracking** feature. This feature introduces a structured logging framework to track the lifecycle of customer invoice documents, including sales orders and free text invoices. The logged data supports a detailed posting history in the **Customer invoice workspace**, improving traceability and diagnostics. 

## Parameters

To set up parameters, follow these steps: 
1.	Go to **Accounts receivable** > **Parameters** > **Updates** > **Data maintenance**.
2.	In the **Number of days to retain customer logging data** parameter, enter the number of days. The default value is 30 days. Organizations can use this field to set their own data retention policies. 
4.	You can set this value for a maximum period of up to 45 days.

## Data maintenance jobs 

Beginning with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.45, data maintenance jobs are automatically scheduled to run daily. 
These jobs automatically clean up customer data from the following logging tables: 
 - CustomerInvoiceDocumentLifecycleStageTransition
 - CustomerInvoiceDocumentLifecycleStageTransitionLog

By default, customer logging data from the past 30 days is retained. Older entries are deleted in small batches.

To schedule the data maintenance job, follow these steps:

1.	Go to **System administration** > **Periodic tasks** > **Data maintenance**.
The automatic data maintenance job helps prevent excessive growth of the logging tables. 

## Customer invoicing workspace

Previously, the **Customer invoicing workspace** provided a high-level overview showing the number of posted, open, and errored invoices. However, users couldn't drill down into the specifics of posted or errored invoices for further analysis.

With the introduction of the Customer invoice logging framework, the following enhancements are available:

 - The workspace now displays only two columns: **Posted** and **Error**.
 - Users can select the **Posted** or **Error** counts to access detailed information. For invoices with errors, an additional **Error details** tab is available, which shows specific error messages related to sales order or free text invoice posting failures.
 - The **Sales order posting history** and **Free text invoice posting history** tabs display data for the past 14 days by default.
