# Responsible AI FAQ for generative help and guidance in Business performance planning

## What is generative help and guidance?

Generative help and guidance is a Microsoft Copilot feature in Business performance planning. It provides a conversational interface where users can ask Copilot questions about the app. This feature is designed to help new users learn how to navigate the app. In addition, it helps experienced users stay up to date about new features.

## What sources does Copilot use to provide assistance?

The assistance that Copilot provides is based on the public documentation for Business performance planning that is available on Microsoft Learn. This documentation includes comprehensive details about the app, Business performance planning in general, Power BI visuals, the Excel add-in, and more.

## Is generative help and guidance available globally?

Currently, generative help and guidance is available in the United States in the English language.

## What should I do if the Copilot icon isn't visible in Business performance planning?

If the Copilot icon isn't visible, an administrator should review the following settings:

- In the Power Platform admin center, confirm that consent was given to the terms of use for agents and generative AI features.
- In the Power Platform admin center, confirm that the **Move data across regions** checkbox is selected in addition to the **Bing search** checkbox.
- In the Power Platform admin center, confirm that the **Allow users to analyze data using an AI-powered chat experience in canvas and model-driven apps** field is set to either **Default** or **On** for your environment.
- In the Power Apps maker portal, confirm that the **Copilot control** field is set to either **Default** or **On** for the Business performance app.

## How can users interact with Copilot?

Users can interact with Copilot in several ways:

- Select a prompt from the initial message in the chat.
- Select a prompt from the prompt guide near the text box at the bottom of the sidecar.
- Enter a text prompt in the text box at the bottom of the sidecar.

## What happens if a prompt is unrelated to Business performance planning?

Prompts that are unrelated to Business performance planning, or that have errors in spelling and grammar, don't receive an answer. Instead, they receive a default, fallback response.

## How can users provide feedback about Copilot's responses?

For each response, users can use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to provide feedback about whether the response is good or bad.
