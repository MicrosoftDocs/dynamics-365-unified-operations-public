# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance business performance planning requirements

This article describes the requirements for installing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance business performance planning.

## System requirements

Installation of business performance planning requires a Tier-2 environment (multi-box). For more information about environments, see [Environment planning](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/environment-planning.md).

Business performance planning is currently supported in the following geographies: Australia, Brazil, UK, USA, Europe, Canada, France, Germany, India, Norway, Switzerland, UAE, South America, South Africa, and Japan. Confirm that the environment where you plan to install business performance planning is in one of these geographies.

## Version requirements

Although Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.37 and Platform update (PU) 61 aren't required, they provide extra options for getting general ledger information into a balance format via process automations.

## Prerequisites

Before you can install business performance planning, the Microsoft Power Platform environment must be created.

Before you can use the functionality of business performance planning, a Finance premium license must be purchased and available on the tenant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't purchase a Finance license, business performance planning doesn't appear in Power Platform admin center as a Dynamics 365 app that you can install. To perform any planning operations, you must have a Finance premium license.

For more information about Finance licensing, see [Finance pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/finance/pricing/).

## Installation

To install business performance planning, you must install two main components.

1. Install the business performance planning app from Power Platform admin center. For more information, see [Install the business performance planning app](bpp-App-install.md).
1. Install the Power BI visuals from AppSource. For more information, see [Install business performance planning visuals](powerbi-visual-install.md).
