# Business performance planning custom visuals overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance Business performance planning offers a specialized toolkit of seven custom Power BI visuals that are tailored to your financial planning needs. These custom visuals provide a comprehensive range of tools that add planning and financial reporting functions to Power BI. In this way, they streamline what have traditionally been labor-intensive processes, and enable swift insights and informed decision-making. Through intuitive controls and powerful functionality, the visuals transform financial planning by promoting accuracy, efficiency, and agility. Therefore, you can focus on strategic analysis instead of data manipulation.

The Business performance planning application visuals are designed to work together cohesively to create a "flow of work" that empowers you to enforce controls and approval processes. In this way, you can standardize your planning processes across the enterprise.

All the planning and forecasting that you do in these visuals can be effortlessly written back to the planning apps data repository (Dataverse). This capability ensures seamless integration of your planning data between Power BI and the application.

## Matrix planning

The **Matrix planning** visual is the default visual in the Business performance planning application's toolkit of custom visuals. Use it to design comprehensive planning scenarios. After these scenarios are published, the interactive planning reports and dashboards enable exciting and powerful capabilities for Power BI users across your organization.

### Key features

- Enter data for planning or forecasting scenarios in a user-friendly tabular format, directly on the Power BI report page.
- When changes are made in Power BI, update data in the Business performance planning tables (Dataverse) through the write-back feature.
- Plan at any level of detail, and take advantage of the capability for drill-down into rows and columns together with top-down allocation capabilities.

## Graphical planning

The **Graphical planning** visual offers a dynamic approach to planning. It lets you interact with charts to fine-tune underlying values. As in the **Matrix planning** visual, you can create comprehensive plans through visual manipulation capabilities.

### Key features

- Do planning and write-back to Business performance planning Dataverse tables by dragging bar chart or line chart elements.
- Plan at any level of detail, and take advantage of drill-down and top-down allocation capabilities.
- The capability to enter data either as an absolute value or as a percentage of the total allows for a flexible planning approach.

## Reporting

The **Reporting** visual is your go-to solution for generating polished financial reports in Power BI. By using the advanced row and column formatting that this visual offers, you can easily create comprehensive financial statements, such as cash flow statements, income statements, and balance sheets.

### Key features

- Easily add subtotal and custom calculations anywhere on a report.
- Produce polished, professional-looking presentations by using enhanced capabilities to format the data on your reports.
- Include a view of variances on your reports to provide valuable insights into your financial data.

## Table edit

You can use the **Table edit** visual to edit dimensional tables directly in Power BI. In this way, you enhance the efficiency of business performance planning. This visual is designed to facilitate master data management and streamline workflows, so that financial planning is more agile and effective.

### Key features

- Easily create budget planning or forecasting scenarios and versions to facilitate an agile planning process.
- Effortlessly create, update, or delete data in dimensional tables through bulk editing capabilities. Therefore, this visual helps save time and reduce effort.
- Seamlessly adapt to your organizational workflows, such as designing and implementing standardized approval workflows.

## Variance

The **Variance** visual empowers you to enhance your variance analysis by offering customizable key performance indicator (KPI) cards and flexible visualization options. You can easily visualize variances through vertical or horizontal bar charts, and you can toggle between absolute, relative, and waterfall variance displays. Additionally, this visual allows for in-depth category drill-down and offers custom tooltips for comprehensive insights.

### Key features

- Visualize discrepancies between budget and actuals to provide a clear view of where discrepancies exist and facilitate informed decision-making.
- Dive deeper into your analysis through transaction-level details that are stored in a dedicated Power BI table and enable comprehensive investigation.
- Sorted bar charts quickly reveal key drivers behind variances. Therefore, they help with root cause analysis for future planning cycles.

## Copy

The **Copy** visual lets you effortlessly transfer baseline data, including actuals or forecasts, into new planning or forecasting scenarios. The flexibility to select the level of detail during the copy process allows for precise scenario creation. For example, you can easily copy data from previous year's actuals as the foundation for a new plan, regardless of whether it's a complete copy or has dimensional filters applied, so that data is copied only for a specific department or product.

### Key features

- Define specific dimension coordinates to copy and paste values from a source to a target. Therefore, this visual ensures consistency and accuracy during scenario creation.
- Create forecasts and budgets by building upon historical actuals. Therefore, this visual helps reduce redundancy and promote accuracy.
- Efficiently develop multiple forecast scenarios by building a base case and copying permutations as they're needed for comprehensive analysis.

## Comments

Use the **Comments** visual to collect comments directly from a Power BI report or comments that are entered in the **Matrix** visual. The **Comments** visual serves as your all-in-one solution for gathering comments and facilitating collaborative feedback during the planning process.

### Key features

- Capture and store comments directly in your planning process to ensure that all feedback is centralized and easily accessible.
- Help reviewers and approvers make faster decisions.
- This visual supports rich text formatting and embedded hyperlinks.
