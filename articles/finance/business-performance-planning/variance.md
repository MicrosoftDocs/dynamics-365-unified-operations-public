# Variance visual

This article describes how to use the **Variance** visual in the Business performance planning application. To fully use this application, you must also install Microsoft Power BI visuals. For information about how to install Power BI visuals, see [Power BI visuals](/power-bi/developer/visuals).

The **Variance** custom visual plays a pivotal role in budget variance analysis (BVA) by helping users understand and address discrepancies between budgets and actual results. This visual generates sorted bar charts that highlight the differences between two values to help identify the key drivers behind variances. Users can analyze root causes and refine future planning cycles by sorting the variances from largest to smallest.

The purpose of the **Variance** visual is to bridge the gap between budgeted and actual values, to facilitate root cause analysis and drive informed decision-making by presenting variances in a clear, sorted format.

## Benefits

- **Efficient root cause analysis** – The **Variance** visual quickly identifies and sorts the most significant discrepancies between budgets and actuals to facilitate prompt investigation into underlying causes.
- **Enhanced planning insights** – The **Variance** visual helps users understand discrepancies and therefore enables them to make informed adjustments for improved future planning cycles.

## Prerequisites and installation

For more information about prerequisites and installation, see [Install Power BI visuals](powerBI-visual-install.md).

## Use the Variance visual

The **Variance** visual lets you efficiently sort and visualize variances between budgeted and actual values. Therefore, it provides an intuitive and valuable tool during the reporting cycle. You can also render customizable key performance indicator (KPI) cards and visualize variances in vertical or horizontal bar charts. These charts support the display of small multiples, let you switch between absolute, relative, and waterfall variance displays according to International Business Communication Standards (IBCS) principles, and allow for category drill-down.

## Configuration options

In the visual fields, you can configure the value, the comparison value, and small multiples.

## Visual formatting

In the visual formatting properties, you can configure options such as colors for the chart, chart border, border color, chart background color, comparison bar color, formatting font size, KPI card features, and formatting of values. You can also specify which visual elements should be visible. For example, you can configure the total display in the upper right and specify whether users can switch between different variance types.

## Visualization and write-back

Users can change data in the underlying data source by dragging onto the bars.
