Asset leasing is an advanced module for managing, tracking and automating lessee financial transactions for leased assets in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. The asset leasing module complies with International accounting standards (IFRS 16) and US GAAP standards (ASC 842). The asset leasing module captures and processes main lease information and calculates journal entries for the lifecycle of the lease from initial recognition, monthly journal entries, to impairment and termination of the lease. The asset leasing module integrates seamlessly with fixed assets, accounts payable and general ledger.

> [!Note] 
> For more information regarding accounting standards, refer to the standard documentation of IFRS 16 and US GAAP ASC 842.
