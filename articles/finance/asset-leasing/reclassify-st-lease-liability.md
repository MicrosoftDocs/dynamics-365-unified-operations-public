# Reclassify the short-term portion of lease liability

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to create a monthly journal entry to reclassify a portion of the lease liability as short-term. When the schedule that is selected in the batch process is **Short-term lease liability reclass**, a journal entry is created. This entry is used to post the current portion of the lease liability on the last day of the month. At the same time, a reversal entry is posted as of the first day of the next month.

The short-term portion of the lease liability is shown on the liability amortization schedule. When the journal entry is posted, the **Liability reclass journal created** column becomes available, and the journal ID is also filled in on the schedule.

To create and post the short-term liability reclassification journal entry, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Asset leasing \> Periodic \> Batch journal creation**.
2. In the **Batch journal creation** dialog box, in the **Select schedule** field, select **Short-term lease liability reclass**.
3. In the **Lease group** field, select a lease group. Alternatively, in the **Book ID** field, select the book ID.
4. Turn on the **Post** parameter. Alternatively, if the entry should be created but not posted, leave this parameter turned off.
5. Turn on the **Preview before posting** parameter to view the entry before it's posted.
6. Select **OK**.
