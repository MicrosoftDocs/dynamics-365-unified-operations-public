## Asset movement
The Asset movement report serves as a rollforward report for the right-of-use asset balances for each lease. This report lets you view the asset transactions of a lease during a specified period. The report includes the following fields.

## Differences report
The Differences report shows the differences between information loaded into the Lease import framework and the information that's currently in the system. This lets you compare what was adjusted, updated, or added through the Lease import framework.  

The values in the report will vary based on the selected lease. The report will only show those fields that differ from what is currently in the system and what is in the staging tables. The old value is what is either currently in the system or what was previously in the system, depending on whether the import process has run. The new value shows the value that's in the staging table that will replace the old value.
