This article lists the help topics that are available for Asset leasing, and includes links to specific topics. 

Asset leasing is an advanced capability for managing, tracking, and automating financial transactions for leased assets in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. Asset leasing complies with International accounting standards (IFRS 16) and US GAAP standards (ASC 842). Asset leasing captures and processes information about the leases and helps generate journal entries throughout the lifecycle of the lease, from initial recognition, monthly journal entries, to impairment and termination of the lease.

Before you can use this feature, it must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the **Feature management** workspace to check the status of the feature and turn it on if it's required. In the **Feature management** workspace, find and select the feature that's named **Asset leasing**, and then click the **Enable now** button.
