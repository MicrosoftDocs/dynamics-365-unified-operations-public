# Set up lease books

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Lease books contain the accounting policies that determine how a lease is accounted for in the system. In addition to cash basis accounting, Asset leasing supports the following standards:

- Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (US GAAP)
- Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (ASC 842)
- ASC 840
- International Financial Reporting Standard 16 (IFRS 16)
- International Accounting Standard 17 (IAS 17)

To create a lease book, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Asset leasing \> Setup \> Lease books**.
2. Select **New** to add a book.
3. Set the following fields.

    | Name                                     | Description |
    |------------------------------------------|-------------|
    | Posting layer                            | Select the posting layer to use. Each book that is attached to a lease is set up for a specific posting layer. Each posting layer has different posting purposes. |
    | Lease type                               | Select whether the lease should be classified automatically, or whether it should be predefined as a finance or operating lease. |
    | Accounting framework                     | Select the framework that is associated with the book. |
    | Lease term/Useful life Set Up          | The system will classify the lease as a finance lease if the lease type is set to **Automatic**, and if the lease term over useful life of the asset is greater than or equal to the percentage entered in this field.  |
    | Present value / Asset fair value setup   | Enter a whole number to define the threshold that will determine the lease type. If the present value of future minimum lease payments is more than the user-defined value from the book setup, and if the book's lease classification is set to automatic, the system will classify the lease as a finance lease. |
    | Short-term threshold                     | Enter the number of months to use as a threshold for short-term leases. If the lease term is less than or equal to the number of months that you enter here, the system will classify the lease as a short-term lease, and the deferred rent treatment will be applied. |
    | Low value threshold                      | Enter an amount to use as a threshold for low-value leases. If the fair value of the asset is less than or equal or the value that you enter here, the system will classify the lease as a low-value lease, and the deferred rent treatment will be applied. |
    | Pay to vendor                            | Set this option to **Yes** to allow lease payments to be posted, as an invoice, to the vendor account that is specified on each lease. When a lease payment is posted, the vendor account will be credited. If this option is set to **No**, the account that is specified for the **Lease payment** posting type on the **Lease posting parameters** page will be credited instead. |
