## Set up sales tax codes

Set up sales tax codes by following the instructions in [Sales tax codes for VAT reporting](emea-vat-reporting.md#sales-tax-codes-for-vat-reporting) and [Sales tax overview](../general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.md).

## Set up the OB declaration

Note that "OB declaration" stands for "Omzetbelasting declaration" where Omzetbelasting is "sales tax" in Dutch language.

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Organizations \> Legal entities**.
2. On the **Legal entities** page, on the **Tax registration** FastTab, in the **Tax registration number** field, enter the tax registration number.
3. Select **Registration IDs**, and enter the same tax registration number. For more information about how to set up registration IDs, see [Registration IDs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations/blob/NL-VAT-declaration/articles/finance/localizations/emea-registration-ids.md).
4. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Index), in the Shared asset library, download the latest versions of the Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the following VAT declaration format:

-   OB declaration (NL)

   For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations/blob/NL-VAT-declaration/articles/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).
