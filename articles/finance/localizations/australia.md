## Low-value pool depreciation
Australia uses a low-value pool depreciation method that allows low-cost and low-value assets to be allocated to a low-value pool if the cost or opening adjustable value is less than a specified amount. For more information, see [Low-value pool depreciation](apac-aus-low-value-pool-depreciation.md).
