# Bank symbols for bank accounts

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Constant symbols are set up for bank accounts, and then used on sales orders, purchase orders, customer invoices, and free text invoices.

To set up a list of constant symbols for bank accounts, use the **Bank constant symbols** page (**Cash and bank management** \> **Setup** \> **Constant symbols**). By default, the constant symbol that you set up for a specific company bank account is copied to sales orders and free text invoices. It's then transferred from those business documents to customer invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, when you set up a constant symbol for a specific bank account, the symbol is copied to the **Vendor invoice printout** page. It's also shown on invoice printouts.
