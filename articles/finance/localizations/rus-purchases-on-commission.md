# Purchases on commission
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The principal engages the agent to find, in the agent's own name but at the principal's expense, a suitable supplier, and to agree on the supply of goods (works or services) to the principal.

Factures that an agent receives from a supplier have these characteristics:

- The agent must register them on the **Received** worksheet of the facture accounting journal.
- They don't have to be entered in the agent's purchase book, because the agent has no right to value-added tax (VAT) deduction.
- They must be copied, and the copies must be certified and given to the principal.
- The agent must reissue them to the principal.

Factures that an agent reissues have these characteristics:

- They must be registered on the **Issued** worksheet of the facture accounting journal.
- They donâ€™t have to be entered in the sales book because the agent has no obligation to charge VAT.

The following illustration shows the business process for registering intermediary deals. Rectangular elements are reflected in the system. Oval elements are present in the business process but aren't reflected in the system.
