# Unique certification

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In Italy, withholding tax agents must electronically communicate the Unique certification to the revenue agency to certify the following information:

- Income of dependent employments
- Self-employed income
- Commissions
- Other income

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met before the functionality can be used:

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.
- The **Unique certification** feature must be turned on in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Set up the Unique certification

### Set up a number sequence

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Ledger setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
2. On the **Number sequences** tab, in the **Unique certification Id** field, define a number sequence.

### Set up the unique certification values

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Withholding tax** \> **Set up unique certification values**
2. Specify the values for the **Unique certification** feature.

The **Set up unique certification values** page allows you to configure the values available for several fields:

- **record B**: Exceptional events
- **record D**: Exceptional events, special categories, and unified counties
- **record H**: Reason and code

The format of the telematics model of unique certification has been updated according to the new specifications in the regulatory update of Unique Certification, valid from March 7, 2018:

- **record A**: CUR18 supply code
- **record B**: New values for exceptional events
- **record D**: New values for exceptional events and special categories and the introduction of unified counties fields
- **record H**: New values for reason and code fields
- **record Z**: Count of L records to 0

Values that are specified on **Setup Unique Certification values** page, and marked with **Yes** in the **Active** column, will be available in the related lookup fields on the **Unique certification** page. Use this page for future regulatory upgrades of the unique certification to add or delete values.

You can import the initial set of values for **Setup Unique Certification values** by using the **Setup Unique certification values** (UniqueCertificationValueEntity) entity and the Data management framework. For more information, see [Data import and export jobs overview](../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md). You can download the initial set of values for the **Setup Unique Certification values** from the **IT SetupUniqueCertificationValues** file in the **Data package** asset data type section of the **Shared asset library** in the [LCS portal](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2) and then import it in to the Data management framework.

The source data used for import can be presented as a Microsoft Excel file that has the following column names:

- FIELD
- VALUE
- ACTIVE
- VALUEDESCRIPTION

### Set up a revenue typology for the Unique certification

You must set up a revenue typology in the **Revenue typology** field in the **Invoice and delivery** section on the **Vendors** page.

### Set up a format for the Unique certification

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Ledger setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
2. On the **Withholding tax** tab, in the **Unique Certification format mapping** field, define the Electronic reporting (ER) format that should be used to generate the Unique certification.

## Generate the Unique certification

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Declarations** \> **Withholding tax** \> **Unique Certification**.
2. Select **New**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The year before the year of the current system date is automatically assigned as the reporting year of the declaration.

3. In the **Title-page** section, enter the company information and the information about the person who is in charge of communicating the Unique certification to the revenue agency.
4. Select **Generate** to create the certifications for each recipient and to automatically fill in the other sections. The **Vendor** section contains the list of recipients (vendors) and the vendor details.
5. Select **Generate details** to enter the details of vendors transactions in the declaration.
6. The **Withholding tax** section shows the amounts of each vendor certification. The amounts are calculated and sorted by withholding tax code.

## Process the Unique certification

After the Unique certification is generated and filled with data, you can select **Validate** to validate the data before the output file is generated. After the output file is validated, select **Export** to generate the electronic output file in the legally required format.
