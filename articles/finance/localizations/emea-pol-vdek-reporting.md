[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The JPK-V7M reporting process is predefined by the data entities that are delivered in the PL JPK_V7M EM setup.zip package. The following illustration shows an overview of the process.

![JPK_V7M reporting process flow](media/vdek-em-processing.jpg)

The PL JPK_V7M EM setup.zip package provides a setup for the JPK-V7M processing that supports the process of JPK-V7M reporting. This setup consists of the following steps:

- **Tworzyć (Create):** Create an electronic message for JPK-V7M reporting.
- **Wygeneruj plik (Generate file):** Generate an XML file in JPK-V7M format.
- **Podgląd w programie Excel (Preview in Excel format):** Generate the JPK-V7M report in Microsoft Excel format for preview.
- **Zmień status (Change status):** Change the status of the electronic message.

## Initial assumptions for the JPK-V7M report

The implementation of the JPK-V7M report is based on the same set of sales tax reporting codes that were used in the JPK_VAT report. 
For more information, see [Generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf.md#generate-a-saf-vat-sales-and-purchase-register).

The following table shows the sales tax reporting codes that are used in the JPK_VAT report, and their mapping with **K_\*** elements of the JPK-V7M report.

You can prepare the JPK-V7M report for periods that are shorter than a full month. On the **Electronic messages** page (**Tax** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Electronic messages** > **Electronic messages**), use the **From date** and **To date** fields to define the date interval that you want to generate JPK-V7M report for. These dates must be in the same calendar month.

When you generate the JPK-V7M report in XML format for a period that is shorter than a full month, you receive a warning that the report is being generated for less than a full month, and that it can't be used for submission to the authority. The report will also contain the following information that indicates that it isn't for a full month:

- The **\<Miesiac\>** tag will contain information about the date interval that report is generated for.
- The **\<P_\*\>** tag of the **Deklaracja** part of the report contains calculated values that represent the aggregation of amounts from the **SprzedazWiersz** and **ZakupWiersz** parts of the report. The values in this tag will be rounded to a two-digit decimal value, not an integer value.
