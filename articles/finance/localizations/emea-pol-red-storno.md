# Activate storno accounting for Poland

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Use these procedures to set up storno accounting. In storno accounting, you reverse the sign on amounts to reverse incorrect original transactions. For example, the following transactions are incorrectly recorded.

|Description        | Debit |Credit  |
|-------------------|-------|--------|
|Sales revenue      |       |100.00  |
|Accounts receivable|100.00 |        |

To reverse the transactions and post the reversing transactions as storno transactions, you enter the following information.

|Description        | Debit  |Credit   |
|-------------------|--------|---------|
|Sales revenue      |        |-100.00  |
|Accounts receivable|-100.00 |         |

Each reversing transaction appears in the same debit or credit column as the original transaction. By keeping amounts in their original columns and reversing the sign on the amounts, you effectively “zero out” the original transaction.

After you complete the following procedure, a transaction is created that automatically reverses storno transactions.

## Activate storno accounting
You must activate storno accounting in General ledger before you can set up storno parameters in any other module.

1. Click **General ledger** > **Setup** > **General ledger parameters**.
2. In the **Ledger** area, on the **Accounting rules** FastTab, in the **Transaction reversal** field group, set the **Correction** option to **Yes**.

## Set up storno accounting
After you activate storno accounting, you can set up parameters in the application modules. The parameters that are specific to a module typically use storno accounting by default for various processes in the module. You can change the default setting when it appears on a page. However, the setting does not appear on all pages. Some pages always use the default setting during processing, and you cannot change the setting.

### Set up storno accounting in Accounts payable
On the  **Accounts payable parameters** page, in the **Invoice** area, set the **Credit note as correction** option to **Yes**. By default, credit notes are now posted as storno transactions.

1. Go to the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.
2. In the **Updates** area, in the **Advance invoice** field group, set the **Credit note as correction** option to **Yes**. By default, credit notes for advance invoices are now posted as storno transactions.
