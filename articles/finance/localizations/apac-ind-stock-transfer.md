# Stock transfer orders for India

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use transfer orders to process inventory transfers between warehouses. In India, if the shipping and receiving branches of the organization have different tax registration numbers, the India Goods and Services Tax (GST) should be calculated and posted for the transfer order. The tax base may be defined as the current cost price of the item being transferred or a special transfer price. The tax amount should be posted as GST payable for the transfer shipment and as GST recoverable upon the transfer receipt. An **Interim transit** account is used as an offset account for the posting and is nullified when the transfer order is fully received. 

The **Stock transfer** functionality that is available for India supports this process.

## Set up stock transfers

### Enable stock transfer functionality

Enable the following features in the **Feature management** workspace:

- (India) Improvements in unit price and cost price handling in Stock transfer orders
- (Stock transfer for India) Set up the default transfer type and price type for transfer orders created from Master planning
- Enable uniform tax amount and GST transaction ID for both shipment and receipt transaction of a stock transfer order

For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

You also need to configure the India GST functionality to enable GST calculation for stock transfer orders. For more information, see [India Goods and Services Tax (GST) overview](apac-ind-gst.md).   

### Set up default transfer type and price type for transfer orders

You can define a default transfer order type and a default price type for transfer orders that are created manually. On the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page, on the **Transfer orders** tab, select **Stock transfer** in the **Transfer type** field to enable the **Stock transfer** functionality for all newly created transfer orders.  In the **Price type** field, select a default price type for newly created stock transfer orders:

- **Cost price** – The cost price, or the on-hand price, of the item will be used for stock transfer orders.
- **Transfer price** – The transfer price that is set up for the item will be used for stock transfer orders.

### Configure Master planning parameters

You can define a default transfer order type and a default price type for transfer orders that are created when confirming planned orders in the **Master planning** module. On the **Master planning parameters** page, on the **Standard update** tab, select **Transfer type** and **Price type** in the **Firm - Transfer** group.

> [!NOTE]
> These parameters are only available if the "(Stock transfer for India) Set up the default transfer type and price type for transfer orders created from Master planning" feature is enabled in the **Feature management** workspace. Otherwise, default transfer type and price type are defined by corresponding parameters on the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page.

### Set up item master parameters

To calculate GST for an item in a stock transfer order, you need to configure certain parameters on the **Released product details** page, such as **HSN codes** and **Tax rate type**. For more information, see [Assign HSN codes and SACs to products](apac-ind-gst-hsn-service-accounting-codes.md#assign-hsn-codes-and-sacs-to-products).

### Configure transfer pricing

You can configure the prices that will be used when processing stock transfers for an item. To do this, open the **Transfer price** page from the **Released product details** page.

### Configure stock transfer posting

You must configure the **Interim transit** account, which is done on the following pages:

- In the **Inventory management** module, on the **Posting** page, on the **Transfer order** tab, specify the **Interim transit** account.
- On the **Tax setup** page, click **Setup**, and on the **Setup** page specify the **Interim transit for stock transfer** account for all GST components that may be created for GST on stock transfer. For more information, see [Define main accounts](apac-ind-gst-map-configuration-tax-types.md#define-main-accounts-1).

> [!NOTE]
> The accounts that are used to post interim transit amounts should have **Interim transit** specified in the **Posting type** field on the **Posting validation** tab of the **Main accounts** page.

You must also set up main accounts to post inventory cost for transfer orders to. Specify the following accounts from the **Inventory** tab on the **Posting** page in **Inventory management**: 

- **Inventory issue**
- **Inventory receipt**
- **Inter-unit payable**
- **Inter-unit receivable**
- **Inventory expenditure, loss**

> [!NOTE]
> The **Inventory expenditure, loss** account is required to post the scrap amount when receiving a transfer order with scrap.

## Create and post a stock transfer order

1. Go to **Inventory management** > **Outbound orders** > **Transfer order** and create a new transfer order.
2. In the **From warehouse** field, select the supply warehouse that the items are dispatched from.
3. In the **To warehouse** field, select the receiving warehouse that the items are delivered to.
4. In the **Transfer type** field, select **Stock transfer** to apply GST to the transfer of items.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select **Transfer order** in the **Transfer type** field, the transfer order will be posted based on the standard transfer order process.

1. In the **Price type** field, select a default price type for transfer order lines.
2. On the **Transfer order lines** tab, create a new line and in the **Item number** field, select the item to transfer.
3. In the **Transfer quantity** field, enter the quantity of the items to transfer, and in the **Unit** field, modify the default unit of measurement, if required.
4. In the **Price type** field, select the price type for the transfer order line, from the following options:
    
    - **Cost price** – The cost price, or the on-hand price, of the item is used for the transfer order line.
    - **Transfer price** – The transfer price that is set up for the item is used for the transfer order line.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Price type** is set to **Transfer price**, the quantity of the items that are defined for the combination of item and dimension on the **Transfer price** page is displayed in the **Transfer quantity** field, but it can be modified.

1. In the **Unit price** field, enter the cost price or the transfer price for one unit of the item.
2. Select the **Tax information** tab to set up taxes for the transfer order and enter details. You can change the default information that is displayed in the fields.
3. Select **Ship** > **Ship transfer order**, and on the **Shipment** page, post the transfer order shipment.
4. Select **Receive** > **Receive**, and on the **Receive** page, post the transfer order receipt.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the "Enable uniform tax amount and GST transaction ID for both shipment and receipt transaction of a stock transfer order" feature is enabled in the **Feature management** workspace, it is only possible to receive a previously posted shipment. You need to select **Shipment** in the **Update** field when posting a receipt and select a previously posted shipment in the **Shipment voucher** field.
    
You can also cancel a previously posted stock transfer order shipment if no receipts have been posted for this order. On the **Transfer orders** page, select **Transfer order** > **Transfer order history**. On the **Transfer order history** page, select a previously posted shipment. Select **Cancel**, and confirm the cancellation of the shipment. The shipment will be canceled, and all inventory movements and GST that was posted for the shipment will be reversed. The "Transfer Order Cancellation" feature in the **Feature management** workspace must be enabled to cancel transfer order shipments.
