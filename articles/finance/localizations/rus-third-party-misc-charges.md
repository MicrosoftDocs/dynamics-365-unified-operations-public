# Third party miscellaneous charges

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to handle services that are purchased though a separate invoice as miscellaneous charges. The cost of these services can be included in the cost price of the purchased goods or written off as a cost, like the miscellaneous charges that are defined in the invoice for the purchase of goods. Additionally, the debt on these services can be redrawn to third parties, such as customers or vendors. In this case, a facture is created that won't be included in the sales book or purchase book.

You must purchase an item of the **Service** type to do the accounting as a miscellaneous charge that you will allocate later. You must also specify item-related parameters for the miscellaneous charges code.

There are three modes of miscellaneous charges allocation:

 - **Include to the cost price** – Allocate miscellaneous charges to other item invoices, so that the allocations can be included in an item's cost price. The allocation base is the invoice lines. The allocation causes the item's cost to be adjusted.
 - **Redraw debt** – Allocate miscellaneous charges to redraw debt to third parties. The allocation base is the counteragent (customer or vendor) that the debt is reissued on. The allocation causes the system to create invoices for payment and factures for the selected counteragent.
 - **Write-off to cost** – Allocate miscellaneous charges to the ledger account. The allocation base is the ledger account. The allocation causes the charges amount to be written off to the selected account.
 
## Setup
### Set up a charges code

1. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Charges setup** > **Charges code**.
2. Select **New** to create a charges code.
3. In the **Charges code** field, enter a code for the charges.
4. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the charges.
5. Optional: In the **Item sales tax group** field, select an item sales tax group.
6. In the **Maximum amount** field, enter the maximum amount that is allowed for this charges code. This field is used to validate charges for vendor invoices.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To turn on the functionality for validating charges, on the **Accounts payable parameters** page, on the **Invoice         validation** tab, set the **Enable invoice matching validation** option to **Yes**.

7. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Debit** section, follow these steps:

      a. In the **Type** field, select **Ledger account** to post the purchased service as a miscellaneous charge.
      
    b. In the **Posting** field, select **Allocation** as the posting type for the debit account.
      
    c. In the **Account** field, select the account number that the amount on the purchase order or invoice journal line should be debited to.

### Create a released product for a service item

1. Go to **Product information management** > **Products** > **Released products** to open the **Released product details** page.
2. Create a product.
3. In the **Product type** field, select **Service**.

### Set up a sales tax group that has exempt tax codes
If you must redraw debt for services that are provided to a third party, you can create a facture for redrawn amounts that isn't reflected in the purchase book or sales book. Set up the sales tax group so that it has the sales tax codes, and make sure that the **Exempt** check boxes are selected. After you complete this setup, the system won't generate ledger transactions for tax. However, the appropriate tax rate must be specified for the sales tax codes, to help guarantee that the printed form of the reissued invoice will reflect the tax.

1. Go to **Tax** > **Sales tax** > **Sales tax** groups.
2. Create a sales tax group.
3. On the **Setup** FastTab, in the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax codes for all value-added tax (VAT) rates.
4. For each sales tax code, select the **Exempt** check box to indicate that sales tax isn't calculated.
5. Select **Save**.

### Define a transit tax group for a sales tax group
The transit tax group is used in the invoice that is created during the redraw debt transaction.

1. Go to **Tax** > **Sales tax** > **Sales tax groups**.
2. Create a sales tax group.
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Transit tax group** field, select the sales tax group that has an exempt tax code that is used to redraw the charges.
4. On the **Setup** FastTab, in the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code.
5. Select **Save**.

[![Sales tax groups with transit tax](./media/4-sales-tax-groups.jpg)](./media/4-sales-tax-groups.jpg)
  
### Set up a transit account
The transit general ledger account is the account that will be credited when transactions are redrawn to the third party. You must set up the ledger account to redraw charges to third parties.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Setup** > **Accounts payable parameters**.
2. On the **General** tab, in the **Transit account** field, select the transit general ledger account to use during the redraw debt transaction.

  - If the invoice was created from the vendor invoice journal:
    
    - If you redraw debt to vendors, the invoice journals are automatically created and posted. If you set the **Create             invoice for payment** option to **Yes**, the invoice for payment will automatically be posted.
