# VAT declaration (Finland)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to set up and generate a value-added tax (VAT) declaration for Finland in the official TXT format. It also describes how to preview the VAT declaration in Microsoft Excel.

To automatically generate the report, first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each type of operation that is subject to reporting in the VAT declaration for Finland. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the Electronic reporting (ER) format for the VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes with the lookup result of the **Report field lookup** lookup field. In the following table, the "Lookup result" column shows the lookup result that is preconfigured for a specific VAT declaration field ID in the VAT declaration format. Use this information to correctly associate sales tax codes with the lookup result and then with the field ID of the VAT declaration.

## VAT declaration overview

The VAT declaration for Finland contains the following fields that are used to report VAT-related amounts.

| Field ID (Tunnus) | Description (English) | Description (Finnish) | Lookup result |

For more information about how to configure reverse charge VAT, see [Reverse charges](emea-reverse-charge.md).

For more information about how to set up application-specific parameters, see the [Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields](#set-up) section later in this article.

## Set up the VAT declaration for Finland

These tasks will prepare your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance environment to generate the electronic file for the VAT declaration for Finland and preview the VAT amounts in Excel format.

- [Import ER configurations](#import-er).
- [Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields](#set-up).
- [Set up the VAT reporting format to preview amounts in Excel](#setup-preview).
- [Set up electronic messages](#setup-em).
- [Set up the VAT registration number of the company that is reporting VAT](#vat-id).

### <a name="import-er"></a>Import ER configurations

Open the **Electronic reporting** workspace, and import the latest versions of these ER formats under **Tax declaration model**:

- VAT Declaration TXT (FI)
- VAT Declaration Excel (FI)

For more information, see [Download ER configurations from the Global repository of Configuration service](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).

### <a name="set-up"></a>Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields

To automatically generate the VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes in Finance and lookup results in the ER configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you enable the **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled, parameters that are configured for an earlier version of an ER format automatically become applicable for a later version of the same format. If this feature isn't enabled, you must explicitly configure application-specific parameters for each format version. The **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature is available in the **Feature management** workspace as of Finance version 10.0.23. For more information about how to set up the parameters of an ER format for each legal entity, see [Set up the parameters of an ER format per legal entity](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-app-specific-parameters-set-up.md).

Follow these steps to define which sales tax codes in your Finance generate which field ID on the VAT declaration for Finland.

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT declaration TXT (FI)** configuration, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Configurations \> Application specific parameters setup**.
3. On the **Application specific parameters** page, on the **Lookups** FastTab, select **Report field lookup**.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, set the following fields to associate the sales tax codes and report fields.


    | Field | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Lookup result | Select the value of the report field. For more information about the values and their assignment to VAT declaration rows, see the [VAT declaration overview](#vat-declaration-overview) section earlier in this article. |
    | Tax code | Select the sales tax code to associate with the report field. Posted tax transactions that use the selected sales tax code will be collected in the appropriate declaration box. We recommend that you separate sales tax codes in such a way that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box. |
    | Transaction classifier | <p>If you created enough sales tax codes to determine a declaration box, select **\*Not blank\***. If you didn't create enough sales tax codes so that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box, you can set up a transaction classifier. The following transaction classifiers are available:</p><ul><li>**Purchase**</li><li>**PurchaseExempt** (tax-exempt purchase)</li><li>**PurchaseReverseCharge** (tax receivable from a purchase reverse charge)</li><li>**Sales**</li><li>**SalesExempt** (tax-exempt sale)</li><li>**SalesReverseCharge** (tax payable from a purchase reverse charge or a sales reverse charge)</li><li>**Use tax**</li></ul><p>For each transaction classifier, a classifier for the credit note is also available. For example, one of these classifiers is **PurchaseCreditNote** (purchase credit note).</p><p>Be sure to create two lines for each sales tax code: one that has the transaction classifier value and one that has the transaction classifier for credit note value.</p> |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Associate all sales tax codes with lookup results. If any sales tax codes should not generate values on the VAT declaration, associate them with the **Other** lookup result.

5. In the **State** field, change the value to **Completed**.
6. On the Action Pane, select **Export** to export the settings of the application-specific parameters.
7. Select the **VAT declaration Excel (FI)** configuration, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Import** to import the parameters that you configured for **VAT declaration TXT (FI)**.
8. In the **State** field, select **Completed**.

3. In the **Report layout** field, select **Default**.
4. Go to **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
5. On the **Sales tax** tab, on the **Tax options** FastTab, in the **VAT statement format mapping** field, select the **VAT declaration Excel (FI)** ER format.

    This format is printed when you run the **Report sales tax for settlement period** report. It's also printed when you select **Print** on the **Sales tax payments** page.

6. If you must report the corrections, on the **Special report** section, set **Include corrections** to **Yes**.

If you're configuring the VAT declaration for Finland in a legal entity that has [multiple VAT registrations](emea-reporting-for-multiple-vat-registrations.md),
follow these steps.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
2. On the **Sales tax** tab, on the **Electronic reporting for countries/regions** FastTab, on the line for **FIN**, select the **VAT Declaration Excel (FI)** ER format.

### <a name="setup-em"></a>Set up electronic messages

Electronic messaging (EM) functionality is provided to maintain the different processes that are used in electronic reporting for different document types. For more information about electronic messages, see [Electronic messaging](../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.md).

#### <a name="import-em"></a>Download and import the data package that has example settings for electronic messages

The process of setting up the Electronic messages functionality to generate the VAT declaration for Finland in TXT format and preview it in Excel has many steps. Because the data of some entities is used in the ER configurations, use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables. You can extend these settings or create your own.

> [!NOTE]
> Some records in the data entities in the package include a link to ER configurations. Before you start to import the data entities package, [import ER configurations into Finance](#import-er).

1. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2), in the Shared asset library, select **Data package** as the asset type, and then download **FI VAT declaration EM package**. The downloaded file is named **FI VAT declaration EM package.zip**.
2. In Finance, in the **Data management** workspace, select **Import**.
3. On the **Import** FastTab, in the **Group name** field, enter a name for the job.
4. On the **Selected entities** FastTab, select **Add file**.
5. In the **Add file** dialog box, verify that the **Source data format** field is set to **Package**, select **Upload and add**, and then select the zip file that you downloaded earlier.
6. Select **Close**.
7. After the data entities are uploaded, on the Action Pane, select **Import**.
8. Go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages**, and validate the electronic message processing that you imported (**FI VAT declaration**).

For more information about how you can use the data management framework, see [Data management](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md).

#### Configure electronic messages

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Populate records actions**.
2. Select the line for **FI Populate VAT return records**, and then select **Edit query**.
3. Use the filter to specify the settlement periods to include on the report.
4. If you must report tax transactions from other settlement periods in a different declaration, create a new **Populate records** action, and select the appropriate settlement periods.

### <a id="vat-id"></a>Set up the VAT registration number of the company that is reporting VAT

To generate the VAT declaration, you must configure the tax registration number of your organization (field 010, "Asiakkaan y-tunnus tai henkilötunnus").

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**.
2. Select the legal entity, and then select **Registration IDs**.
3. Select or create the address in Finland, and then, on the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
4. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that is dedicated to Finland and that uses the **VAT ID** registration category.
5. In the **Registration number** field, enter the tax number.
6. On the **General** tab, in the **Effective** field, enter the date when the number becomes effective.

For more information about how to set up registration categories and registration types, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

Follow these steps to define the VAT registration number that EM uses during generation of the VAT declaration for Finland.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages processing**, and select the **FI VAT declaration** processing.
2. On the **Message additional fields** FastTab, in the **Tax registration number** field, define the VAT registration number that should be used in the VAT declaration for Finland.
3. Save your changes.

If the VAT registration number isn't specified in the **Tax registration number** additional field of the **FI VAT declaration** processing, the system retrieves it from the registration ID that is defined in the properties of the legal entity that is associated with the **VAT ID** registration category.

### Preview the VAT declaration in Excel from a sales tax payment

Sales tax payment transaction are produced by the [Settle and post sales tax](../general-ledger/tasks/create-sales-tax-payment.md) job procedure that settles sales tax balances in the sales tax accounts and offsets them to the sales tax settlement account for a given period. After the **Settle and post sales tax** job procedure is completed for an interval of the sales tax settlement period, you can generate the VAT declaration in Excel from the **Sales tax payments** page.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Sales tax inquiries** \> **Sales tax payments**, and select a sales tax payment line.
2. Select **Print report**, and then select **OK**.
3. Review the Excel file that is generated for the selected sales tax payment line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The report is generated only for the selected line of the sales tax payment. If you must generate, for example, a corrective declaration that contains all corrections for the period, or a replacement declaration that contains original data and all corrections, use the [Report sales tax for settlement period](#report-sales-tax-for-settlement-period) periodic task.

## Generate the electronic file for the VAT declaration from electronic messages

When you use electronic messages to generate the report, you can collect tax data from multiple legal entities. For more information, see the [Run the VAT declaration for multiple legal entities](#run-the-vat-declaration-for-multiple-legal-entities) section later in this article.
