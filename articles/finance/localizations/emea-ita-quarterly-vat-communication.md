# Quarterly VAT communication report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to Legislative Decree no. 127/2015, article 1, and Decree Law 78/2010, article 21, **Periodic VAT payment communication** (**Comunicazione IVA periodica con prospetto di liquidazione, LIPE**) information must be transmitted electronically in XML format to the Italian tax authorities.

## Set up the Quarterly VAT communication (LIPE) report

### Prerequisites

Before you set up the **Quarterly VAT communication (LIPE)** report, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**.
2. On the **Registration numbers** FastTab, in the **Italy** section, in the **Fiscal code** field, enter your organization's fiscal code. (This code has between 11 and 16 digits.)
3. On the **Tax registration** FastTab, in the **Tax exempt number** field, enter your organization's tax exempt number. (This number has 11 digits.)

### Create a number sequence

According to the requirements, the name of the **Quarterly VAT Communication (LIPE)** report must consist of several components:

- An International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
- An 11-character or 16-character tax code, followed by an underscore (_)
- A file type (**LI**), followed by an underscore (_)
- A five-character progressive number that consists only of lowercase letters a–z, uppercase letters A–Z, or numbers 0–9

Here are some examples:

- ITAAABBB99T99X999W_LI_00001.xml
- IT99999999999_LI_00002.xml

For the progressive number, a system number sequence is used. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Number sequences** \> **Number sequences**, and create a number sequence. This number sequence must be continuous and five characters long, and it must be alphanumeric (that is, it must consist only of lowercase letters a–z, uppercase letters A–Z, and numbers 0–9).

For example:

    For more information, see [Download ER configurations from the Global repository](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Be sure to import the most recent versions of these configurations. The description of each version usually includes the number of the Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) article that explains the changes that were introduced in that version.

2. After all the ER configurations from the preceding table are imported, set the **Default for model mapping** option to **Yes** for the **Quarterly VAT Communication model mapping** configuration.
3. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
4. Select **Italian tax report model** \> **Quarterly VAT Communication**, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Create configuration**.
5. In the drop-down dialog box, select the **Derive from Name: Quarterly VAT Communication** option, enter a name and description for the new format, and then select **Create configuration**.

    ![Derive ER format to create the format for your company.](./media/derive-er-format.png)

    The new format includes all the fields and mapping from the original. In the new format, you can make changes to meet your company's requirements.

6. Select the new format, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Designer**.

    The **Format designer** page is divided into two parts. The left side shows a format structure (XML scheme), and the right side shows a data model (data).

    For more information about ER, see [Electronic reporting (ER) overview](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md)

    Values for the following tags of the report are collected from tax transactions that are posted in the system. The values consider the specific tax codes that your company uses and the tax directions that are applicable to your company's operations.

    - TotaleOperazioniAttive
    - TotaleOperazioniPassive
    - IvaEsigibile
    - IvaDetratta

    To set up tax codes for the report, on the **Format designer** page, on the **Mapping** tab, expand **Model** \> **AccountingData** \> **MonthlyData**, select the **ActiveVATOperations** node, and then select **Edit**.

    ![Edit formula for active VAT operations.](./media/edit-formula-active-vat-operations.png)

7. In the **'Calculated field' data source properties** dialog box, select **Edit formula**.
8. Update the formula with the tax codes that your company uses and the tax direction that is applicable to your company's operations. Manually define the tax codes as string values. For the tax directions, select values from the **TaxDirection_Type** data source on the left side of the **Formula designer** page.

   ![Add your company's tax codes in formula designer.](./media/formula-designer.png)

   When the report is generated, the system will use the conditions that are defined for the **ActiveVATOperations** node to calculate values for the **TotaleOperazioniAttive** and **IvaEsigibile** tags of the report.

9. When you've finished editing the formula, save your changes, close the **Formula designer** page, and select **OK** in the **'Calculated field' data source properties** dialog box.
10. On the **Format designer** page, on the **Mapping** tab, expand **Model** \> **AccountingData** \> **MonthlyData**, select the **PassiveVATOperations** node, and then select **Edit**.
11. In the **'Calculated field' data source properties** dialog box, select **Edit formula**.
12. Update the formula with the tax codes that your company uses and the tax directions that are applicable to your company's operations, as you did for the **ActiveVATOperations** node, to define the conditions that the system will use calculate the values for the **TotaleOperazioniPassive** and **IvaDetratta** tags of the report.
13. To specify the number sequence that the system should use for the progressive numbers that are included in the file name for the report file, on the **Format designer** page, on the **Mapping** tab, select **Add root**.
14. In the drop-down dialog box, expand **Dynamics 365 for Operations**, and then select **Number sequence**.

      ![Add number sequence to your format.](./media/add-num-seq.png)

15. Enter a name, select the number sequence that you created earlier, and then select **OK** to create the number sequence.

       ![Specify a name for your number sequence in ER format.](./media/num0seq-name.png)

    ![Edit formula for name of the file with number sequence name.](./media/file-name-edit.png)

17. Update **"IT"&model.Frontispiece.FiscalCode&"_LI_00000"** with a formula that includes a link to the new number sequence:
    
      - **"IT"&model.Frontispiece.FiscalCode&"_LI_"&LIPE_file_num**. Here, **LIPE_file_num** is the name that you gave to the number sequence. To add **LIPE_file_num** to the formula, click **Add data source**. When you've finished, select **Save**.

      ![Edit formula for file name with number sequence name.](./media/file-name-formula-designer.png)

18. Save your changes in the ER format, and complete the configuration.

### Update input parameters

The values of some format tags must be filled in manually. The tags are included in the report dialog box so that you can set the values.

By default, the **Quarterly VAT Communication** format includes all possible parameters. To add, delete, or update parameters in the report dialog box, on the **Format designer** page, on the **Mapping** tab, switch to **Group view**, and then select the **Empty containers** element.

   ![Empty containers.](./media/empty-containers.png)

The **Empty containers** element includes all the input parameters for the report. Before you delete an input parameter, you must unbind it or update the mapping for the corresponding field. Expand the format structure tree on the left side of the **Format designer** page, find the corresponding field, and delete or update the binding.

To add an input parameter, add it in the corresponding node in the **Empty containers** element, select a tag in the format structure tree, and then select **Bind**.

   ![Bind an input parameter.](./media/binding.png)

When you've finished updating the format, save, close, and complete it.

### Set up General ledger parameters
