# Get started with Electronic invoicing for Poland

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information that will help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Poland. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) and in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. These steps complement the steps that are described in [Set up Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the procedures in this article, complete the following prerequisites:

- The legal entity must be registered as a taxpayer in Poland and must have a valid tax identification number (*Numer identyfikacji podatkowej*, or NIP).
- A valid certificate for digital signing must be obtained from the appropriate authorities.
- Become familiar with Electronic invoicing as it's described in [Electronic invoicing overview](e-invoicing-service-overview.md).
- Sign up for RCS, and set up Electronic invoicing. For more information, see the following articles:

    - [Sign up for and install the Electronic Invoicing service](e-invoicing-sign-up-install.md)
    - [Set up Azure resources for Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-set-up-azure-resources.md)
    - [Install the add-in for microservices in Lifecycle Services](e-invoicing-install-add-in-microservices-lcs.md)

- Activate the integration between your Finance or Supply Chain Management app and the Electronic Invoicing service as described in [Activate and setup integration with Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-activate-setup-integration.md).
- Create certificates and secrets in Azure Key Vault, and set up Key Vault as described in [Customer certificates and secrets](e-invoicing-customer-certificates-secrets.md):

    - The secret for the legal entity's tax identification number
    - The secret that will contain the public key that is provided by the Polish National system for electronic invoicing ([KSeF](https://www.podatki.gov.pl/ksef))
    - The certificate for digital signing

- Make sure that the following Electronic reporting (ER) format configurations are imported. For more information, see [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-import-ger-configurations.md).

    - Sales e-invoice (PL)
    - Project e-invoice (PL)
    - Advance e-invoice (PL)

## Country-specific configuration for the Polish electronic invoice (PL) feature

Some of the parameters from the **Polish electronic invoice (PL)** electronic invoicing feature are published with default values. Before you deploy the electronic invoicing feature to the service environment, review the default values, and update them as required so that they better reflect your business operations.

1. Import the latest version of the **Polish electronic invoice (PL)** Globalization feature as described in [Import features from the Global repository](e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
2. Create a copy of the imported Globalization feature, and select your configuration provider for it, as described in [Create a Globalization feature](e-invoicing-create-new-globalization-feature.md).
3. On the **Versions** tab, verify that the **Draft** version is selected.
4. On the **Setups** tab, in the grid, select the **Submit batch** feature setup, and then select **Edit**.
5. On the **Processing pipeline** tab, in the **Processing pipeline** section, select the **(Preview) KSeF send batch to e-invoice system** action.
6. In the **Parameters** section, select **Client ID**, and then select the name of the secret that you previously created for the legal entity's tax identification number.
7. Select **Certificate name**, and then select the name of the digital certificate that you created.
8. Select **Public key**, and then select the name of the secret that you created for the public key.
9. Select **Service URL**, and make sure that a valid URL is configured. To get the testing and production URLs, go to the website of the Polish National system for electronic invoicing ([KSeF](https://www.podatki.gov.pl/ksef)).
10. In the **Processing pipeline** section, select the **(Preview) KSeF get batch status from e-invoice system** action.

14. On the **Applicability rules** tab, in the **LegalEntityID** field, make sure that a valid legal entity code is configured in the **Value** column.
15. Select **Save** (if you made any changes), and close the page.
16. Repeat steps 13 through 15 for the **Submit project invoice** and **Submit advance invoice** feature setups.

## Finance configuration

Some additional parameters must be configured directly in Finance.

2. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
3. In the **Electronic document** section, add records for the **Customer Invoice journal**, **Project invoice** and **Advance invoice** table names.
4. For each table name, set the **Document context** and **Electronic document model mapping** fields in accordance with step 1.
5. For the **Customer Invoice journal** table name, select **Response types**.
6. Create a response type that has the same name that was defined for the related variable of the **To client** type in the corresponding feature setups in RCS. Enter the following values:

    - In the **Submission status** field, select **Pending**.
    - In the **Model mapping** field, select **KSeF response data import format (PL)**.

7. Repeat steps 5 through 6 for the **Project invoice** and **Advance invoice** electronic documents.
8. In the **Feature management** workspace, the **Export channels for electronic invoicing integration** feature must be enabled. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).
9. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, on the **Reporting configurations** tile, select the **Customer invoice context model** configuration.
10. Select **Create configuration**, and then, in the drop-down dialog box, select the **Derive from Name: Customer invoice context model, Microsoft** option to create a derived configuration.

13. In the **Value** field, select **Edit**, and enter the data channel name. The value is the name of the data channel that is configured in the **Export channel** section for the **Submit batch** feature setup in RCS.
14. Save your changes, and complete the derived configuration.
15. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
16. <a id="channel"></a>On the **Integration channels** tab, add a channel that has the same name that was used in step 13.

## Issue electronic invoices

When you've completed all the required configuration steps, you can generate and submit electronic invoices for posted invoices.
