# Scope of Mexican localization

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In general, Microsoft invests significant resources to extend business process functionality by developing features and functionality that address specific tax, accounting, or financial regulatory requirements in countries or regions where Microsoft makes Dynamics 365 Finance generally available.

Dynamics 365 Finance helps organizations run their business operations and also manage their obligations to comply with country/region-specific laws, regulations, and common business practices for handling their daily activities. This software includes features and functionality that are designed to address specific federal tax, accounting, financial, or statutory reporting laws or regulations that commonly affect businesses in Mexico.

However, Finance doesn't address all laws, regulations, or commercial requirements in Mexico, because laws and regulations vary in the way that they affect organizations. For example, regulatory features that Microsoft creates and makes generally available "out of the box" for Finance in Mexico don't typically include functionality that supports the following, except as specifically noted in this topic:

- National Standards
- Payroll
- Industry-specific regulations
- Vertical regulations 
- State, city, or municipal requirements

Additional details are available in the [Localization Availability Guide](https://aka.ms/ax-availabilityguide).

Channel partners are an important part of our global strategy for helping customers meet requirements for Mexico. By taking advantage of the extensible nature of the development architecture of Finance, channel partners can address a customer's specific business needs during implementation through either of the following approaches:

- Configuration of the software (when available)
- Partner-created customizations or localizations (when required)

Although channel partners might provide solutions that meet specific regulatory requirements that are unique to municipalities, cities, states, or other regions in Mexico, Microsoft doesn't provide any guarantees or warranties (expressed, implied, statutory, or otherwise) that partner-created solutions comply with local business, tax and regulatory, legal, or other applicable requirements.

Channel partners or customers are solely responsible for any configurations, customizations, localizations, or translations that they create or implement on behalf of customers, and also for any updates to such solutions. They are also solely responsible for any support or other service that is provided to customers for these solutions. You must contact your channel partner for information about the solutions that the channel partner creates for licensed versions of Finance.

This topic describes the strategy and scope of specific requirements that Microsoft has implemented as part of the Finance and Operations software that it made generally commercially available in Mexico.

## Terminology and abbreviations
**Customization** refers to either of the following:

- Any configuration, modifications, or changes that partners or customers make either to the Microsoft Dynamics software itself or, when applicable, to the software documentation to fit a customer's specific business needs. Examples include adding or renaming fields or tables, creating custom reports, or integrating with third-party solutions.
- Any software that is developed for the Microsoft Dynamics software.

**Localization** refers to any modification to, addition to, or adaptation of the Microsoft Dynamics software to enable or include specific features or functionality in the software so that it conforms to applicable regulatory requirements (including, without limitation, versions and updates of the Microsoft Dynamics software, user assistance tools, and end-user documentation). Here are some examples of laws or regulatory requirements that might require localization of the software:

- Local tax reporting, such as reporting for sales tax, value-added tax (VAT), and goods and services tax (GST)
- Invoice tracking by a government authority
- Government-required tax calculations
- Local accounting rules
- Local regulatory and statutory reporting

**National Standards** refer to feature requirements in software that are related primarily to banking practices (such as payment methods, payment formats, and bank statements) and less frequently to commercial documents (such as electronic fiscal documents). National Standards are local requirements that aren't required by law or regulation, but that are widely adopted within a geographic region and critical to the sale of licenses for business management software in that geographic region.

| Abbreviation | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| CFD          | Electronic invoices by one's own means (self-submission) – Comprobantes fiscales digitales |
| CFDI         | Electronic invoices by internet – Comprobantes fiscales digitales por internet |
| DIOT         | Declaration of operations with a third party – Declaración informativa de operaciones con terceros |
| IEPS         | Special tax over manufacturing and services – Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios |
| ISR          | Income tax – Impuesto sobre la Renta |
| IVA          | VAT sales tax – Impuesto al Valor Agregado |
| PAC          | Authorized digital signature service provider – Proveedores autorizados de certificación |
| SAT          | Tax administration Service – Servicio de Administración Tributaria |
| UUID         | Universally unique identifier – Identificador universalmente único |

## Mexican localization strategy

In general, the Microsoft strategy for addressing the tax, financial, accounting, or statutory reporting requirements for Mexico consists of providing localizations that do the following:

- Implement the federal tax requirements that are detailed in the [Mexican localization scope](#mexican-localization-scope) section later in this topic.
- Deliver specific new regulatory features through configurations or through the development of new functionality that implements the federal requirements that are detailed in the [Mexican localization scope](#mexican-localization-scope) section, in accordance with the information that is specified in this topic.
- Deliver specific new regulatory features in the most recent service pack that is available, or in a new service pack, for supported versions of Finance.
- Apply National Standards and competitive features in the localization, as Microsoft, at its sole discretion, determines them to be necessary or appropriate, based on business needs in the region.
- Don't focus on the requirements of specific businesses, segments, verticals, regions, or large enterprises, even when these requirements are required by laws, statutes, or regulations at the federal, state, or city levels.
- Exclude municipal requirements, except for the municipal requirements that are detailed in the [Mexican localization scope](#mexican-localization-scope) section.

There are specific laws and requirements that are out of scope for Finance. These laws and requirements are listed in the [Out of scope](#out-of-scope) section later in this topic.

The Mexican localizations that Microsoft develops are limited to the features and functionality that are described in this topic. Therefore, Finance must be analyzed by prospective customers or by a tax professional (such as an accounting and tax auditor, tax law firm, or tax consulting firm) who can perform an assessment to determine whether the functionality is appropriate to meet the customer's business needs, or whether custom solutions are required.

## Mexican localization scope
The user interface and online Help are translated into Mexican Spanish. Additional documentation, such as white papers and training materials, might be available in English only and might not be available when the software is first made generally available in Mexico.

The localization scope for the version of Finance that is available in Mexico is limited to tax calculation, accounting transactions, and issuing and receiving invoices in the following scenarios: 

- Procure to pay
- Quote to cash
- Regulatory/statutory reporting

For a list of the specific features that Microsoft delivers and supports, see the [Supported features](#supported-features) section later in this document. You can find details about each feature in Help within Finance, in online Help, and in white papers that are published on the [Microsoft Dynamics Localization Portal](https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/deployment/resources/productreleases/gfmlocalizationportalmc.htm?printpage=false&sid=xdtafwuk1xh2l5jdjhhv0joy&stext=gfm%20localization%20portal).

## Market availability
Microsoft aims to deliver regulatory features in a manner that provides enough time for installation. In the case of tax and regulatory updates that contain changes that are required in order to implement tax, accounting, financial, or regulatory/statutory reporting requirements that commonly affect a majority of businesses in Mexico, our goal is to release the updates before the effective date or other date that is mandated by the applicable government authority, whether at the federal or state level as identified in the [Mexican localization strategy](#mexican-localization-strategy) section, so that our channel partners have enough time to update their customer solutions. Internally, we call this date the *market required date* (MRD).

We strive to meet our established MRDs and dates that are mandated by the applicable government authority. However, various factors can affect the timely delivery of tax and regulatory updates. These factors include the following:

- Legislative or regulatory changes that the government makes without enough notice before the date that the law takes effect
- Feature, functionality, infrastructure, or architectural limitations of the affected software versions that are generally available in the marketplace
- The complexity and coverage of the coding, redesign, or enhancement of the software that is required to implement the legislation or regulatory requirements, or schedule conflicts

If it isn't feasible to meet these dates, we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and release tax and regulatory updates as soon as possible.

Any dates that Microsoft publishes are for planning purposes only and are subject to change at any time without notice.

Microsoft makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees about the timeliness or completeness of any tax or regulatory update that it provides, and, to the maximum extent that is permitted under applicable law, disclaims all implied warranties and conditions, such as implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
