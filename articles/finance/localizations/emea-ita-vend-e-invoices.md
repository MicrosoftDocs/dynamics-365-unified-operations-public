# Vendor electronic invoices

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to Italian legislation, invoices that are received from foreign vendors that aren't Italian tax residents must be submitted to the Exchange system (SDI). This article explains how configure and submit vendor electronic invoices in the **FatturaPA** electronic format.

## Prerequisites

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.
- The export of vendor electronic invoices must be implemented symmetrically to the export of Italian customer electronic invoices, and it must use the common parameters that are defined on the **Electronic invoice parameters** page in Accounts receivable. Those parameters must be configured in advance. For more information, see [Customer electronic invoices](emea-ita-e-invoices.md).

## Invoice types processing

Invoice types that are associated with the sales tax code that is used on an invoice are automatically entered in the **TipoDocumento** tag of the XML file that is generated for the electronic invoice.

If no invoice type is associated with the sales tax code, the following types of vendor invoice documents will automatically be entered:

- **TD16** – For vendors that are located in Italy, if an invoice contains a sales tax code where either **Use tax** or **Reverse charge** is activated.
- **TD17** – For vendors that are located in the European Union (EU), if an invoice is issued for the provision of **services**.
- **TD18** – For vendors that are located in the EU, if an invoice is issued for the sale of **products**.
- **TD28** – For vendors that are located in the San-Marino and the sales tax amount is greater then zero (available from version 273.47 of the **Vendor Invoice (IT)** format).

If a required invoice type isn't entered, you can manually adjust the invoice type in the vendor invoice journal.

### Configure electronic document properties

2. Select **New** to add a property type.
2. In the **Type** field, enter **DocumentType**. 
3. Select **Applicability** to add an applicable table. 
4. On the **Electronic document property type applicability setup** page, in **Table name** field, select **Vendor invoice journal**.
5. Save and return to the **Electronic document property types** page.
