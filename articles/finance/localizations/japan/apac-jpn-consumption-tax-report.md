# Japan consumption tax report

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and generate the Japan Consumption Tax (JCT) return report for legal entities in Japan.

The Japan consumption tax report consists of: **Consumption Tax and Local Consumption Tax Return** (Table 1), **Breakdown of Taxable Base Amount** (Table 2), and the following Appendixes:

- **Appendix 1** represents **Consumption tax amount calculation table by tax rate and consumption tax amount calculation sheet that serves as the tax base for local consumption tax**. It can be composed of Appendix 1-3 for the 6.24 percent and 7.8 percent tax rates, supplemented by Appendix 1-1 and Appendix 1-2 in cases where other tax rates were used during the reporting period (3 percent, 4 percent, or 6.3 percent).
- **Appendix 2** represents **Calculation table for taxable sales ratio, deductible purchase tax amount, etc.** It can be composed of Appendix 2-3 for the 6.24 percent and 7.8 percent tax rates, supplemented by Appendix 2-1 and Appendix 2-2 in cases where other tax rates were used during the reporting period (3 percent, 4 percent, or 6.3 percent).

For a description of the calculation rules for the JCT return report, see [Procedure 1 for preparing a tax return](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/zeimokubetsu/shohi/keigenzeiritsu/pdf/0018008-056_01.pdf).

## Set up sales tax reporting codes for consumption tax reporting
