# Set up deferrals (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Deferrals are expense types that are stored differently in general accounting principles and tax accounting principles. To use the deferral functionality, you must complete the following setup:

- [Write-off methods](#write-off-methods)
- [Value models](#value-models)
- [Posting profiles](#posting-profiles)
- [Sequence of calculation](#sequence-of-calculation)
- [Deferrals groups](#deferrals-groups)
- [General ledger parameters](#general-ledger-parameters)
- [Deferrals](#deferrals)

## Write-off methods

Follow these steps to create write-off methods for deferred expenses.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Deferrals setup** \> **Writing off methods**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New** to create a write-off method for deferred expenses.

    The following table describes the fields on the **Writing off methods** page.

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>Writing off method</td>
    <td>Enter the code for the write-off method.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Enter a description of the write-off method.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>Select the type of write-off:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Linear</strong> – Evenly divide the write-off amount across all intervals in the defined period.</li>
    <li><strong>Manual</strong> – Manually enter either a percentage of the total or the amount to write off in each period, depending on the calculation type that you select in the <strong>Calculation type</strong> field. On the <strong>Manual schedules</strong> page, you can set up a different percentage for each write-off period. On the <strong>Writing off sum</strong> page, you can set up a different amount for each write-off period.</li>
    <li><strong>Linear with factor</strong> – Multiply the calculated result by a calculated factor.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Writing off period</td>
    <td>Select the write-off period for the deferred expense:
    <ul>
    <li>Month</li>
    <li>Quarter</li>
    <li>Half-Yearly</li>
    <li>Years</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Calculation period</td>
    <td>Select the calculation period for the deferred expense:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Month</strong> – The deferrals write-off calculation is done proportionately over the number of months in the given period.</li>
    <li><strong>Day</strong> – The deferrals write-off calculation is done proportionately over the number of days in the given period. This option lets you calculate the deferred expense write-off amount for an incomplete reporting period, based on the number of calendar days in the period.</li>
    <li><strong>Period</strong> – The calculation is done proportionately for the number of periods that are defined in the <strong>Writing off period</strong> field.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Calculation type</td>
    <td>If you selected <strong>Manual</strong> in the <strong>Type</strong> field, select the calculation type for the manual write-off:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Percent</strong> – A percentage of the total is written off in each period. You manually enter this percentage on the <strong>Manual schedules</strong> page.</li>
    <li><strong>Amount</strong> – An amount is written off. On the <strong>Writing off sum</strong> page, you can set up a separate amount for each write-off period.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>

    <tr>
    <td>Round-off</td>
    <td>Enter the round-off value for the deferred expense write-off amount.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

3. If you selected **Manual** in the **Type** field and **Amount** in the **Calculation type** field, on the Action Pane, select **Manual schedules** to create write-off schedules.

![Deferrals groups page](media/rus-set-up-deferral-04.png)

## Sequence of calculation

You use the **Standard expenses sequence** and **Counter setup** pages to create calculation sequences that are used to create deferrals for vendor invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can set up the calculation sequence and counters, you must set up expense codes on the **Expense and income codes** page.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Deferrals setup** \> **Sequence of calculation**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New** to set up revenue or expense calculation sequences.

    The following table describes the fields on the **Standard expenses sequence** page.

    | Field             | Description                                                             |

    | Channel           | Select the deferral output format for the calculation results.          |
    | Channel reference | Select the deferred expense group to record the calculation results to. If necessary, you can create deferrals for the bookkeeping accounting and tax accounting models at the same time by separating them with commas.|

    ![Standard expenses sequence page](media/rus-set-up-deferral-05.png)

3. On the Action Pane, select **Counters** to open the **Counter setup** page.
4. On the Action Pane, select **New** to create counters for the calculation sequence.

    The following table describes the fields on the **Counter setup** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must select an expense code. When you use the periodic process to generate deferrals, the expense code that is specified for a counter is used to generate deferrals for vendor invoices that have the same expense code.
