# Reporting for multiple VAT registrations 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to do reporting for multiple value-added tax (VAT) registrations from a single legal entity. The functionality is available for the following countries or regions: 

- [Austria](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-at.md)
- [Belgium](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-be.md)
- [Czechia](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-cz.md)
- [Denmark](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-dk.md)
- [Finland](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-fi.md)
- [France](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-fr.md)
- [Germany](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-de.md)
- [Netherlands](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-nl.md)
- [Norway](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-no.md)
- [Poland](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-pl.md)
- [Spain](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-es.md)
- [Sweden](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-se.md)
- [Switzerland](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-ch.md)
- [United Kingdom](emea-reporting-multiple-vat-registrations-uk.md)
  
The scope of reporting is limited to generation of the following reports:

- [Intrastat](#intrastat-reporting)
- [EU sales list](#eu-sales-list)
- [VAT declaration](#vat-declaration)

For an overview of the functionality, view the following TechTalk session from September 29, 2021: [VAT Reporting for Multiple Tax Registrations in Single Legal Entity](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/post/?postid=a366e6b4-d44c-4849-bdff-d77468e84aec).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, the following prerequisites must be configured:

- **Tax Calculation service**. For more information, see [Tax Calculation](global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md).
- **Support multiple VAT registration numbers**. For more information, see [Multiple VAT registration numbers](emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md).

### Enable features in feature management

1. Go to **Workspaces** > **Feature management**.
2. In the feature list, select and enable the following features:

    - Intrastat reporting for multiple VAT registrations
    - EU Sales list reporting for multiple VAT registrations
    - EU sales list transfer based on tax transactions only
    - Sales tax declaration for multiple VAT registrations

> [!NOTE]
> If you transfer between warehouses in different countries/regions that have a tax registration, you must also enable the **Tax in transfer order** feature and configure the Tax Calculation service for tax in transfer orders. For more information, see [Tax feature support for transfer orders](tasks/tax-feature-support-for-transfer-order.md).

## Activate feature for specific legal entity

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Tax configuration** > **Tax calculation parameters**.
2. On the **General** tab, set **Enable tax service** to **Yes**.
3. On the **Multiple VAT registrations** tab, set **VAT declaration**, **EU Sales List**, and **Intrastat** to **Yes** to activate VAT reporting, EU sales list reporting, or Intrastat reporting respectively, for the selected legal entity.

> [!NOTE]
> Only country/region-specific functionality that's applicable to the country/region of the primary address of the selected legal entity is available. Formats for the VAT declaration, EU sales list, and Intrastat are available for countries/regions of other VAT registrations. Other country/region-specific functionality that's applicable to the countries/regions of other VAT registrations isn't available in this legal entity.

## Set up country/region properties for multiple VAT registrations

1. Go to **Tax** > **Set up** > **Foreign trade** > **Foreign trade parameters**.
2. On the **Country/region properties** tab, set up the following country/region types: **EU**, **EFTA**, or **Third country/region**.

    The following information applies to documents about movements of goods between European Union (EU) countries/regions, except movements within the same country/region (for example from Belgium to Belgium):

    - By default, the list code is **EU trade**, and it's transferred to the EU sales list.
    - Documents are transferred to Intrastat.

> [!NOTE]
> If the country/region of the legal entity's primary address is an EU member state, it must be set as an **EU** (not **Domestic**) country type on the **Country/region properties** tab. 

## <a name="intrastat-reporting"></a>Intrastat reporting for multiple VAT registrations

### Set up Intrastat for multiple VAT registrations

Intrastat parameters that are specified for a legal entity apply to all tax registrations that are set up in that legal entity.

1.  Go to **Tax** > **Set up** > **Foreign trade** > **Foreign trade parameters**.
2.  On the **Intrastat** tab, set up the parameters on the following FastTabs:

    - General: [Transaction codes](emea-intrastat.md#transaction-codes), worker, tax authority.
    - Minimum limit
    - Transfer
    - Check setup
    - Rounding rules
    - [Electronic reporting for countries/regions](#electronic-reporting)
    - Commodity code hierarchy

    ![Foreign trade parameters1.](media/Multipleid-image2.png)

3. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Foreign trade** \> [**Compression of Intrastat**](emea-intrastat.md#compressing-rules) to set up Intrastat compression rules. All tax registrations have the same setup for compression rules.

For more information about how to configure Intrastat, see [Intrastat overview](emea-intrastat.md).
