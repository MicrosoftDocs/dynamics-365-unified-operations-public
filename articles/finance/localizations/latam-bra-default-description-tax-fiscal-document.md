Follow these steps to set up default descriptions for voucher transactions that are posted from Tax fiscal documents.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Default descriptions**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Description** field, select **Tax fiscal document**.
4. In the **Language** field, select a language.
5. In the **Text** field, enter the default description text. The text supports the following placeholder variables:

    - **%1** – The transaction date.
    - **%2** – An identifier that corresponds to the document type that is being posted to the general ledger. For example, if a transaction type is related to an invoice, the %2 variable adds the invoice number.
    - **%3** – An identifier that is related to the document type that is being posted to the general ledger. For example, if a transaction type is related to an invoice, the %3 variable adds the customer account number.
