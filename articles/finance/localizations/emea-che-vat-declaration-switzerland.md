# VAT declaration (Switzerland)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Overview

This topic describes how to set up and generate a value-added tax (VAT) declaration for Switzerland in the official XML format (eCH-0217 eMWST standard). It also describes how to preview the VAT declaration in Microsoft Excel.

To automatically generate the report, you must first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each box on the VAT declaration. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the Electronic reporting (ER) format for the VAT declaration, you must associate sales tax codes with the lookup result of the lookups for the boxes on the VAT declaration.

For Switzerland, you must configure three lookups: **Turnover lookup**, **Report field lookup**, and **Other cash flow lookup**. For more information about how to set up application-specific parameters, see the [Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields](#set-up-application-specific-parameters-for-vat-declaration-fields) section later in this topic.

In the following table, the "Lookup result" column shows the lookup result that is preconfigured for a specific VAT declaration row in the VAT declaration format. Use this information to correctly associate sales tax codes with the lookup result and then with the row of the VAT declaration.

### VAT declaration overview

The VAT declaration in Switzerland contains the following information.

#### Purchase reverse charge VAT

If you configure sales tax codes to post incoming acquisition tax (reverse charge VAT) by using use tax, associate your sales tax codes with the lookup result of **Report field lookup** that contains "UseTax" in the name.

Alternatively, you can configure two separate sales tax codes: one for VAT due and one for VAT deduction. Then associate each code with the corresponding lookup results of **Report field lookup**.

For example, for supplies from January 1, 2018 - acquisition tax, you configure sales tax code **UT_S_RC** with use tax, and associate it with the **UseTaxAcquisitionTax** lookup result of **Report field lookup**. In this case, amounts that use the **UT_S_RC** sales tax code are reflected on lines 382 and 400 with the full amount, and on line 415 with the non-deductible amount, if there is any.

Alternatively, you configure two sales tax codes:

- **VAT_S_RC**, which has a tax rate value of -7.7 percent
- **InVAT_S_RC**, which has a tax rate value of 7.7 percent

You then associate the codes with lookup results in the following way:

- Associate **VAT_S_RC** with the **SuppliesAcquisitionTax** lookup result of **Report field lookup**.
- Associate **InVAT_S_RC** with the **InputTaxMaterialAndServices** lookup result of **Report field lookup**.

In this case, amounts that use the **VAT_S_RC** sales tax code will be reflected on line 382. Amounts that use the **InVAT_S_RC** sales tax code will be reflected on line 400 with full amount, and on line 415 with the non-deductible amount.

For more information about how to configure reverse charge VAT, see [Reverse charges]emea-reverse-charge.md).

## Configure system parameters

To generate a VAT declaration, configure the UID (company identification number).

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. Select the legal entity, and then select **Registration IDs**.
3. Select or create the address in Switzerland, and then, on the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
4. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that is dedicated to Switzerland, and that uses the **Enterprise ID (COID)** registration category.
5. In the **Registration number** field, enter the UID number in the following format: CHE-123.456.789.
6. On the **General** tab, in the **Effective** field, enter the date when the number becomes effective.
7. Repeat these steps to set up a line with the VAT number. In this case, select the registration type that uses the **VAT Id** registration category, and enter the number in the following format: CHE-123.456.789 TVA/MWST/IVA.

For more information about how to set up registration categories and registration types, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

## Set up a VAT declaration for Switzerland

### Import ER configurations

Open the **Electronic reporting** workspace, and import the following versions or later of these ER formats:

- VAT Declaration Excel (CH) version 96.16.9

### <a name="set-up-application-specific-parameters-for-vat-declaration-fields">Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields</a>

To automatically generate a VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes in the application and lookup results in the ER configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you enable the feature, **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled, parameters that are configured for the earlier version of an ER format automatically become applicable for the later version of the same format. If this feature is not enabled, you must configure application-specific parameters explicitly for each format version. The **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature is available in the **Feature management** workspace starting in Finance version 10.0.23. For more information about how to set up the parameters of an ER format for each legal entity, see [Set up the parameters of an ER format per legal entity](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-app-specific-parameters-set-up.md).

#### Set up Turnover lookup

For more information about the turnover values and their assignment to VAT declaration rows, see the [VAT declaration overview](#vat-declaration-overview) section earlier in this topic.                                                                                         |
   | Tax code               | Select the sales tax code to associate with the operation. Posted tax transactions that use the selected sales tax code will be collected in the appropriate declaration box. We recommend that you separate sales tax codes in such a way that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box.   |
   | Transaction classifier | If you created enough sales tax codes to determine a declaration box, select **\*Not blank\***. If you didn't create enough sales tax codes so that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box, you can set up a transaction classifier. The following transaction classifiers are available: <br>- **Purchase**<br>- **PurchaseExempt** (tax-exempt purchase) <br>- **PurchaseReverseCharge** (tax receivable from a purchase reverse charge) <br>- **Sales** <br>- **SalesExempt** (tax-exempt sale) <br>- **SalesReverseCharge** (tax payable from a purchase reverse charge or a sales reverse charge) <br>- **Use tax** <br> For each transaction classifier, a classifier for the credit note is also available. For example, one of these classifiers is **PurchaseCreditNote** (purchase credit note).|



   > [!NOTE]
   > Associate all sales tax codes with lookup results. If any sales tax codes should not generate values in section I, associate with the **Other** lookup result.

## Generate a VAT declaration from electronic messages

When you use electronic messages to generate the report, you can collect tax data from multiple legal entities. For more information, see the [Run a VAT declaration for multiple legal entities](#run-a-vat-declaration-for-multiple-legal-entities) section later in this topic.

The following procedure applies to the example electronic message processing that you imported earlier from the LCS Shared asset library.

1. Go to **Tax \> Inquiries and reports \> Electronic messages \> Electronic messages**.
2. In the left pane, select **CH VAT declaration**.
3. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **New**, and then, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **OK**.
4. Select the message line that is created, enter a description, and then specify the start and end dates for the declaration.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Steps 5 through 7 are optional.

5. Optional: On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Collect data**, and then select **OK**. The sales tax payments that were generated earlier are added to the message. For more information, see the [Settle and post sales tax](#settle-and-post-sales-tax) section earlier in this topic. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
6. Optional: On the **Message items** FastTab, review the sales tax payments that are transferred for processing. By default, all sales tax payments of the selected period that weren't included in any other message of the same processing are included.
7. Optional: Select **Original document** to review the sales tax payments, or select **Delete** to exclude sales tax payments from processing. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
8. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Update status**. In the **Update status** dialog box, select **Ready to generate**, and then select **OK**. Verify that the message status is changed to **Ready to generate**.
9. Select **Generate report**. To preview the VAT declaration amounts, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **Preview report**, and then select **OK**.
10. In the **Electronic reporting parameters** dialog box, set the following fields, and then select **OK**.

      | **Field**               | **Description**    |
      |-------------------------|---------------------|
      | Settlement period       | Select the settlement period. If you selected **Collect data** in step 5, you can disregard this field. The report will be generated for the sales tax transactions that are included in the collected sales tax payments. |
      | Tax declaration version | Select one of the following values: <br>-**Original**: Generate a report for sales tax transactions of the original sales tax payment or before the sales tax payment is generated. <br>-**Corrections**: Generate a report for sales tax transactions of all the subsequent sales tax payments for the period. <br>- **Total list**: Generate a report for all sales tax transactions for the period, including the original and all corrections.               |
    
    If you selected **Collect data** in step 5, you can disregard this field. The report will be generated for the sales tax transactions that are included in the collected sales tax payments.

11. Select the **Attachments** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select **Open** to open the file. Review the amounts in the Excel document.
12. Select **Generate report**.
13. To generate a VAT declaration in XML format, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **Generate report**, and then select **OK**.
14. In the **Electronic reporting parameters** dialog box, set the fields as described earlier in this procedure, and then select **OK**.
