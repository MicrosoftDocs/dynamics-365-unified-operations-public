Before working in the **Bank management** workspace, you should complete the following procedures to ensure that you have the prerequisites needed for using bank accounts in Russian legal entities.

## Create a bank manually or update information for a bank

1. Go to **Cash and bank management > Setup > Bank groups**.
2. Select a bank or create a new one. 
2. Enter Russia-specific information for the bank.  
   - **BIC** – Bank identification code. 
   - **Corr. Bank account** – Corresponding bank account.
   - **Bank type** – Select either **Main**, **Foreign**, or **Branch**. If you select, **Foreign**, select a **Vendor account** on the **General** FastTab. If you select **Branch**, select a value in the **Main bank** field.
