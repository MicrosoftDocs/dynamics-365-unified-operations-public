For more information, see [Get started with Electronic invoicing service administration](e-invoicing-get-started-service-administration.md).
- Create a configuration provider for your organization. For more information, see [Create a configuration provider and mark them as active](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/tasks/er-configuration-provider-mark-it-active-2016-11.md).

## Import an Electronic invoicing feature from the Microsoft configuration provider

2. In the **Globalization feature** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **Electronic invoicing** tile.
3. Select **Import**, and then select **Synchronize**.
4. Filter the **Configuration provider** column by the term **Microsoft**.
