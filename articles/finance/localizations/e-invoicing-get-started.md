### e-Invoicing feature setup

"The e-Invoicing feature" is the generic name for the resource that is configured and published to consume the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The setup of the e-Invoicing feature combines, among other things, the use of Electronic reporting (ER) configuration formats to create configurable export and import files, and the use of actions and action flows to enable the creation of configurable rules to send requests, import responses, and parse the response contents.

Because of variations in invoice formats and action flows, the e-Invoicing feature setup is country/region-dependent.

## Set up Electronic invoicing add-on integration in Finance or Supply Chain Management 

During this setup, you will complete the following tasks:

1. Open flighted feature
2. Turn on the Electronic invoicing add-on integration feature to enable integration with Finance.
3. Set up the URL of the Electronic invoicing add-on endpoint.
4. Import the ER configurations that are related to the country/region-specific e-Invoicing feature.
5. Turn on the applicable country/region-specific e-Invoicing feature.
6. Import the ER configurations and set up the response types that are required to update your country/region-specific invoice document as a result of the submission process.

### Open flighted feature
The Electronic invoice integration feature is enabled via flighting. Flighting is a concept that allows a feature to be ON or OFF by default. The following steps enable a flight in a non-production environment. 

1. Execute the following SQL command:

    INSERT INTO SYSFLIGHTING (FLIGHTNAME, ENABLED) VALUES ('BusinessDocumentSubmissionServiceEnabled', 1)
    
    INSERT INTO SYSFLIGHTING (FLIGHTNAME, ENABLED) VALUES ('ElectronicInvoicingServiceIntegrationFeature', 1)
    
2. After making the above change, perform an IISReset on all AOS's

### Turn on the Electronic invoicing add-on integration feature

1. Sign in to Finance or Supply Chain Management.
2. In the **Feature management** workspace, search for the new feature, **Configurable Electronic invoicing add-on integration**. If the feature is still not shown in Feature management page, run **Check for updates** function
3. Select the feature, and then select **Enable now**.

### Set up the service endpoint URL

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Setup \> Electronic document parameters**.
2. On the **Submission service** tab, in the **Service endpoint URL** field, enter `https://businessdocumentsubmission.us.operations365.dynamics.com/`.
3. In the **Environment** field, enter the name of the Electronic invoicing add-on environment that you created during RCS setup.

![Entering service parameters](media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-enter-service-endpoint.png)

### Import the ER configurations

To enable business data to be collected and sent to the Electronic invoicing add-on, you must import the ER data model and ER data model configuration
that are related to the country/region-specific e-Invoicing feature that you want to use.

1. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, in the **Configuration providers** section, select the **Microsoft** tile. Make sure that this configuration provider is set to **Active**. For information about how to set a provider to **Active**, see [Create configuration providers and mark them as active](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/tasks/er-configuration-provider-mark-it-active-2016-11).
3. Select **Repositories**.
4. Select **Global resource**, and then select **Open**.
5. In the **Connect to Lifecycle Services** dialog box, select **Click here to connect to Lifecycle Service**.
6. Depending on the country or region where you want to use the e-Invoicing feature, you must import the applicable data model, data model mapping, and formats. For information about the ER configurations that you should import, see the country/region-specific "Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on" topic.
7. Import **Customer invoice context model**. This model contains additional parameters that describe, among other things, the environment in Finance that is used for the Electronic invoicing add-on during the submission of business data.

### <a name="region-specific"></a>Turn on country/region-specific e-Invoicing features

To turn on country/region-specific e-Invoicing features so that they work with the Electronic invoicing add-on, you must turn on the feature in each legal entity where you want to use it. Afterward, the old electronic invoicing integration can no longer be used, and the integration with the new Electronic invoicing add-on is turned on.

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Setup \> Electronic document parameters**.
2. On the **Features** tab, in the row for the feature that is related to your country/region-specific e-Invoicing feature, select the check box in the **Enabled** column. For information about which feature you should turn on, see the country/region-specific "Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on" topic.

![Turning on the e-Invoicing feature](media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-enable-invoicing-feature.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have multiple legal entities that are configured for different countries or regions, you can turn on the country/region-specific e-Invoicing feature for each legal entity.

### Import ER configurations and set up the response types to update your country/region-specific invoice document

If the submitted invoice document requires an update after the response of the submission to the government authorization services, you must import a special ER data model and configurations to enable the status of the invoice document or any other additional field to be updated.

1. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, in the **Configuration providers** section, select the **Microsoft** tile.
2. Select **Repositories**.
3. Select **Global resource**, and then select **Open**.
4. Import **Response message model**, **Response message import format**, **Response message model mapping to destination**, and **File contents import format**.
5. Go to **Organization administration \> Setup \> Electronic document parameters**.
6. On the **Electronic document** tab, select **Add** to enter the name of the table that is related to your country/region-specific invoice document. For information about which table names you should select, see the country/region-specific "Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on" topic.
7. Select **Response types** to configure the response types. For information about which table names you should select, see the country/region-specific "Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on" topic.

## Electronic invoice processing in Finance and Supply Chain Management

During processing, you will complete these tasks:

1. Submit a business document (invoice) through the Electronic invoicing add-on.
2. View the submission execution logs.

### Submit business documents

During the regular submission process, communication between the client and the Electronic invoicing add-on is bidirectional. The purpose is to accomplish two main tasks during submission of electronic documents:

1. Send all electronic documents that are pending submission from Finance, and that have the correct status for submission and meet the selection criteria.
2. Import, into Finance, the response that the Electronic invoicing add-on returns for previously submitted electronic documents. After import, the responses are parsed, and the status of the business documents is updated accordingly.

You can submit business documents either manually or based on your schedule requirements.

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Periodic \> Electronic documents \> Submit electronic documents**.
2. For the first submission of any document, always set the **Resubmit documents** option to **No**. If you must resubmit a document through the service, set this option to **Yes**.
3. On the **Records to include** FastTab, select **Filter** to open the **Inquiry** dialog box, where you can build a query to select documents for submission.

![Submit electronic documents dialog box](media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-submission-form.png)

### Filter query

1. In the **Inquiry** dialog box, on the **Range** tab, enter filter criteria by using the **Table**, **Derived table**, **Field**, and **Criteria** fields.
2. Select **Add** to add as many additional criteria as you require to select the business documents.

    ![Setting up submission filter criteria](media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-set-up-submission-filter-criteria.png)

3. Select **OK** to close the **Inquiry** dialog box.
4. Select **OK** to submit the selected business documents to the Electronic invoicing add-on.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During your first attempt to submit a document through the service, you will be prompted to confirm the connection with the Electronic invoicing add-on. Select **Click here to connect to Electronic Document Submission Service**.

>
> ![Action center messages](media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-view-action-center-messages.png)

### Submission by batch

Instead of manually submitting documents, you can automate the submission process and run it in background, based on a configured frequency of batch execution.

1. In the **Submit electronic documents** dialog box, on the **Run in the background** FastTab, set the **Batch processing** option to **Yes**.
2. On the **Recurrence** tab, configure the batch processing frequency.

![Setting up submission by batch](media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-set-up-submission-batch.png)

### View all submission logs

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Periodic \> Electronic documents \> Electronic document submission log**.
2. In the **Document type** field, select the document type to filter by.

    ![Selecting the type of document to view submission logs for](media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-select-document-type-for-viewing-submission-log.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The value that is shown in the **Submission status** column represents the status that is related to the completion of the submission process itself. It indicates whether the flow of actions that is configured in RCS was run until the end, regardless of whether the electronic document was approved or rejected. The value in the **Submission status** column doesn't represent the status of the submitted document. You can view the status of the submitted document (that is, whether the document was approved or rejected) on the **Processing action log** FastTab in the submission log details, as described next.

3. On the Action Pane, select **Inquiries \> Submission details**.

The results that are shown in the submission log depend on how the e-Invoicing feature was set up in RCS. However, regardless of the setup, the submission log always has three FastTabs:

- **Processing actions** – This FastTab shows the execution log for the actions that are configured in the feature version that was set up in RCS. The **Status** column shows whether the action was successfully run.
- **Action files** – This FastTab shows the intermediate files that were generated during execution of the actions. You can select **View** to download the file and view its contents.
- **Processing action log** – This FastTab shows the results of the communication between the Electronic invoicing add-on and the target web service. It also shows what was returned by the web service processing.
