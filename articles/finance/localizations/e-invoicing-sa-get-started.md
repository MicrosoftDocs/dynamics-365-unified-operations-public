    - Retail fiscal document format (for Retail-specific scenarios, if required)

## Country-specific configuration for the Saudi Arabian electronic invoice (SA) Electronic invoicing feature

Some of the parameters from the **Saudi Arabian electronic invoice (SA)** electronic invoicing feature are published with default values. Before you deploy the electronic invoicing feature to the service environment, review the default values, and update them as required so that they better reflect your business operations.

1. In RCS, in the **Globalization feature** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **Electronic invoicing** tile.
2. On the **Electronic invoicing features** page, verify that the **Saudi Arabian electronic invoice (SA)** Electronic invoicing feature is selected.
3. On the **Versions** tab, verify that the **Draft** version is selected.
4. On the **Configurations** tab, go to **Application specific parameters** for a selected configuration. In the **Lookups** section, make sure that **PaymentMethodSubstitutionLookup** lookup is selected.
5. In the **Conditions** section, select **Add** to add a condition.
6. In the **Name** column for the new condition, select the method of payment that is defined in the application. Then, in the **Lookup result** column, select a standardized method of payment code according to [UN/EDIFACT Code list 4461](https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trade/untdid/d16b/tred/tred4461.htm).
7. Add specific conditions for each method of payment that is defined in the system, and save your changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the **Name** column, you can select the **\*Blank\*** or **\*Not blank\*** placeholder value instead of a specific method of payment.

8. On the **Setups** tab, select **Edit** for the selected configuration. 
9. In the **Processing pipeline** section, turn on the **Export result** option for the **Transform document** action.
10. In Key Vault, create certificates for Cryptographic Stamp Identifiers (CSIDs). For more information, see [Customer certificates and secrets](e-invoicing-customer-certificates-secrets.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your place in the [onboarding](#onboarding) process, create a Compliance CSID (CCSID) or a Production CSID (PCSID).

11. In the **Globalization feature** workspace, select the **Environment setup** related link, and then, on the **Service environments** menu, select the environment to use for the feature deployment.

## Finance configuration

Some parameters must be configured directly in Finance. When tax invoices are cleared by ZATCA, all the required clearance information must be imported back into the system. This information includes digital signatures and QR codes. To achieve this result, you must configure response types in the system. Follow these steps to complete the configuration.

1. Make sure that the country-specific ER configurations that are required for Saudi Arabia are imported. For more information, see [Set up Electronic invoicing parameters](e-invoicing-set-up-parameters.md)

# <a id="onboarding"></a>Electronic invoicing onboarding in Saudi Arabia
Onboarding is mandatory for all taxpayers who are subject to electronic invoicing in Saudi Arabia. Taxpayers and their software for e-invoicing must be onboarded ZATCA. As a result of the onboarding process, taxpayers obtain CSIDs, which are required for integration with the electronic invoicing portal that is managed by ZATCA and for further submission of electronic invoices.

Onboarding is an essential part of the Electronic invoicing configuration. For more information about the onboarding process, see [Electronic invoicing onboarding in Saudi Arabia](e-invoicing-sa-onboarding.md).
