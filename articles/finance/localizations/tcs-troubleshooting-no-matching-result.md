# No matching result could be found

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains the troubleshooting steps that you can take if you receive a "No matching result could be found" error in the Tax Calculation service.

## Symptom

You receive the following error message: "Header/Lines - 1, Tax group, no matching result could be found."

```json
======================Tax service calculation result JSON:===========================
{
    "taxDocument": {
        "Header": [
            {
                "Lines": [
                    {
                        ...
                        "Errors": [
                            {
                                "Code": "TaxSetup20000",
                                "Message": "Header/Lines - 1, Tax group applicability, no matching result could be found."
                            }
                        ],
                        "Adjustment": null
                    }
                ],
                "Measures": {
                    ...
                },
                ...
            }
        ]
    },
    ...
}
```

## Cause

The issue occurs when the feature setup in Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) is incorrect.

## Troubleshoot

1. Download the troubleshooting file. For more information, see [Enable debug mode for troubleshooting](tcs-troubleshooting-enable-debug-mode.md).
2. Compare the Tax service calculation input with the feature setup to fix the setup issue.

    The following example shows the Tax service calculation input.

    ```json
    ===============================Tax service calculation input JSON:=====================================
    {
        "TaxableDocument": {
            "Header": [
                {
                    "Lines": [
                        {
                            ...
                        }
                    ],
                    "Business Process": "Sales",
                    "Ship From Zip Code": "30159",
                }
            ]
        },
        "Parameter": {
            ...
        },
        "Adjustment": {
            "Lines": {}
        }
    }
    ```

    The following table lists the tax group applicability in RCS.

    | Header.Business process | Lines.Business Unit | Header.Ship From Zip Code | Tax Group |
    |-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
    | Journal                 |                     |                           | Group A   |
    | Sales                   |                     | 30160                     | Group B   |

    According to the Tax service calculation input, the **Business Process** value on the header is **Sales**, and the **Ship From Zip Code** value on the header is **30159**. This input is based on the setup of applicability rules in RCS. Because there is no matching line, the error occurs.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the value in the applicability rule is blank, the rule is applicable to any value.

## Mitigation

Follow these steps to mitigate the error.

1. In RCS, go to **Globalization features** \> **Tax calculation**.
2. Create a new version of the feature.
3. Add a line for the corresponding information.

    | Header.Business process | Lines.Business Unit | Header.Ship From Zip Code| Tax Group |
    |-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
    | Journal                 |                     |                          | Group A   |
    | Sales                   |                     | 30160                    | Group B   |
    | Sales                   |                     | 30159                    | Group B   |

4. Publish the feature setup version.
5. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Tax configuration** \> **Tax calculation parameters**, and select the new version.
