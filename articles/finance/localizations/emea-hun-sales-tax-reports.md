# Sales tax reports for Hungary

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the **Sales tax declaration information** and **Itemized VAT statement** reports. You can generate these Microsoft Excel reports and use them to create the value-added tax (VAT) returns that must be submitted to the tax authorities.

- **Sales tax declaration information** – This report includes a list of invoices that are grouped by sales tax direction (sales tax receivable, sales tax payable, or use tax) and by sales tax code. For each sales tax direction and sales tax code, the report also includes the total sales tax amount and total gross invoice amount.
- **Itemized VAT statement** – This report includes the total number of invoices, total number of counteragents (partners), total VAT base, and total VAT amount for each item in the following table.

  | **Item number** | **Transactions that are included**            |
  |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | 01              | Sales invoices                                |
  | 02              | Credit note sales orders                      |
  | 04              | Purchases invoices                            |
  | 05              | Credit note purchase orders                   |
  | 06              | Purchase invoices that don't exceed the limit |

This report also includes the same information for each partner separately, and a list of invoices for each item.

## Setup

1. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2), in the Shared asset library, download the latest versions of the following Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the report format:

   * **Sales tax declaration info Itemized Excel format (HU)**
   * **Sales tax declaration info report format (HU)**

    For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

2. Go to **General ledger** \> **Ledger setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
3. On the **Sales tax** tab, on the **VAT statement** FastTab, set the **Enable to print itemized VAT statement** option to **Yes** to use the **Sales tax declaration info Itemized Excel format (HU) ER format and generate the Itemized VAT statement report**.

   Alternatively, set the option to **No** to use the **Sales tax declaration info report format (HU) ER format and generate the Sales tax declaration information** report.

4. If you set the **Enable to print itemized VAT statement option to Yes**, in the **Itemized VAT statement limit (HUF)** field, enter an amount limit in Hungarian forints (HUF). This field determines which invoice transactions will be included in the **Itemized VAT statement** report. Any invoice where the VAT amount exceeds the value of this field will be included.
