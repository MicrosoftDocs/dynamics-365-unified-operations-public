## Posting packing slips and shipping transfer orders that include the Waybill (Carta de Porte) complement

If you select **Enable CFDI packing slip** on the **Packing slip posting** or **Shipment** page, the **Generate transportation note** parameter is automatically selected. However, you can clear this parameter as you require. If **Generate transportation note** is selected, the Waybill (Carta de Porte) complement will be included in the XML file.

## Setup

### Catalogs

Follow these steps to set up the Mexican tax authorities (SAT) catalogs to add information to the **Permission type**, **Trailer type**, and **Federal motor transport configuration** fields.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **EInvoice** \> **SAT classification** \> **Transportation**.
2. On the **Transportation** page, create the following SAT catalogs:

    - For the **Trailer type** field, the SAT catalog is **c\_SubTipoRem**.
    - For the **Permission type** field, the SAT catalog is **c\_TipoPermiso**.
    - For the **Federal motor transport configuration** field, the SAT catalog is **c\_ConfigAutotransporte**.

### Permission number

2. Select and open the item record that you want to work with.
3. On the **Manage inventory** FastTab, set the **Net weight** and **Tare weight** fields if they are required. The **Gross weight** field is automatically set.

### Distance and time

You can define information about the distance and transportation time between shipment delivery locations in advance. Then, when users enter distance and transportation time on the **Transportation details** page, they can save time by selecting existing values instead of having to calculate new values. Follow these steps to set up information about the distance and transportation time between transportation spots.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **EInvoice**.
2. On the **EInvoice** page, enter or select transportation spots.

    - Customer
    - Warehouse
    - Border (if goods are delivered to border)
    - Other

> [!NOTE] 
> You can skip this procedure. However, in that case, you must manually enter the distance and transportation time on the **Transportation details** page.

### Fixed assets

If your company has implemented the **Fixed assets** module, enter information in the fixed asset record for vehicles or trailers. This information can then be used on the **Transportation details** page. This information is required for the Waybill (Carta de Porte) complement.

1. Go to **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.
2. On the **Technical information** FastTab, set the following fields:

        - **Model year**
        - **Serial number**

### Workers

Follow these steps to enter RFC numbers, registration numbers, and license information for drivers. Before you start, make sure that identification types have been set up at **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Identification types**.

1. Go to **Human resources** \> **Workers** \> **Employees/Contractors/Workers**.
