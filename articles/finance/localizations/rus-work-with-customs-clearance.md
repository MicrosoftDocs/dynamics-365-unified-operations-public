# Work with customs clearance

The registration of the customs clearance process is done in two new journals: the customs journal and the KTS journal. In these journals, information about the composition of the cargo customs declaration (GTD) or the customs value correction (KTS) is shown, customs payments are calculated based on the transaction amount or indicative price of products, and factures of the **GTD** or **KTS** type are registered.

The form that a customs journal takes when it's created depends on whether the products are imported or exported, and on the delivery conditions that determine the moment of the transfer of ownership (either before or after the customs clearance process).

For an import journal where the transfer of ownership occurs after the customs clearance process, purchase orders must be registered. The lines of the customs journal are generated based on inventory transactions that have a status of **Ordered**. After a customs journal or KTS journal is posted, the amounts of customs duties and fees adjust the cost of products or are debited to the expense account, depending on the parameters of the journal. Transactions are generated for the amount of value-added tax (VAT), excise, and debt to the customs service provider. Adjustment of the cost price for the amount of duties and fees occurs in two iterations: a transaction is generated in the transit account when the customs journal is posted, and a cost adjustment transaction is generated when a purchase order invoice is posted. In the inventory transactions, the analytics of the **GTD number** value are registered, and the status of the inventory transactions is changed to **Registered**.

For an import journal where the transfer of ownership occurs before the customs clearance process, invoices for purchase orders must be registered. The lines of the customs journal are generated based on inventory transactions that have a status of **Purchased**. After a customs journal or KTS journal is posted, the amounts of customs duties and fees adjust the cost of products or are debited to the expense account, depending on the parameters of the journal. Transactions are generated for the amount of VAT, excise, and debt to the customs service provider. In the inventory transactions, the analytics of the **GTD number** value are registered.

For an export journal where the transfer of ownership occurs after the customs clearance process, invoices for purchase orders of the **Postponed passing of property** posting type must be registered. The lines of the customs journal are generated based on inventory transactions that have a status of **Deducted** or **Sold**. After a customs journal or KTS journal is posted, the amounts of customs duties and fees are debited to the expense account. The debt to the customs service provider is also generated.

For an export journal where the transfer of ownership occurs before the customs clearance process, invoices for purchase orders of the **Standard** posting type must be registered. The lines of the customs journal are generated based on inventory transactions that have a status of **Deducted** or **Sold**. After a customs journal or KTS journal is posted, the amounts of customs duties and fees are debited to the expense account. The debt to the customs service provider is also generated.

## Create and set up a customs journal

    - On the **Financial dimensions** tab, you can view financial information about the line that is defined from the line of the linked purchase order, invoice, sales order, or packing slip line.

To create a new line, follow these steps.

1. On the **Customs journal lines** FastTab, select **Create lines**.

    The following table shows the inventory transactions that are available for creating customs journal lines.

    | Customs journal type | Conditions | Source | Inventory transaction status |
    |----------------------|------------|--------|------------------------------|
    | Import | The value of the **Receipt transactions status** field in the terms of delivery is **Ordered**. | Purchase order | **Ordered** |
    | Import | The value of the **Receipt transactions status** field in the terms of delivery is **Purchased**. | Purchase order invoice | **Purchased** |
    | Export | The posting type is **Standard**. | Packing slip for a sales order | **Deducted** or **Sold** |
    | Export | The posting type is **Postponed passing of property**. | Sales order invoice of the **Deferred transfer of ownership** posting type | **Deducted** or **Sold** |

    The **Create customs journal lines** dialog box consists of two main parts:

    - **Upper** – The upper part of the page shows the source of the payment. The view depends on the value of the **Log type** field. For the **Import** journal type, it depends on the terms of the transfer of ownership that are reflected in the terms of delivery. For the **Export** journal type, it depends on the terms of the transfer of ownership that are reflected in the posting type. Filters are applied to this part of the page. The **Invoice account** field is set to the same account as the **Partner code** field on the customs journal header. If the **Agreement ID** field on the customs journal header is set to a value (that is, it isn't blank), orders and invoices that have the same agreement ID are shown. If the **Agreement ID** field is blank, all orders and invoices of the partner are shown.
    - **Lower** – The lower part of the page shows the quantity of products that are available for selection according to the warehouse transaction that is associated with the purchase order line, supplier's invoice, customer's packing slip, or customer's invoice. The following conditions must be met:

        - For the **Import** journal type, the GTD number isn't specified in the warehouse transaction.
        - For the **Export** journal type, the warehouse transaction isn't included in another customs journal.
        - The source of the transaction isn't a credit note.
        - The status of the warehouse transaction matches the type of the customs journal and the terms of the transfer of ownership.
        - For the **Export** journal type, the lines have a sales tax code where the **Type of tax** field is set to **VAT 0%** and the **Tax code for domestic market** field is set to a value (that is, it isn't blank).

2. Mark the required lines. Additionally, in the **Selected quantity** field, you can change the quantity to include in the customs journal.
3. Select **OK**.

    ![Create customs journal lines dialog box.](media/9e93327dc79cc0f3f442cc7c875dc54b.png)

4. Optional: To recalculate the journal lines, on the Action Pane, select **Manage** \> **Recalculate lines**. For example, if you created journal lines and then changed the indicative prices for those products, you should recalculate the lines so that the actual information in the customs journal is used.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > For a journal that has a status of **In Progress**, you can create and change lines as many times as you require.

5. If you created lines for a journal of the **Export** type, information about including a warehouse transaction in the customs journal is added to the source. In the **Grouping reference type** field, you should see a value of **Custom journal line** or **Customs journal line (goods in transit)**. In the **Grouping reference** field, you should see the packing slip or invoice number.

When you calculate the import overhead cost, the settings of the charges code for customs payments are also analyzed in addition to the order cost. The amount of the overhead charges that have been registered for the purchase order or invoice, and that have been configured for the value of the **Delivery terms** field on the customs journal header, is added to the invoice cost on the line.

> [!NOTE]
> If overhead expenses were set in the purchase order, they must be allocated.

After you post the customs journal, you can add only overhead expenses that don't increase the customs cost of the products on the purchase order line or invoice line from the customs journal. In other words, you can add only overhead expenses that aren't related to the delivery condition from the customs journal header.

The values of customs payments (VAT, duty, and excise) are calculated based on the settings on the **TN VED code relation with customs payment** page. You can correct the **VAT** and **Excise** fields in the **Import invoice amount** and **Indicative amount** sections on the **Line details** FastTab. In this case, the **Manually correction** option is set to **Yes** on the customs journal header.

The duty is calculated for the section and distributed to the lines, based on the value of the **Complex rate** field for the sales tax code. If the value isn't set to **Summation**, the distribution is done in proportion to the cost. If the value is set to **Maximum**, the distribution is done in proportion to the weight, quantity, or volume, based on the value of the **Method of duty calculation** field.

### Calculate customs fees for issuance, storage, and escort

#### Calculate customs fees for issuance

The customs fee for issuance is automatically calculated based on the type of customs journal, the customs value, and the value that is specified in the settings of the tax code for the customs fee for issuance.

    The GTD is issued, and the status of the journal is changed to the **Issued**.

    - For journals of the **Import** type, the GTD number is generated for all products of the customs journal, and the warehouse operations are updated based on the type of journal and the conditions for the transfer of ownership.

        - If the transfer of ownership occurs before the products cross the customs border, the **Warehouse change** option is set to **Yes** when a customs journal is generated. A warehouse journal that has a status of **Transfer** is generated. The value of the **Inventory profile** field and information about the warehouse are updated according to the customs journal header. The GTD number is added to the description of the transfer journal. If the quantity on the warehouse transaction line exceeds the quantity in the customs journal, the inventory transaction is split. The GTD number is entered in the transaction that is associated with the customs journal.
        - If the transfer of ownership occurs after the products cross the customs border, the GTD number is entered on the purchase order or sale order lines. The status of warehouse transactions in purchase orders is changed to **Registered**. If the quantity on the order line exceeds the quantity on the customs journal line, the purchase order line is split, and the GTD number on the created line is entered based on the quantity that is specified on the customs journal line. If miscellaneous charges have been entered for the line that must be split, they are split in proportion to the quantity.

    - For export delivery invoices, the export date is updated with the value of the GTD issue date.

There are multiple algorithms for generating transactions. Here are some examples:

- Formation of debt to the customs counteragent
- Formation of transactions for VAT and excise
- Formation of transactions for duties and fees

#### Formation of debt to the customs counteragent

Depending on the value of the **Vendor of customs services** field on the customs journal header, debt transactions are generated either for the customs authority that is specified in the **Customs code** field or for the broker that is specified in the **Broker code** field.

#### Formation of transactions for VAT and excise

For journals of the **Import** type, VAT and excise tax transactions are generated based on the settings of the corresponding sales tax codes. Debit and credit accounts are defined in the following way.

| Type | Debit | Credit |
|------|-------|--------|
| VAT/Excise | The account is defined by the **Sales tax receivable** field in the ledger postings group for the tax code that is defined as **VAT, Excise** on the **TN VED code relation with customs payment** page. | The account is defined by the **Posting profile** field on the customs journal header, based on the posting profile for the customs service provider. |

#### Formation of transactions for duties and fees

The formation of transactions for customs duties and fees depends on the setting of the **Include to the cost price** option on the customs journal header and the conditions for the transfer of ownership.

##### Import journal type

For the **Import** journal type, if the **Include to the cost price** option is set to **Yes**, and the transfer of ownership occurs before the customs clearance process, cost correction transactions are generated for duty and fees. Debit and credit accounts are defined in the following way.

| Duty/Fee | The account is the account of the receipt of the product, considering the value of the **Inventory profile** field on the customs journal header. | The account is defined by the **Posting profile** field on the customs journal header, based on the posting profile for the customs service provider. |

If the **Include to the cost price** option is set to **Yes**, and the transfer of ownership occurs after the customs clearance process, invoice lines are generated for duty and fees. You can't edit or delete missed charge data on purchase order lines. When you post a customs journal, a transaction is generated in a transit account. Debit and credit accounts are defined in the following way.

| Type | Debit | Credit |
|------|-------|--------|
| Duty | The general ledger account is determined based on the **Account** field for the **Credit** section of the **Ledger account** type (when a charges code is created) for the overhead expense of the duty type. | The account is defined  by the **Posting profile** field on the customs journal header, based on the posting profile for the customs service provider. |
| Fee | The general ledger account is determined based on the **Account** field for the **Credit** section of the **Ledger account** type (when a charges code is created) for the overhead expense that has the same type as the corresponding customs fee. | The account is defined by the **Posting profile** field on the customs journal header, based on the posting profile for the customs service provider. |

After the invoice is posted, product cost adjustment transactions are made from the transit account.

| Type | Debit | Credit |
|------|-------|--------|
| Duty | The account is the account of the receipt of the product, considering the value of the **Inventory profile** field on the customs journal header. | The general ledger account is determined based on the **Account** field for the **Credit** section of the **Ledger account** type (when a charges code is created) for the overhead expense of the duty type. |
| Fee | The account is the account of the receipt of the product, considering the value of the **Inventory profile** field on the customs journal header. | The general ledger account is determined based on the **Account** field for the **Credit** section of the **Ledger account** type (when a charges code is created) for the overhead expense that has the same type as the corresponding customs fee. |

If the **Include to the cost price** option is set to **No**, and the transfer of ownership occurs either before or after the customs clearance process, transactions for duty and fees are generated in the expense account. Debit and credit accounts are defined in the following way.

| Type | Debit | Credit |
|------|-------|--------|
| Duty | The account is defined based on the value of the **Sales tax receivable** field of the ledger posting group for the tax code that is defined as customs duty in the **Customs duty** field when the customs payment relation with TN VED is set up. | The account is defined by the **Posting profile** field on the customs journal header, based on the posting profile for the customs service provider. |
| Fee | The account is defined based on the value of the **Sales tax receivable** field of the ledger posting group for the tax code that is selected when the escort, storage, and import issuance fees are calculated. | The account is defined by the **Posting profile** field on the customs journal header, based on the posting profile for the customs service provider. |
