If your organization uses electronic invoices that are validated and certified by a third-party digital signature service provider (PAC), enable electronic invoicing by using the fields in the **CFDI** area of the **Electronic invoice parameters** page.

To work with version 4.0, set the following values for the electronic invoice parameters:

- On the **Electronic invoice parameters** page, in the **CFDI version** field, select **4.0**.
- On the **CFDI** tab, in the **CFDI XML scheme file** and **CFDI Payment XML schema file** fields, select a new XML scheme file.
- On the **CFDI withholding** tab, in the **CFDI XML scheme file** field, select a new XML scheme file.
- Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Customers**, and then, on the **Invoice and delivery** FastTab, in the **Electronic invoices** section, enter the tax regime for customers.

For a temporary export, open the customer record, and then, on the **Invoice and delivery** tab, set the **Temporary export** option to **Yes**. This setting is used as a default value for related sales orders or free text invoices.

When you post a vendor invoice, you can add a Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDI) reference to the related invoice by selecting **Attachments** \> **CFDI reference**.

If the **Withholding type** field in the purchase order line details has a value of **28**, the two new fields, **Bimonthly profit amount** and **ISR corresponding amount**, are included in the details of the CFDI withholding journal. Enter a value in these two fields. The corresponding attributes are then set in the XML file.
