# Use LATAM functionality for checks 

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to use LATAM functionality for specific check operations, such as the accrual of your company's own checks, deposits of third-party checks, cancellations, and re-entries.

## Prerequisites

Before you complete the procedures in this article, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Enable the **LATAM** globalization feature with a valid country/region.
- Create a document class for each payment method.
- Go to **General ledger** \> **Ledger setup** \> **General ledger parameters**. On the **Ledger** tab, select the option to allow multiple transactions in one voucher.

## Accrue checks that are provided by your company

Follow these steps to accrue checks that are provided by your company.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Journal entries** \> **General journals**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
3. In the **Name** field, select an accrual journal.
4. On the Action Pane, select **Lines**.
5. On the **Journal** page, on the Action Pane, select **LATAM**, and then select **Payment methods**.
6. On the **Payment methods** page, in the **Action** field, select **Accrual action**.
7. In the **Document class Id** field, select a document class ID for the check type.
8. Select one or more checks, and then close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> After you close the page, confirm the selection in the verification message. After you select checks on the **Payment methods** page, lines are automatically created. The number of lines matches the number of selected checks.

### Review a transaction in a vendor's account

To determine the impact of accruals on transactions that occur with a vendor, go to **Accounts payable** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**. Select and open the vendor record that you want to review, and select the **Transaction** tab.

If the check was previously listed as pending with the vendor, it's now settled with the accrual transaction. This process is automatic.

## Cancel checks

If you must cancel (void) checks that are provided by your company, regardless of whether they're accrued, follow these steps.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Journal entries** \> **General journals**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
3. In the **Name** field, select a general journal.
4. On the Action Pane, select **Lines**.
5. On the **Journal** page, on the Action Pane, select **LATAM**, and then select **Payment methods**.
6. On the **Payment methods** page, in the **Action** field, select **Cancelation**.
7. In the **Document class Id** field, select a document class ID for the check type.
8. Select one or more checks in either the **Open book** section (for the pending accrual of issued checks) or the **History book** section (for accrued checks).
9. Close the page.
