# Configure Format 1005 file for Colombia

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to configure and generate the Format 1005 file. The report shows deductible VAT for purchases and sales returns. It outputs an XML file that meets official tax requirements and an Excel file for internal control.

## Prerequisites

Before you print the report, make sure these prerequisites are met:

- Make sure the legal entity has an address in a country/region in the Latin American (LATAM) localization.
- Turn on the country/region-specific LATAM feature and the general feature.
- Import the following configurations from Dataverse:

| Element | Format name |
|---------|-------------|
| Model | :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report"::: |
| Mapping | :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report mapping"::: |
| Format | :::no-loc text="File format 1005"::: |
| Format | :::no-loc text="File format 1005 (Excel)"::: |

For more information, see [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).

- Configure Electronic reporting (ER) parameters. For more information, see [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).

## Configure tax application codes

Set up a tax application ID to run Form 1005 reports in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations.

* Go to **Organization Administration** > **Settings** > **LATAM** > **Tax Application**. Select **New** and create a record with code **1005**. 

Configure the tax application code for each **Tax Id Type**.
* Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **LATAM** > **Tax ID type**. For each record, select **Tax application** on the top menu and create a new record with the appropriate tax application code based on fiscal regulations.

Correct setup of these tax application codes lets the report reflect taxable operations and comply with DIAN requirements.
