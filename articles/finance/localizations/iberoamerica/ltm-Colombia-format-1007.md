# Format 1007 file for Colombia configuration

This article explains how to configure and issue a file in 1007 format. This format records for each third party the income received by a natural or legal person during the taxable year including both operating and nonoperating income.

> [!NOTE]
> The XML output format covers the fiscal requirements. The Excel output format is for management purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before generating and printing the report, complete the following prerequisites:

- The country/region of the legal entity's address is Colombia. 
- Enable the country/region-specific Latin American (LATAM) feature for Colombia and the general LATAM feature.
- Download the specific report configurations from the Dataverse configuration repository:

| Element |                    Format name                    |
|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| Model   |:::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report":::                 |
| Mapping | :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report mapping":::|
| Format  | :::no-loc text="File format 1007:::      |
| Format  | :::no-loc text="File format 1007 (Excel)":::  |
