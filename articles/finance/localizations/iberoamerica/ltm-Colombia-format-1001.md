# Format 1001 file for Colombia issue configuration

This article explains how to set up and configure information so that you can issue a format 1001 file. The **Format 1001 file** report provides a list of expenses that were paid to third parties, and the taxes and withholding taxes that those transactions generated.

## Prerequisites

    - LTM Tax Report
    - Format 1001 file

    For more information, see [Download ER configurations from the Global repository of Configuration service](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).
