# Create customer and vendor records with an address in Nicaragua

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The Nicaraguan customer and vendor configuration contains the fiscal information that's required by the fiscal authorities. The configuration also includes a reference to the document classes that can be used in transactions with customers and vendors.

## Prerequisites

Before you create records for customers and vendors who are located in Nicaragua, the following setup must be completed:

- Address formats that are specific to Nicaragua. These formats must use states for departments and counties for counties.
- Tax codes for the value-added tax (VAT) that will be used (VAT general rate, exempt, and so on).
- Sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that were created.
- Item sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that were created.
- Document classes to use with customer and vendor invoices, credit notes, debit notes, packing slips, and so on. For more information, see [Configure sales and purchase invoices for Nicaragua](ltm-configure-invoices-nicaragua.md).
- A customer and vendor set that contains all the document classes that will be used.
- A tax ID for each type of tax identification that your customers and suppliers have.
- A taxpayer type for each type of taxpayer that your customers and suppliers have.
