[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to configure and use the Latin American (LATAM) withholding functionality in Dynamics 365 Finance to support scenarios where tax withholdings are calculated at the time of vendor payments.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the LATAM Withholding tax engine configuration, meet the following prerequisites:

- The legal entity's address is in a country/region from the LATAM Globalization expansion.
- Enable both the general LATAM feature and the country/region-specific LATAM feature for the country/region selected in the legal entity address.
- Configure document classes as invoices. Learn more in [Document classes for Latin America](ltm-core-document-class.md).
- Configure sales tax codes. 
- Configure the LATAM section of vendors.

## Configure the LATAM withholding tax engine

1. In the **Values** section, configure scales that affect how the withholding taxes are calculated:

   |     Field    |                                                                         Description                                                                         |

   | From Amount  | Set the taxable amount from which the percentage configured is calculated.                                                                             |
   | To Amount    | Set the taxable amount to which the percentage configured is calculated.                                                                               |
   | Fixed Amount | Set the amount that is deducted from each line of the scale. The withholding is calculated on the excess between the base amount and this amount. |
   | Percentage   | Set the withholding tax rate.                                                                                                                               |
   | Over amount  | Set the minimum amount to be calculated. It is deducted from the base amount.                                                                          |

1. In the **Document class** section, determine the document classes on which withholding taxes are calculated. Add the document classes that calculate withholding taxes. If you don't list a document class here, it isn't included in the calculation.

### Configure a withholding tax group

The **Withholding tax group** defines the withholding tax codes that the system calculates in a vendor transaction.

To configure a withholding tax group, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Tax** > **Indirect taxes** > **Withholding tax** > **Withholding tax groups** and create a new record. Enter a group ID and a description. 
1. In the **Configuring** section, add the withholding tax codes for the group.
1. In the LATAM section, enter the role, country/region, state, and taxpayer type that the group applies to.
1. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Vendors** > **All vendors** and assign a group in the **Withholding tax group** field from the **Invoice and delivery** section. This step sets the withholding tax group for each vendor transaction.
