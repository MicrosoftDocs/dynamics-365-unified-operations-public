# Create customer and vendor records with an address in Panama

The Panamanian customer and vendor configuration contains the fiscal information that's required by the fiscal authorities. The configuration also includes a reference to the document classes that can be used in transactions with customers and vendors.

## Prerequisites

Before you create records for customers and vendors who are located in Panama, the following setup must be completed:

- Address formats that are specific to Panama. These formats must use states for regions, counties for provinces, and cities for communes.
- Tax codes for the moveable goods and services transfer tax (ITBMS) that will be used (ITBMS general rate, exempt, and so on).
- Sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that were created.
- Item sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that were created.
- Document classes to use with customer and vendor invoices, credit notes, debit notes, packing slips, and so on. For more information, see [Configure sales and purchase invoices for Panama](ltm-configure-invoices-panama.md).
- A customer and vendor set that contains all the document classes that will be used.
- A tax ID for each type of tax identification that your customers and suppliers have.
- A taxpayer type for each type of taxpayer that your customers and suppliers have.
