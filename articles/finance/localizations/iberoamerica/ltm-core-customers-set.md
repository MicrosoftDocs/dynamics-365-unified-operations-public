You can define which document classes are allowed in transactions with customers. You can also define the predetermined document classes for transactions with specific customers.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up a customer set, the document classes that will be included must already exist.

## Set up a customer set

Follow these steps to set up a customer set.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Customers set**.
2. In the **Customers set** section, set the following fields:
 
    - **Customer/Vendor** – Select whether the register belongs to a customer.
    - **Customers/Vendors set** – Enter a unique code for the set that you're creating.
    - **Description** – Enter a brief description of the set that you're creating.

3. In the **Authorized voucher** grid, select the document classes for the set.
4. In the **Default vouchers** section, set the default field values that should be entered for the selected document classes when the customer is used in a transaction.
