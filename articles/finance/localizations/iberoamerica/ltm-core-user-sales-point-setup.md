This article explains how to set up a predefined sales point for each user. This feature ensures that when a user posts a document with LATAM information and has multiple sales points available, the form selects the sales point assigned to the user by default.

> [!NOTE]
> This form only allows one sales point per user. You can't assign multiple sales points to a user.

## Prerequisites

Before you complete this form, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Enable the country/region-specific Latin American (LATAM) feature, and the general LATAM feature.
- Set the company's address to a country/region within the LATAM Globalization expansion.

## Predefine a sales point to a user

To assign a sales point to a user, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Organization administration > Setup > LATAM > User's sales point set up**.
1. To add a record, select **New** from the action pane.
1. In the **User ID** field, select a user.
1. In the **Sales point** field, select a value.
1. Add all the required users and sales points.
1. Select **Save** from the action pane.
