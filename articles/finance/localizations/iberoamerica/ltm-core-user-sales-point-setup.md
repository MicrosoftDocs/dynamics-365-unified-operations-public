# Set up predefined sales point per user

This article explains how to set up a predefined sales point for each user.
This feature will ensure that when a user is posting a document with LATAM information and has multiple sales points available, the one assigned to the user in this form will be selected by default.

## Prerequisites

Before you can complete this form make sure the following prerequisites are met:
