Before you can enable the LATAM configuration, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Enable the **LATAM** globalization feature with a valid country/region.
- Activate the **LATAM taxes** feature in the LATAM parameters.
- Create at least one journal name.

## LATAM configuration of journal names

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Journal setup** \> **Journal names**.
1. Select an existing journal name, or create a new one.
1. In the **General** section, enter the required information.
