# Additional authorization code for Latin America

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure and use the additional authorization code feature in the LATAM extension. 

This functionality adds a field named **Additional CA** in the **Sales CA** form located in the **Document class sales point** configuration. You can customize the information in this field to meet your requirements.
