[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The Latin American (LATAM) customer and vendor configuration contains the fiscal information that's required by the fiscal authorities. In addition, it includes a reference to the document classes that can be used in transactions with customers and vendors.

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure records for customers and vendors who have an address in Chile, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Create regions, provinces, and communes in Chile by using states, counties, and cities in the address setup.
- Create the tax codes that will be used for value-added tax (VAT), including IVA 19, IVA exento, IVA no afecto, and Retenciones.
- Create sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that you created.
- Create item sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that you created.
- Create document classes to use with customers and vendors for invoices, credit notes, debit notes, and packing slips. For more information, see [Configure sales and purchase invoices](ltm-chile-configure-sales-purchase-invoices.md).
- Create a customer and vendor set that contains all the document classes that will be used.
