# Create customer and vendor records with an address in Chile

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The Latin American (LATAM) customer and vendor configuration contains the fiscal information that the fiscal authorities require. In addition, it includes a reference to the document classes that you can use in transactions with customers and vendors.

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure records for customers and vendors who have an address in Chile, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- Create regions, provinces, and communes in Chile by using states, counties, and cities in the address setup.

  > [!NOTE]
  > For Chile addresses, LATAM reports and e-invoice formats use the county as a "Comuna" and the city as "Ciudad."

- Create the tax codes that you use for value-added tax (VAT), including IVA 19, IVA exento, IVA no afecto, and Retenciones.
- Create sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that you created.
- Create item sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that you created.
- Create document classes to use with customers and vendors for invoices, credit notes, debit notes, and packing slips. For more information, see [Configure sales and purchase invoices](ltm-chile-configure-sales-purchase-invoices.md).
- Create a customer and vendor set that contains all the document classes that you use.
- Create the **RUT** tax ID type. (RUT is short for "Registro Ãšnico Tributario.")
- Create the **Persona Juridica** taxpayer type.
