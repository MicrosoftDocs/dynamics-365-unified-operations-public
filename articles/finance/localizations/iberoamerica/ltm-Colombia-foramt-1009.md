# Set up format 1009 file for Colombia

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Set up and issue the format 1009 file. The format 1009 file shows the company's liabilities for a reporting period.

The output includes two files: an XML file that meets official tax requirements and an Excel file for internal control.

## Prerequisites

Before you print the report, make sure these prerequisites are met:

- Set the legal entity address to a country/region in the Latin American (LATAM) localization.
- Enable the country/region-specific Latin American (LATAM) globalization feature and the general LATAM feature.
- Import the following configurations from Dataverse:

| Element | Format name |
|---------|-------------|
| Model | :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report"::: |
| Mapping | :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report mapping"::: |
| Format | :::no-loc text="File format 1009"::: |
| Format | :::no-loc text="File format 1009 Excel"::: |

## Configure tax application codes

To run the Form 1009 report in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations by setting up a tax application, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Tax application** and select **New** to create a tax application record with code **1009** for format 1009.
1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Tax ID type**.
1. For each record, select it, then select **Tax application**.
1. On the **Tax application** page, in the **Tax application id** field, enter the code for Colombian format 1009.
1. In the **Tax application code** field, enter the tax ID code according to Colombian regulation.
1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Global address book** \> **Addresses** \> **Address setup**. For each record (Country/Region, State, and County), go to **LATAM** \> **Tax application** to assign the tax application codes according to Colombian regulation.

Set up these tax application codes correctly so the report reflects taxable operations and complies with DIAN requirements.
