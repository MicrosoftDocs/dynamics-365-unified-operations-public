# Configure printing for the Withholding certificate format for Colombia

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and generate three withholding certificate formats for Colombia in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance: VAT withholdings, income withholdings, and ICA withholdings.

It includes information from vendor transactions like invoices, debit notes, and credit notes, and it shows the calculated withholdings for income tax (FTE), industry and commerce tax (ICA), and value-added tax (IVA). These certificates are official documents for the amounts withheld and reported to the DIAN. They ensure fiscal transparency and legal compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before generating the report, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The legal entity's address must be in Colombia.
- Enable the general Latin American (LATAM) feature, and the country/region-specific LATAM feature for Colombia.
- Download the specific report configuration from the Dataverse configuration repository. For more information, see [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).

- Download these formats from Dataverse:
  - :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report":::
  - :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report mapping":::
  - :::no-loc text="COL Withholding Certificate FTE":::
  - :::no-loc text="COL Withholding Certificate ICA":::
  - :::no-loc text="COL Withholding Certificate IVA":::
