# Configure format 1012 file for Colombia

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Set up and issue a format 1012 file. The file lists company investments you provide to the tax authority. The process outputs two files: an XML file that meets official tax requirements, and an Excel file for internal control.

## Prerequisites

Before you print the report, meet these prerequisites:

- Set the legal entity address to a location in Colombia.
- Enable the country-specific Latin American (LATAM) globalization feature and the general LATAM feature.
- Import these configurations from Dataverse:

| Element |                    Format name                    |
|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| Model   |:::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report":::                 |
| Mapping | :::no-loc text="LTM Tax Report mapping":::|
| Format  | :::no-loc text="File format 1012":::      |
| Format  | :::no-loc text="File format 1012 Excel":::  |

- Set up Electronic reporting (ER) parameters. For more information, see [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).

## Configure tax application codes

Run the Form 1012 report in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations by setting up a **Tax Application ID**.

To set up a Tax Application ID, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Tax application**, and select **New** to create a tax application record with code **1012** for format 1012.
1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Tax ID type**.
1. Select a record, and then select **Tax application**.

To configure codes for **Tax ID types**, follow these steps.

1. On the **Tax application** page, in the **Tax application id** field, enter the code for Colombian format 1012.
1. In the **Tax application code** field, enter the tax ID code according to Colombian regulation.

To configure codes for countries, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Global address book** \> **Addresses** \> **Address setup**, and for each country/region go to **LATAM** \> **Tax application** to assign the tax application codes according to Colombian regulation.

Proper setup of these tax application codes helps the report reflect taxable operations and comply with DIAN requirements.

1. In **Main account**, select the ledger account for the concept.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The ledger accounts that are selected in this configuration must be used in the company transactions that are included in the report.

1. In the **Lookups** section, select the second lookup, **PaymentMethodId**. This lookup refers to the payment method document class used to post transactions for each concept in the **MainAccountGroup** lookup.
1. In the **Conditions** section, add a line, then in **Lookup result**, select **PaymentMethodClass**.
1. In the **Document classification Id** field, select the document class used in the transactions included in the report.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For each **Lookup**, add two conditions where the **Lookup result** is **N/A** for both. The **Main account ID** for the first condition should be **"Blank"** and the Main account ID** for the second condition should be **"Not blank"**. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The lookup settings must be applied to both formats to be used.
