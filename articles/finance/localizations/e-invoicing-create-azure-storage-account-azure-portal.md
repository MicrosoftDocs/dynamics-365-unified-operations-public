# Create an Azure storage account in the Azure portal

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

All electronic files that are generated by the Electronic invoicing service or go to the service during processing are stored in your Microsoft Azure storage account containers. To ensure that Electronic invoicing can access those containers, you must provide the shared access signature (SAS) token of the storage account to the Electronic invoicing service. Additionally, to ensure that the token is securely stored, don't provide the SAS token directly. Instead, store it in an Azure key vault, and provide an Azure Key Vault secret.

1. Open the storage account that you plan to use with the Electronic invoicing service.
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Configuration**, and make sure that the **Allow Blob public access** parameter is set to **Enabled**.
3. Go to **Data storage** \> **Containers**, and create a container.
4. Enter a name for the container, and set the **Public access level** field to **Private (no anonymous access)**.
5. Open the new container, and go to **Settings** \> **Access policy**.
6. Select **Add policy** to add a stored access policy.
7. Set the **Identifier** field as appropriate.
8. In the **Permissions** field, select all permissions.

9. Enter the start and end dates. The end date should be in future.
10. Select **OK** to save the policy, and then save your changes to the container.
11. Go to **Settings** \> **Shared access tokens**, and set the field values.
12. Enter the start and end dates. The end date should be in future.
13. In the **Permissions** field, select the following permissions:

    - Read
    - Add
    - Create
    - Write
    - Delete
    - List

14. Select **Generate SAS token and URL**.
15. Copy and store the value in the **Blob SAS URL** field. This value will be used later in this procedure and will be referred to as the *shared access signature URI*.
16. Open the key vault that you intend to use with Electronic invoicing.
17. Go to **Settings** \> **Secrets**, and select **Generate/Import** to create a secret.
18. On the **Create a secret** page, in the **Upload options** field, select **Manual**.
19. Enter the name of the secret. This name will be used during the setup of the service in Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) and will be referred to as the *key vault secret name*. For more information about how to set up RCS,see [Set up Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS)](e-invoicing-set-up-rcs.md).
20. In the **Value** field, enter the shared access signature URI that you copied earlier.
21. Select **Create**.
