# EU Sales list for France

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the European Union (EU) sales list report for services (Déclaration européenne de services [DES]). The French EU sales list report contains information about the sale of services for reporting in XML format.

The following fields are included on the French EU sales list report:

- **EU sales list header:**

    - Company VAT ID
    - Reporting month
    - Reporting year

- **EU sales list lines:**

    - Customer VAT ID
    - Total amount of services

## Setup

For general setup information, see [EU Sales list reporting](emea-eu-sales-list.md#prerequisites).

### Set up company information

Create a registration type, and assign it to **VAT ID** registration category for France and all the countries or regions that your company does business with. For more information, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. In the grid, select your company.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Registration IDs**.
4. On the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
5. On the **Overview** tab, in the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that you created.
6. Enter your company's value-added tax (VAT) ID.
7. Optional: On the **General** tab, in the **General** section, change the period when the VAT ID is used.
8. Close this page.

> [!NOTE] 
> If the **VAT exempt number export** field in the **Intrastat** section on the **Foreign trade and logistics** FastTab is set (that is, it isn't blank), that value will be used, instead of the VAT ID that you created, in the .xml and .xlsx files for the EU sales list report.

### Import Electronic reporting configurations

In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Index), import the latest version of the following Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the EU sales list:

- EU Sales list model
- EU Sales list by columns report
- EU Sales list by rows report
- EU Sales list (FR)

For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

### Set up foreign trade parameters

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Foreign trade** > **Foreign trade parameters**.
2. On the **EU sales list** tab, set the **Report cash discount** option to **Yes** if a cash discount should be included in the value when a transaction is included in the EU sales list.
3. On the **Electronic reporting** FastTab, in the **File format mapping** field, select **EU Sales list (FR)**.
4. In the **Report format mapping** field, select **EU Sales list by rows report** or **EU Sales list by columns report**.

    - In the **Country/region** field, select **FRA**.
    - In the **Country/region type** field, select **Domestic**.

6. List all the countries or regions that your company does business with. For each country that is part of the EU, in the **Country/region type** field, select **EU** to show trade with those countries on the **EU sales list** page.

### Set up sales tax groups

1. Go to **Tax** > **Indirect taxes** > **Sales tax** > **Item sales tax groups**.
2. Create a sales tax group to use when lines are created for the report.
3. In the **Reporting type** field, select **Service**.
