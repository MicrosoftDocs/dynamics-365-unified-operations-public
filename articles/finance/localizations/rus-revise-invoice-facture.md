# Revision factures and corrective factures

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A corrective facture is issued in addition to an original facture in the following cases:

- The cost of goods changes. For example, a supplier provides a discount to the buyer.
- The quantity of shipped goods must be clarified. For example, the actual quantity of received goods doesn't correspond to the data in the facture, or upon receipt of the goods, it's found that some of the goods are damaged.

A revision facture is a new facture that is issued to replace an original, incorrect facture. It reflects the number and date of the original facture, the number and date of the revision facture. A revision facture is typically issued when one of the following accounting mistakes is made:

- Technical mistakes. For example, the facture has the wrong amount, or the accountant entered the address, the seller, or the buyer's name incorrectly.
- Arithmetic mistakes.


You can create and print corrective and revision factures that are based on credit notes, corrective factures, and tax transactions. Revision factures can also be based on previously created factures.

For corrections and revisions, we recommend that you create factures on the basis of credit notes, corrective factures, and previously created factures. In this way, you change the header fields of the facture You should limit the creation of corrective factures on the basis of tax transactions, because when prices that have an accuracy of two characters are recalculated based on the amount of value-added tax (VAT), a significant rounding difference can arise.

## Set up parameters to create corrective and revision factures

### Set up Accounts receivable parameters for corrective and revision factures

1.	Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.
2.	On the **Ledger and sales tax** tab, on the **General** FastTab, set the **Control item dimension for correction lines** option to **Yes**.

> 
 > - **Facture** – This reference is used for regular customer factures.
 > - **Corrective facture** – This reference is used for factures of the **Correction type**.

## Create a corrective or revision facture
You can create and print corrective and revision factures that are based on credit notes, corrective factures, and tax transactions.

### Create a corrective or revision facture based on credit notes or corrective invoices
Corrective and revision factures can be created on the basis of documents (invoices and credit notes) where the document header indicates the corrected or revised document. In this case, the system establishes an automatic connection with the lines of the corrected or revised document. If a one-to-one correspondence between the lines of the original document and the corrected or revised document can't be determined automatically, the user should manually establish it on the document lines.

### Create a corrective or revision facture based on a tax transaction
Corrective and revision factures can be created based on a tax transaction. In this case, the amount excluding VAT and the amount including VAT are calculated based on the tax transaction amount.

Correction or revision amounts are distributed to the lines of the original facture subject to the previous corrections or revisions. Distribution can be done either automatically or manually:

- Automatic distribution provides a proportional change in price, amount excluding VAT, and amount including VAT for those lines of the corrected or revised facture where the tax code matches the tax code of the tax transaction.
- Manual distribution is done on a user-selected line of the original facture.

#### Example of automatic correction distribution
This example shows the process of automatic correction distribution for an original sales facture that contains three lines.

1.	Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Invoices** \> **All free text invoices**.
2.	Create a free text invoice that has three lines. For the first two lines, set the item sales tax group to **VAT18**. For the third, set it to **VAT10**.
