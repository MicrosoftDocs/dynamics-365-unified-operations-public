# VAT declaration (France)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to set up and generate a report for France that can be used to report a value-added tax (VAT) declaration in the [www.impots.gouv.fr](http://www.impots.gouv.fr) online portal by using the exchange of computerized forms (EFI) channel.

To automatically generate the report, you must first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each box on the VAT declaration. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the Electronic reporting (ER) format for the VAT declaration, you must associate sales tax codes with the result of the lookups for the VAT declaration boxes.

For France, you must configure three lookups:

- Operation lookup
- Report field lookup
- Monaco lookup

For more information about how to set up application-specific parameters, see the [Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields](#set-up-application-specific-parameters-for-vat-declaration-fields) section later in this topic.

In the following tables, the **Lookup result** column shows the lookup result that is preconfigured for a specific VAT declaration row in the VAT declaration format. Use this information to correctly associate sales tax codes with the lookup result and then with the row of the VAT declaration.

### Note about purchase reverse charge VAT

If you configure sales tax codes to post incoming reverse charge VAT by using use tax, associate your sales tax codes with the lookup result of the **Report field** lookup that contains "UseTax" in the name.

Alternatively, you can configure two separate sales tax codes: one for VAT due and one for VAT deduction. Then associate each code with the appropriate lookup report of the **Report field** lookup.

**Example**

For a taxable purchase of electricity, gas, heat, or cold that has a domestic reverse charge, you configure sales tax code **UT\_S\_RC** with use tax. You then associate the code with the **UseTaxTaxableElectricityGasHeatCold** lookup result of the **Operation** lookup and the **UseTaxFranceStandard** lookup result of the **Report field** lookup. In this case, amounts that use the **UT\_S\_RC** sales tax code will be reflected on line 3A (via the **Operation** lookup), and on lines 08 and 20 (using the **Report field** lookup).

Alternatively, you configure two sales tax codes:

- **VAT\_S\_RC**, which has a tax rate value of -20 percent
- **InVAT\_S\_RC**, which has a tax rate value of 20 percent

You then associate the codes with lookup results in the following way:

- Associate **VAT\_S\_RC** with the **TaxableElectricityGasHeatCold** lookup result of the **Operation** lookup and the **VATDueFranceStandard** lookup result of the **Report field** lookup.
- Associate **InVAT\_S\_RC** with the **VATDeductionOtherGoodsServices** lookup result of the **Report field** lookup.

In this case, amounts that use the **VAT\_S\_RC** sales tax code will be reflected on lines 3A (via the **Operation** lookup) and 08 (via the **Report field** lookup). Amounts that use the **InVAT\_S\_RC** sales tax code will be reflected on line 20 (via the **Report field** lookup).

For more information about how to configure reverse charge VAT, see [Reverse charges](emea-reverse-charge.md).

## Set up a VAT declaration preview for France

### Import ER configurations

1. Open the **Electronic reporting** workspace.
2. Import the following version or later of this ER format:

    - VAT Declaration Excel (FR) version 85.15

### <a name="set-up-application-specific-parameters-for-vat-declaration-fields"></a>Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields

To automatically generate a VAT declaration preview report in Microsoft Excel, associate sales tax codes in the application and lookup results in the ER configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you enable the feature, **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled, parameters that are configured for the earlier version of an ER format automatically become applicable for the later version of the same format. If this feature is not enabled, you must configure application-specific parameters explicitly for each format version. The **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature is available in the **Feature management** workspace starting in Finance version 10.0.23. For more information about how to set up the parameters of an ER format for each legal entity, see [Set up the parameters of an ER format per legal entity](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-app-specific-parameters-set-up.md).

#### Set up operations

Follow these steps to define which sales tax codes generate which boxes in section A, "AMOUNT OF OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT."

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT declaration Excel (FR)** configuration, and then select **Configurations** \> **Application specific parameters setup** to open the **Application specific parameters** page.
3. On the **Application specific parameters** page, on the **Lookups** FastTab, select **Operation lookup**.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, set the following fields to associate the sales tax codes and operations.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Lookup result | Select the operation to set up. For more information about the operations and their assignment to VAT declaration rows, see the [VAT declaration preview overview](#vat-declaration-preview-overview) section earlier in this topic. |
    | Tax code | Select the sales tax code to associate with the operation. Posted tax transactions that use the selected sales tax code will be collected in the appropriate declaration box. We recommend that you separate sales tax codes in such a way that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box. |
    | Transaction classifier | <p>If you created enough sales tax codes to determine a declaration box, select **\*Not blank\***. If you didn't create enough sales tax codes so that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box, set up a transaction classifier. The following transaction classifiers are available:</p><ul><li>**Purchase**</li><li>**PurchaseExempt** (tax-exempt purchase)</li><li>**PurchaseReverseCharge** (tax receivable from a purchase reverse charge)</li><li>**Sales**</li><li>**SalesExempt** (tax-exempt sale)</li><li>**SalesReverseCharge** (tax payable from a purchase reverse charge or a sales reverse charge)</li><li>**Use tax**</li></ul><p>For each transaction classifier, a classifier for the credit note is also available. For example, one of these classifiers is **PurchaseCreditNote** (purchase credit note).</p> |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Be sure to associate all sales tax codes with lookup results. If any sales tax codes should not generate values in section A, associate them with the **Other** lookup result.

## Preview the VAT declaration from electronic messages

If you use electronic messages to generate the report, you can collect tax data from multiple legal entities. For more information, see the [Run a VAT
declaration for multiple legal entities](#run-a-vat-declaration-for-multiple-legal-entities) section later in this topic.

### Set up electronic messages

#### Download and import example settings for electronic messages

The data package that includes example settings contains electronic message settings that are used to generate the Excel report for France. You can extend these settings or create your own. For more information about how to work with electronic messaging and create your own settings, see [Electronic messaging](../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.md).

1. In [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2), in the Shared asset library, select **Data package** as the asset type, and then download the **FR VAT declaration** package. The downloaded file is named **FR VAT declaration package.zip**.
2. In Finance, in the **Data management** workspace, select **Import**.
3. On the **Import** FastTab, in the **Group name** field, enter a name for the job.
4. On the **Selected entities** FastTab, select **Add file**.
5. In **Add file** dialog box, make sure that the **Source data format** field is set to **Package**, select **Upload and add**, and then select the zip file that you downloaded earlier. Select **Close**.
6. After the data entities are uploaded, on the Action Pane select **Import**.
7. Go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages**, and review the electronic message processing that you imported (**FR VAT declaration**).

#### Configure electronic messages

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Populate records actions**.
2. Select the **FR Populate VAT return records** line, and then select **Edit query**.
3. Use the filter to specify the settlement periods to include in the report.
4. If you must report tax transactions from other settlement periods in a different declaration, create a new **Populate records** action, and select the appropriate settlement periods.

### Generate a VAT declaration preview from electronic messages

The following procedure applies to the example electronic message processing that you imported earlier from the LCS Shared asset library.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages**.
2. In the left pane, select the report format to generate. For example, select **FR VAT declaration**.
3. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **New**, and then, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **OK**.
4. Select the message line that is created, enter a description, and then specify the start and end dates for the declaration.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Steps 5 through 7 are optional.

5. Optional: On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Collect data**, and then select **OK**. The sales tax payments that were generated earlier are added to the message. For more information, see the [Settle and post sales tax](#settle-and-post-sales-tax) section earlier in this topic. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
6. Optional: On the **Message items** FastTab, review the sales tax payments that are transferred for processing. By default, all sales tax payments of the selected period that weren't included in any other message of the same processing are included.
7. Optional: Select **Original document** to review the sales tax payments, or select **Delete** to exclude sales tax payments from processing. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
8. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Update status**. In the **Update status** dialog box, select the **Ready to generate** action, and then select **OK**. Verify that the message status is changed to **Ready to generate**.
9. Select **Generate report**. To preview the VAT declaration amounts, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **Preview report**, and then select **OK**.
10. In the **Electronic reporting parameters** dialog box, set the following fields, and then select **OK**.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Settlement period | Select the settlement period. If you selected **Collect data** in step 5, you can disregard this field. The report will be generated for the sales tax transactions that are included in the collected sales tax payments. |
    | Tax declaration version | <p>Select one of the following values:</p><ul><li>**Original** – Generate a report for sales tax transactions of the original sales tax payment or before the sales tax payment is generated.</li><li>**Corrections** – Generate a report for sales tax transactions of all the subsequent sales tax payments for the period.</li><li>**Total list** – Generate a report for all sales tax transactions for the period, including the original and all corrections.</li></ul> |
    | <p>Credit carried forward from the previous statement</p><p>Single tax coefficient</p><p>Credit repayment requested VAT credit transferred to the group head company on the summary declaration</p><p>Assimilated taxes</p><p>Total payable paid by the company head of the group on the summary declaration</p> | Set these fields as explained in the [Preview the VAT declaration in Excel](#preview-the-vat-declaration-in-excel-from-the-report-sales-tax-for-settlement-period-periodic-task) section earlier in this topic. |

    If you selected **Collect data** in step 5, you can disregard this field. The report will be generated for the sales tax transactions that are included in the collected sales tax payments.

11. Select the **Attachments** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select **Open** to open the file. Review the amounts in the Excel document.

5. In the **Datasources setup** grid, add a line for each additional legal entity that must be included in reporting, and set the following fields.

    | Field                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
    |------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Name                   | Enter a value that will help you understand where this record comes from. For example, enter **VAT payment of Subsidiary 1**. |
    | Message item type      | Select **VAT return**. This value is the only value that is available for all the records.                                    |
    | Account type           | Select **All**.                                                                                                               |
    | Master table name      | Specify **TaxReportVoucher** for all the records.                                                                             |
    | Document number field  | Specify **Voucher** for all the records.                                                                                      |
    | Document date field    | Specify **TransDate** for all the records.                                                                                    |
    | Document account field | Specify **TaxPeriod** for all the records.                                                                                    |
    | Company                | Select the ID of the legal entity.                                                                                            |
    | User query             | The checkbox is automatically selected when you define criteria by selecting **Edit query**.                                  |

6. For each new line, select **Edit query**, and specify a related settlement period for the legal entity that is specified in the **Company** field on the line.

    When the setup is completed, the **Collect data** function on the **Electronic messages** page collects sales tax payments from all legal entities that you defined.
