### Set up company information

Create a registration type, and assign it to the **VAT ID** registration category for Germany and all the countries or regions that your company does business with. For more information, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. In the grid, select your company.
3. On the **Addresses** FastTab, set the city, ZIP/postal code, and street for the primary address that will be shown on the EU sales list report.
4. On the Action Pane, select **Registration IDs**.
5. On the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
6. On the **Overview** tab, in the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that you created.
7. Enter your company's value-added tax (VAT) ID.
8. Optional: On the **General** tab, in the **General** section, change the period when the VAT ID is used.
9. Close this page.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the **VAT exempt number export** field in the **Intrastat** section on the **Foreign trade and logistics** FastTab is set (that is, it isn't blank), that value will be used, instead of the VAT ID that you created, in the .txt and .xlsx files for the EU sales list report.

2. On the **EU sales list** tab, set the **Report cash discount** option to **Yes** if a cash discount should be included in the value when a transaction is included in the EU sales list.
3. On the **Electronic reporting** FastTab, in the **File format mapping** field, select **EU Sales list (DE)**.
