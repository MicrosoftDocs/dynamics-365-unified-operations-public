In standard Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance functionality, there are sales agreements and purchase agreements. For more information about these agreement types, see:

- [Sales agreements overview](../../supply-chain/sales-marketing/sales-agreements.md)
- [Enter sales agreements](../../supply-chain/sales-marketing/tasks/enter-sales-agreements.md)
- [Fulfill sales agreements](../../supply-chain/sales-marketing/tasks/fulfill-sales-agreements.md)
- [Purchase agreements](../../supply-chain/procurement/purchase-agreements.md)
- [Create a purchase agreement](../../supply-chain/procurement/tasks/create-purchase-agreement.md)
- [Create a purchase release order from a purchase agreement](../../supply-chain/procurement/tasks/create-purchase-release-order-purchase-agreement.md)

In the Russian localization, the following extensions are included in the settings:

- Agreements are numbered within the agreement classification.
- In the **Associated classification** field, you can select a purchase agreement classification that is related to the current sales agreement classification and a sales agreement classification that is related to the current purchase agreement classification.
- You can specify a date and subject for the agreement.
- You can set financial information, such as the agreement amount, credit limit, and posting profile parameters.
- You can specify contact information for the agreement.
- You can set a commission for sales agreements.

When you create an agreement, you can set up payment parameters in the usual way.

In the Russian localization, you can create a calendar of payment days. You can then specify this calendar in the **Payment day** field. You can also complete the following operations, inquiries, and reports, and include an indication of the agreement:

- Register a payment from the customer or a payment to the vendor.
- Register accounts receivable or accounts payable on the **Free text invoice** and **General journals** pages.
- Settle factures on a counterparty in the context of agreements.
- View balances and amounts for the agreement.
- Create an Act of adjustment for the counterparty.
