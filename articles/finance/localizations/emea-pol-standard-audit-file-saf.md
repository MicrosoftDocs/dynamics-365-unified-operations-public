# Standard audit file (SAF) for Poland

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Users in legal entities in Poland can generate a Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) in XML format. This topic provides information about the formats for Poland. 

Users in legal entities in Poland can generate a Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) in XML format. This document provides information about the formats for Poland. This document refers to functionality that has not yet been released.

## Set up the Standard Audit File for Tax for Poland
To specify an Electronic reporting (ER) format for each SAF-T scheme, click **General ledger > Ledger setup > General ledger parameters**, and then, on the **Standard Audit File for Taxes (SAF-T)** tab, set up a specific format for each of the following schemes:

-   SAF Accounting books
-   SAF Bank statements
-   SAF Inventory
-   SAF VAT sale and purchase registers
-   SAF VAT invoices

Each ER format should be predefined and can be updated in ER.

## Generate a SAF Accounting books file
To generate a SAF Accounting books file, click **General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) > SAF Accounting books**, and set the following parameters.

|Parameter                                        |  Description            |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **From date**                                   | Specify the first date to export reporting data for. |
| **To date**                                     | Specify the last date to export reporting data for.  |
| **Authority identification**                    | Specify the identifier of the tax authority to use in the export file.|
| **Posting layer**                               | Select one or more posting layers from which to consider transactions. This parameter affects all parts of the report. |
| **Should opening balance be shown by turnover** | If this parameter is selected, the opening balance is affected by the accumulated turnover. This parameter affects only the ZOiS export file part. |
| **Separate balance**                            | This parameter can be considered for main accounts where the corresponding parameter is marked. This parameter affects only the ZOiS export file part.     |
| **Closing transactions**                        | If this parameter is selected, closing transactions will be included in the data that is exported. This parameter affects only the ZOiS export file part. |

This regulatory report must be provided by request and includes accounting data for the reporting period. It includes accounting data in the selected posting layers for all the main accounts that have non-zero aggregated turnover or transactions during the reporting period.

## Generate a SAF Bank statement file
To generate a SAF Bank statement file, click **General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) > SAF Bank statement**, and set the following parameters.

| Parameter                    | Description                                                                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **From date**                | Specify the first date to export reporting data for.                               |

## Generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register
Before you can generate a SAF value-added tax (VAT) sales and purchase register, you must complete the following additional setup:

-   Set up sales tax authorities.
-   Set up sales tax codes for VAT reporting.
-   Set up sales tax codes.
-   Configure the ER model, and format for the report.

For more information about the setup of VAT statements, see [VAT reporting for Europe](emea-vat-reporting.md).

### Set up sales tax authorities

For general information about how to set up a sales tax authority, see [Set up sales tax authorities](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-authorities.md). To generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register in the required format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the report layout for sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page (**Tax > Indirect taxes > Sales tax > Sales tax authorities**), set the **Report layout** field to **Default**. Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that will be used for the sales tax codes.

### Set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes

A reporting code is an integer value. Reporting codes should be numbered according to the company's rules. However, we recommend that you vary the codes by tax direction. For example, use a five-digit code, and set the codes for all outgoing transactions, which should be reflected in the first part of the VAT scheme, so that they are less than or equal to 19999. Set the codes for all incoming transactions, which should be reflected in the second part of the VAT scheme, so that they are more than or equal to 20000. In this way, you simplify the setup for reports and for data export that is based on tax transactions that are aggregated by reporting codes. Here is an example that shows how you can use sales tax reporting codes to generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register. For this example, reporting codes are in the format *ABBCC*. This format consists of the following parts:

-   **A** - The transaction direction. The value is **1** for outgoing, **2** for incoming, **3** for corrections.
-   **BB** - The tax code. The numbering is sequential among all tax codes.
-   **CC**-   The transaction type number within a tax code. See the following table.

| Transaction type                      | Transaction type number     |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Taxable Sales**                     | 01                          |
| **Tax-free sales**                    | 02                          |
| **Sales tax payable**                 | 03                          |
| **Taxable sales credit note**         | 04                          |
| **Tax exempt sales credit note**      | 05                          |
| **Sales tax on sales credit note**    | 06                          |
| **Taxable purchases**                 | 07                          |
| **Tax-free purchase**                 | 08                          |
| **Sales tax receivable**              | 09                          |
| **Taxable import**                    | 10                          |
| **Offset taxable import**             | 11                          |
| **Use tax**                           | 12                          |
| **Offset use tax**                    | 13                          |
| **Taxable purchase credit note**      | 14                          |
| **Tax exempt purchase credit note**   | 15                          |
| **Sales tax on purchase credit note** | 16                          |
| **Taxable import credit note**        | 17                          |
| **Offset taxable import credit note** | 18                          |

The following table shows the sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes for this example.

For invoices that aren't paid within 150 days, an **Overdue debt VAT** periodic task can be applied. In this case, the same reporting codes that are used for **K_44** and/or **K_46** can be used. The system will automatically interpret transactions for reporting in **K_49** (Overdue invoice) and **K_50** (Paid overdue invoice). 

### Configure the ER model, and format for the report

To review or change the configuration for the SAF VAT sales and purchase register, on the **Reporting configurations** page, in the list of models, select the **Standard Audit File (SAF-T)** model. Then click **Designer** to review or change the model. To review or change the format for the SAF VAT sales and purchase register, on the **Reporting configurations** page, under **Standard Audit File (SAF-T)**, select **VAT Register (PL)**, and then click **Designer**. For more information about ER, see the following topics:

-   [Electronic reporting overview](../../dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md)
-   [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md)
-   [Localization requirements - Create a ER configuration](../../dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-configuration.md)

Initially, the configuration is an example of VAT Register based on Reporting codes described in table above. If you need to adopt the configuration to another set of reporting codes, you should derive the format of the configuration. To do so, select the format in the configuration's tree and click **Create configuration** in **Main menu**. **Mark Derive from name:...,** fill in **Name** and **Description** fields of a new format and click **Create configuration** button. Created format is a copy of the parent format. Select the created format and click **Designer** on the **Main menu** to open format designer and update format with your reporting codes. Format designer window is divided into two parts: the left side â€“ is a format structure (in VAT register case it is a XML scheme); the right side â€“ is a Data Model (data). Press **Mapping** button in the right side to see the **Data model**. The Data Model includes all the field for all the SAF-T reports. VAT register format is mapped mostly to the **TaxTransaction** node. Scroll down the tree to find and select it. All tax transactions are grouped into two groups: for tag **SprzedazWiersz** and for tag **ZakupWiersz**. And called **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList**, respectively. These are record lists calculated (filtered) by formulas. You can review and modify formula in formula redactor. To do so, select calculated field or record list (in this particular case) and click **Edit** in tree menu. Edit formulas for **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList** according to your company's Reporting codes and save them. Formula designer window in the left side shows the Data model where you can select fields or record lists and in the right side all the functions which you may implement. (More information about Format designer - [Formula designer in Electronic reporting](../../dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting-formula-designer.md)). After Tax transactions were divided into two groups, inside each of both groups Tax transactions should be grouped for each tag according to your company's Reporting codes. Find calculated fields "list\_K" under **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList** and update their formulas with your Reporting codes using Formula Designer. After all "list\_K"? nodes formulas were updated find and modify **SalasCtrl** and **PurchCtrl** under **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList**, respectively. These nodes are used for **SprzedazCtrl** and **ZakupCtrl** tags, respectively. Basically, no other modifications in the format are needed. Save the format. Close it and complete the format using **Change status** &gt; **Complete** button on the versions menu on **Versions** FastTab on **Configurations**.

### Generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register

To generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register, click **General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) > SAF VAT sales and purchase register**, and set the following parameters.

|   Parameter                  |   Description                                                                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **From date**                | Specify the first date to export reporting data for.                               |
| **To date**                  | Specify that last date to export reporting data for.                               |
| **Authority identification** | In the list, select the identifier of the tax authority to use in the export file. |

You can specify additional selection parameters by using the **Filter** functionality on the **Records to include** tab.

## Generate a SAF VAT invoices file

Before you can generate a SAF VAT invoices file, you must complete the following additional setup.

-   Set up sales tax authorities.
-   Sales tax codes for VAT reporting.
-   Set up sales tax codes.
-   Configure the ER model, and format for the report.

This setup resembles the additional setup that you completed for the SAF VAT sales and purchase register excepting **Configure the ER model, and format for the report.**

To correctly report some of the important tags in the report, define the application-specific parameters (for versions of the **VAT Invoices (PL)** format starting from 48.36.58). 

1. Open **Configurations** \> **Application specific parameters**, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Setup**.
2. Select the version of the format that you're going to use (for example, **48.36.58**), and then set up the values for each lookup in the list on the right.

    | Name            | Short description (English) | Short description (Polish) | Description (English) | Description (Polish) |

- **oo** – Reverse charge as part of domestic transactions
- **np** – For transactions of delivery of goods and provision of services outside the country

You must set up and use specific exempt codes (**Tax \> Setup \> Sales tax \> Sales tax exempt codes**) for sales tax codes that are set up as exempt in sales tax groups (**Tax \> Indirect tax \> Sales tax \> Sales tax groups**) to distinguish tax transactions by these exempt codes in the report. For the purposes of the report, you have to define which exempt codes must be reported with the given values of the **P_12** tag. Select the **VAT Invoices (PL)** format, open **Configurations** \> **Application specific parameters**, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Setup**. For the latest version of the configuration, on the **Lookups** FastTab, select **TaxFree_LOOKUP**. Then, on the **Conditions** FastTab, define conditions for the following lookup results.

| Lookup result               | Exempt codes |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| **np**                      | Select the exempt codes that are used for sales tax transactions of delivery of goods and provision of services outside the country. If there is more than one exempt code of this type, you must add a line for each additional exempt code that is used for transactions of delivery of goods and provision of services outside the country. |
| **zw**                      | Select **Not blank**. All other transactions that are exempt, but where the reason isn't considered, will be reported as reverse charges as part of domestic transactions. This line must be the last line in the list. You can verify that it's the last line, by looking at the value in the **Line** column. |

> [!NOTE]
> Tax transactions that are marked as **Reverse charge** will be reported as **oo**. No additional setup is required.

When you've completed the setup for the **TaxFree_LOOKUP** lookup field and are ready to set up the next lookup field, select **Save**.

### TaxExemptReason_LOOKUP

Conditions for **TaxExemptReason_LOOKUP** are sales tax exempt codes that are defined in Finance (**Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax exempt codes**) and used in sales tax groups when tax transactions are posted. If no lines on an invoice have sales tax exemptions, the **P_19** field will be reported with a value of **False**, and the **P_19A**, **P_19B**, and **P_19C** tags will be omitted.

- **P_19A** indicates the provision of the act was issued on the basis of which the taxpayer applies tax exemption.
- **P_19B** indicates the provision of Directive 2006/112/EC, which exempts the supply of goods or such services from such tax.
- **P_19C** indicates another legal basis that indicates that the supply of goods or services benefits from the exemption.

When you've completed the setup for the **TaxExemptReason_LOOKUP** lookup field and are ready to set up the next lookup field, select **Save**.

### Implementation details

In version 3 of the **JPK_FA** report, invoices that have different document currencies can be reported in the same file. For this purpose, the **Currency** parameter in the dialog box for the **SAF VAT invoices (Poland)** report is optional. If you specify a currency, the report will include only invoices that have that currency. If you don't specify a currency, the report will be generated for all invoices.

#### <P_14x> tags

According to the requirements of version 3 of the **JPK_FA** report, when an invoice is posted in a currency that differs from **PLN**, the **<P_13x>**, **<P_14x>**, and **<P_15>** tags must represent the amounts in the invoice currency, and the new **<P_14xW>** tags must represent related amounts in the **PLN** currency. It's assumed that **PLN** is defined as the currency for the sales tax codes that are used for transactions that will be included on the **JPK_FA** report. Based on this assumption, for invoices where the document currency differs from the currency that is set up in the sales tax codes that are used in the tax transactions of that document, the system reports additional **<P_14xW>** tags with the amount in the sales tax code currency (because the currency is assumed to be **PLN**).

#### <P_18A> tag

KB #4339927 ("A country specific update for Poland for Split payments in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations apps") introduces the setup of methods of payments as split payments in the **Accounts receivable** module.

According to the requirements of version 3 of the **JPK_FA** report, the **<P_18A>** tag for an invoice must be reported as **True** when the split payment mechanism is applied for that invoice. To determine whether the split payment mechanism was applied to the invoice, the system checks the **Split payment** parameter of the method of payment that was used during invoice posting and that is reflected in the corresponding customer transaction in the CustTrans table. It's important that you keep the setup of the **Split payment** parameter for the methods of payment stable to ensure correct reporting.

#### <P_22> tag

The **<P_22>** tag will be reported with a value of **True** according to the setup of the sales tax codes in **ItemType_LOOKUP** where **Result** = **Transport** in the application-specific parameters of the **VAT Invoices (PL)** format.

#### <P_106E_3> and <P_106E_3A> tags

According to the requirements of the **JPK_FA** report, the **<P_106E_3>** tag must report **True** in the case of the delivery of second-hand goods, works of art, collector's items, and antiques, for which the taxable base is in accordance with article 120, paragraph four, margin five. When the **<P_106E_3>** tag is reported with a value of **True**, the **<P_106E_3A>** tag must represent related values.

| Value of the <P_106E_3A> tag | Description (Polish) | Description (English) | How Finance distinguishes the tag |
|--------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| **procedura marży - towary używane** | Dostawy towarów używanych dla których podstawę opodatkowania stanowi zgodnie z art. 120 ust. 4 i 5 marża | Deliveries of second-hand goods for which the tax base is constituted in accordance with article 120, paragraph four, margin five | According to the setup of sales tax codes in **ItemType_LOOKUP** where **Result** = **SecondHandGoods** in the application-specific parameters of the **VAT Invoices (PL)** format | 
| **procedura marży - dzieła sztuki** | Dostawy dzieł sztuki, przedmiotów kolekcjonerskich i antyków, dla których podstawę opodatkowania stanowi zgodnie z art. 120 ust. 4 i 5 marża | Deliveries of works of art for which the tax base is constituted in accordance with article 120, paragraph four, margin five | According to the setup of sales tax codes in **ItemType_LOOKUP** where **Result** = **ArtWorks** in the application-specific parameters of the **VAT Invoices (PL)** format |
| **procedura marży - przedmioty kolekcjonerskie i antyki** | Dostawy przedmiotów kolekcjonerskich i antyków, dla których podstawę opodatkowania stanowi zgodnie z art. 120 ust. 4 i 5 marża | Deliveries of collector's items and antiques for which the tax base is constituted in accordance with article 120, paragraph four, margin five | According to the setup of sales tax codes in **ItemType_LOOKUP** where **Result** = **CollectorAntiques** in the application-specific parameters of the **VAT Invoices (PL)** format |

#### Zamowienie and ZamowienieCtrl nodes

According to the requirements of version 3 of the **JPK_FA** report, the **Zamowienie** node must represent the orders or contracts that are referred to in article 106f, paragraph 1, item 4 of the Act (for advance invoices) in the currency in which the advance invoice was issued (Zamówienia lub umowy, o których mowa w art. 106f ust. 1 pkt 4 ustawy (dla faktur zaliczkowych) w walucie, w której wystawiono fakturę zaliczkową).

To complete this requirement, the system collects information from the database for the lines of sales orders and free text invoices that are linked to the advance invoices that are included on the report and provides the following information from them.

| Tag name | Description (Polish) | Description (English) | How Finance collects information |
|--------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| **P_7Z** | Nazwa (rodzaj) towaru lub usługi | Name (type) of the good or service | The value that is stored on the line of the sales order or free text invoice in the Finance database |
| **P_8AZ** | Miara zamówionego towaru lub zakres usługi | Unit of measure of the ordered goods or scope of service | The value of the unit of measure that is stored on the line of the sales order or free text invoice in the Finance database (If the field is empty, "usługa" is used.) |
| **P_8BZ** | Ilość zamówionego towaru lub zakres usługi | Quantity of ordered goods or scope of service | The value of the quantity that is stored on the line of the sales order or free text invoice in the Finance database |
| **P_9AZ** | Cena jednostkowa netto | Net unit price | The value of the price that is stored on the line of the sales order or free text invoice in the Finance database |
| **P_11NettoZ** | Wartość zamówionego towaru lub usługi bez kwoty podatku | Value of the ordered goods or services without the amount of tax | The value of the tax base amount that is calculated for the line of the sales order or free text invoice, based on the quantity that is stored on the line (**P_8BZ**). |
| **P_11VatZ** | Kwota podatku od zamówionego towaru lub usługi | Tax amount on ordered goods or services | The value of the tax amount that is calculated for the line of the sales order or free text invoice, based on the quantity that is stored on the line (**P_8BZ**). |
| **P_12Z** | Stawka podatku | Tax rate | The calculated value of the tax rate, based on the tax setup on the line of the sales order or free text invoice (sales tax group and item sales tax group). |

With respect to the values that are reported for the lines of sales orders or free text invoices, the value of the **WartoscZamowienia** tag of the **Zamowienie** node is calculated as the sum of calculated values for the tax base amount and the tax amount (**P_11NettoZ** + **P_11VatZ**) for all document lines.

The value of the **WartoscZamowien** tag of the **ZamowienieCtrl** node is calculated as the sum of **WartoscZamowienia** tag value for all the documents that are reported in the **Zamowienie** node.

## Using batch jobs for SAFT

Generating SAF-T reports for a long period such as month or a quarter can include a huge data and take a long time. For such cases, it is recommended to use batch jobs. Dialog page for every SAF-T report has a **Run in the background** tab. Open this tab to set up report's generation in batch mode. Select **Batch processing** check box. To learn more about batch processing see the [Batch processing overview](../../dev-itpro/sysadmin/batch-processing-overview.md) topic. To review batch jobs or find generated file open **Organization administration** &gt; **Electronic reporting** &gt; **Electronic reporting jobs** and find a line related to your job. Click **Show log** button on the **Main menu**. If nothing is shown it means that no messages were produced during the file generation. To see the file click **Show files** button on **Main menu**, find a file that you need and click **Open** on the **Main menu** to review or save the file.
