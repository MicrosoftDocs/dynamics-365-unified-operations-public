# Profit tax declaration

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can generate profit tax declarations in an electronic format. To generate the declaration, you must first set up the rules for collecting data from ledger accounts or profit tax registers in the appropriate financial report for the profit tax declaration.

A data package is available that contains predefined cells names for the profit tax declaration. An Electronic reporting (ER) configuration is available that considers the predefined cells names. The following sections of the profit tax declaration are available in the data package and configured in the ER configuration.

| Section                       | Element in XML   |
|-------------------------------|------------------|
| Section 1                     | НалПУ            |
| Subsection 1.1                | НалПУАв          |
| Subsection 1.2                | НалПУМес         |
| Sheet 02                      | РасчНал          |
| Appendix 1 to Sheet 02        | ДохРеалВнеРеал   |
| Appendix 2 to Sheet 02        | РасхРеалВнеРеал  |

    - Financial reports model
    - Financial reports model mapping (RU)
    - Profit tax declaration format 5.08 (RU)
