[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the change tracking functionality for fixed asset location fields for legal entities with a primary address in Latvia in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

For legal entities with a primary address in Latvia, when you modify the following fields on the **Fixed asset** page, a record of the modification is saved for later viewing.

- **Responsible**
- **Department**
- **Location**

Your modification is saved when you select **Save** or when you move your focus away from the field where you made the change. 

To view the modification history for fields you updated, follow these steps:

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.
1. Select a fixed asset.
1. On the **Fixed asset** tab, select **Transfers** \> **Internal transfer history**.
1. Optionally, select **Print** \> **Internal transfer statement**.
