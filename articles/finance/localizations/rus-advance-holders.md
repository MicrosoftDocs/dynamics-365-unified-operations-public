## Worker table numbers for advance holders

A worker can be an employee or a contractor, and can hold several positions in an organization. An employee or a contractor can also be an advance holder who is accountable for the expense amount that the organization provides. To specify a worker as an advance holder, you must enter a unique worker ID in the **Worker ID** field on the **Worker** page. You must also set the **Advance holder** option to **Yes** on the **Advance holders** page, to indicate that the selected worker is an advance holder.

Transactions for these workers can be posted by using advance holder accounts. The worker ID that is specified for each advance holder can be used to track all advance holder transactions. This number is retrieved as an account number for advance holder transactions on the **General journals** and **Advance holder transactions** pages.
