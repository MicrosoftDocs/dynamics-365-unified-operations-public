# VAT declaration with registers (JPK_V7M, VDEK)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up a value-added tax (VAT) declaration with registers (also known as a JPK_V7M, VDEK) in Poland.

As of October 1, 2020, businesses in Poland are responsible for reporting VAT in an electronic document that consists of a Jednolity Plik Kontrolny VAT (JPK_VAT) together with the declaration (Jednolity Plik Kontrolny VDEK). The requested electronic document includes the following information:

- Both VAT records (a set of information about purchases and sales that is produced from the entrepreneur's VAT records for a given period)
- A VAT declaration (VAT-7 declaration)

## Prerequisites

Before you can prepare Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance to report a JPK_V7M, your business processes and the system must meet the following conditions:

- On the **Sales tax authorities** page (**Tax** > **Indirect tax** > **Sales tax** > **Sales tax authorities**), for the tax authority that is associated with tax codes that are used in tax transactions that must be considered by the JPK_V7M report, the **Report layout** field must be set to **Default**. For more information about how to set up sales tax authorities, see [Set up sales tax authorities](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-authorities.md).
- When tax transactions that must be considered by the JPK_V7M report are posted, the **Date of VAT register** field must be set.
- On the **Sales tax codes** page (**Tax** > **Indirect tax** > **Sales tax** > **Sales tax codes**), for the sales tax codes that are used in tax transactions that must be considered by the JPK_V7M report, the **Type of tax** field must be set to **Standard VAT** or **Reduced VAT**.
- On the **Sales tax codes** page, for the sales tax codes that are used in tax transactions that must be considered by the JPK_V7M report, the sales tax reporting codes that are used in the Electronic reporting (ER) format of the report must be appropriately defined.

## Prepare for JPK_V7M reporting

The solution to support JPK_V7M reporting is based on the [Electronic messaging](../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.md) functionality. This functionality provides a flexible approach for setting up and supporting reporting processes.

The following tasks will prepare Dynamics 365 Finance to report a JPK_V7M:

- Import and set up ER configurations.
- Set up application-specific parameters.
- Import a package of data entities that includes a predefined electronic message setup.
- Set up General ledger parameters.
- Save the executable class parameters for Electronic messaging.
- Set up security roles for electronic message processing.
- Set up an office code for electronic message processing.

### Import and set up ER configurations

To prepare Finance for JPK_V7M reporting, you must import the following versions, or later versions, of ER configurations.

| **ER configuration name**         | **Type**           | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard Audit File (SAF-T)       | Model              | The common ER model for Standard Audit Files.                                                                   |
| Standard Audit File model mapping | Model mapping      | The model mapping that defines data sources for Polish Standard Audit File (JPK) reports.                       |
| JPK-V7M XML format (PL)           | Format (exporting) | The XML format that provides the file that the Polish Ministry of Finance requires to be periodically reported. |
| JPK-V7M Excel format (PL)         | Format (exporting) | The Excel format for preview information that will be reported in XML format.                                   |

Import the latest versions of these configurations. The version description usually includes the number of the Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) article that explains the changes that were introduced in the configuration version. Use the Issue search tool in [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2) to find the KB article by number.

> [!NOTE]
> After all the ER configurations from the preceding table are imported, set the **Default for model mapping** option to **Yes** for the **Standard Audit File model mapping** configuration on the **Configurations** page.

For more information about how to download ER configurations from the Microsoft global repository, see [Download ER configurations from the Global repository](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).

### Set up application-specific parameters

Depending on the tax transaction data, the values of some elements in the JPK_V7M report can be defined for reporting purposes. There must be enough transactional data to define values for these elements. Therefore, set up enough sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups to differentiate tax transactions for all the parameters (elements) that are introduced in the JPK_V7M report. The JPK_V7M format includes application-specific parameters that can be used to define values for these elements in the report.

The format includes the following lookup fields for setup.

| **Name**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Impact**                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ProceduralMarkingsSelector | Procedural markings | Oznaczenia dotyczące procedur | Designations that are related to the procedures | Oznaczenia dotyczące procedur |

For this lookup field, the following master data sources are available for the setup of conditions:

- Sales tax codes
- Sales tax group
- Customer account ID
- Customer group

This lookup field defines conditions that are based on current company's master data sources. These conditions will produce a mark of **1** for the corresponding element from the list of designations that are related to the procedures under the **\<SprzedazWiersz\>** tag. Several designations can be marked for the same output VAT record. Therefore, if a company must report different designations, separate conditions must be defined.

The following table shows the lookup results (designations) for **ProceduralMarkingsSelector**.

For this lookup field, the following master data sources are available for setup:

- Sales tax code
- Item sales tax group
- Customer account ID
- Customer group

This lookup field defines conditions that are based on current company's master data sources. These conditions will produce a mark of **1** for the corresponding element from the list of designations that are related to the supply of goods and services under the **\<SprzedazWiersz\>** tag. Several designations can be marked for the same output VAT record. Therefore, if a company must report different designations, separate conditions must be available in the company's master data.

The following table shows the lookup results (designations) for **ServiceDeliverySelector**.

### Import a package of data entities that includes a predefined electronic message setup

The process of setting up the Electronic messaging functionality for JPK_V7M reporting has many steps. Because the names of some predefined entities are used in the ER configurations, it's important that you use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables.

1. In [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2), in the **Shared asset library**, select the **Data package** asset type. Then find **PL JPK_V7M EM setup**.**zip** in the list of data package files, and download it to your computer.
2. After the PL JPK_V7M EM setup.zip file has been downloaded, open Finance, select the company that you will generate the JPK_VDEK from, and then go to **Workspaces** \> **Data management**.
3. Before you import setup data from the package of data entities, follow these steps to make sure that the data entities in your application are refreshed and synced.
4. In the **Data management** workspace, go to **Framework parameters** \> **Entity settings**, and then select **Refresh entity list**. Wait for confirmation that the refresh has been completed. For more information about how to refresh the entity list, see [Entity list refresh](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities.md#entity-list-refresh).
5. Validate that the source data and target data are correctly mapped. For more information, see the section about validation in [Data import and export jobs](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md#validate-that-the-source-data-and-target-data-are-mapped-correctly).
6. Before the data entities are used for the first time to import the data from the package, sync the mapping of source data and target data. In the list for the package, select a data entity, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Modify target mapping**. Then, above the grid for the package, select **Generate mapping** to create a mapping from scratch.
7. Save the mapping.
8. Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each data entity in the package.

For more information about Data management, see [Data management](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md).

You must now import data from the PL JPK_V7M EM setup.zip file into the selected company.

1. In the **Data management** workspace, select **Import**, set the **Source data format** field to **Package**and create new importing project by New button on the Action pane.
2. Click Add file on the Select entities FastTab.
3. Select **Upload and add**, select the **PL JPK_V7M EM setup**.**zip** file on your computer, and upload it.
4. Click Close button when entities from the package are listed in the grid.
5. Click Import on the Action pane to start importing data from the data entities.

    ![PL JPK_V7M EM setup page](media/import-data-entities.jpg)

You will receive a notification in **Messages**, or you can manually refresh the page to view the progress of the data import. When the import process is completed, the **Execution summary** page shows the results.

![Execution summary page](media/data-entities-imported.jpg)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some records in the data entities in the package include a link to ER configurations. Therefore, be sure to import ER configurations into Finance before you start to import the data entities package.

### Set up General ledger parameters

To work with the Electronic messaging functionality, you must define related number sequences.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
2. On the **Number sequences** tab, set up two number sequences:

    - Message
    - Message item

### Save the executable class parameters for Electronic messaging

The JPK_V7M processing uses the **EMGenerateJPKVDEKReportController_PL** executable class to initiate data collection for the report data provider and further report generation. Before you use this class for the first time, you must save its parameters.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messaging** \> **Executable class settings**.
2. Select the **Wygenerowanie JPK_V7M** executable class (which is set to call **EMGenerateJPKVDEKReportController_PL**), and then, on the Action Pane, select **Parameters**. In the **Generate Polish JPK_VDEK report** dialog box, select **OK**.

In the dialog box for the executable class, the **Retail-specific sales marking** group of parameters is used for retail-specific scenarios. For more information about how to report **RO** and **FP** document types for retail operations, see the "Report RO and FP document types for retail operations" section later in this topic.

### Set up security roles for electronic message processing

Different groups of users might require access to the JPK_V7M processing. You can limit access to the processing, based on security groups that are defined in the system.

Follow these steps to limit access to the JPK_V7M processing.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic message processing**.
2. Select the **JPK_V7M** processing, and add the security groups that must work with it on the **Security roles** FastTab. If no security group is defined for the processing, only a system admin can see it on the **Electronic messages** page.

### Set up an office code for electronic message processing

Follow these steps to enter an office code in the **KodUrzedu** additional field.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic message processing**.
2. Select the **JPK-V7M** processing..
3. On the **Additional field** FastTab, select the **KodUrzedu** additional field, and then, in the **Default value** field, specify the office code that should be reported in the \<**KodUrzedu**\> element of the report.

## JPK-V7M reporting

The JPK-V7M reporting process is predefined by the data entities that are delivered in the PL JPK_V7M EM setup.zip package. The following illustration shows an overview of the process.

![JPK_V7M reporting process flow](media/vdek-em-processing.jpg)

The PL JPK_V7M EM setup.zip package provides a setup for the JPK-V7M processing that supports the process of JPK-V7M reporting. This setup consists of the following steps:

- **Tworzyć (Create)** – Create an electronic message for JPK-V7M reporting.
- **Wygeneruj plik (Generate file)** – Generate an XML file in JPK-V7M format.
- **Podgląd w programie Excel (Preview in Excel format)** – Generate the JPK-V7M report in Excel format for preview.
- **Zmień status (Change status)** – Change the status of the electronic message.

### Initial assumptions for the JPK-V7M report

The implementation of the JPK-V7M report is based on the same sales tax reporting codes that were used in the JPK_VAT report. For more information, see [SAF VAT sales and purchase register](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf.md#generate-a-saf-vat-sales-and-purchase-register).

The following table shows the sales tax reporting codes that are used in the JPK_VAT report and their mapping with **K_\*** elements of the JPK-V7M report.

## Split payment (MPP) marker

The JPK-V7M report introduces the **MPP** marker for both sales registers and purchase registers.

If a company does operations that a split payment procedure must be applied to, the **"Split payment"** feature must be used.

When the Split payment feature is used, you don't have to complete any specific setup to report the **MPP** marker in a JPK-V7M. The following algorithm is used for identification of the **MPP** marker:

- The system provides a check of the **Split payment** and **Voluntary split payment** parameters of the customer transaction that is related to a sales invoice. If the **Split payment** parameter is selected, and the **Voluntary split payment** parameter is cleared, the related invoice will be reported with the **MPP** marker.
- The system provides a check of the **Split payment** and **Voluntary split payment** parameters of the vendor transaction that is related to a vendor invoice. If the **Split payment** parameter is selected, and the **Voluntary split payment** parameter is cleared, the related invoice will be reported with the **MPP** marker.

## Reporting of overdue customer invoices

Version 72.150 of the **JPK-V7M XML format (PL)** configuration, and later versions, support reporting of overdue customer invoices when the local Polish
[Overdue debt VAT](emea-pol-sales-tax-reports.md#allowance-for-bad-debts) feature is used.

### Business requirement

- If the procedure is applied by the company, the **\<P_68\>** element of the declaration part must report the amount of the taxable base for overdue invoices in the reporting period (that is, transactions that are posted to deduct VAT for issued invoices that aren't paid with 150 days after the payment due date).
- If the procedure is applied by the company, the **\<P_69\>** element of the declaration part must report the amount of VAT for overdue invoices in the reporting period (that is, transactions that are posted to deduct VAT for issued invoices that aren't paid within 150 days after the payment due date).
- If the procedure is applied by the company, for overdue invoices in the period where the due date is 150 days, this transaction must be reported. Information about the customer from the original invoice and an amount that has a minus sign (–) must be included.
- If the procedure is applied by the company, for paid overdue invoices in the period when an overdue invoice was paid, this transaction must be reported. All the information about the customer from the original invoice and an amount that has a plus sign (+) must be included.
- If overdue and paid overdue transactions are in the same reporting period, and if the procedure is applied by the company, you can optionally report both transactions together in the sales register. In this case, the**\<P_68\>** and **\<P_69\>** elements of the declaration part aren't reported.

### Supported business user scenario in Finance

When there is an overdue customer invoice, the invoice that is issued to a customer can go through three stages:

1. The invoice is issued to the customer, tax transactions are posted, and the invoice is included in **JPK** \> **Ewidencja** \> **SprzedazWiersz** as usual according to the tax setup and marker setup.
2. If the invoice isn't paid within 150 days after the payment due date, the company can apply the [Overdue debt VAT](emea-pol-sales-tax-reports.md#allowance-for-bad-debts) periodic task by going to **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Overdue debt VAT**. Tax transactions that are produced by this task are reflected in the JPK-V7M report. The following information is included:

    - All the customer information from the original invoice that was posted in stage 1 is included.
    - Amounts are reported in the same **K_\*** elements as in the original invoice, but they have a negative sign.
    - The same markers that were applied in the original invoice are applied.
    - The **\<KorektaPodstawyOpodt\>** marker is applied.

     Moreover, the base amount and tax amount from this invoice (internal document) are included and reported in the **P_68** and **P_69** elements of the declaration part of the report.

3. If the invoice is paid after both stage 1 and stage 2 have occurred, the company must again apply the **Overdue debt VAT** periodic task in the period when the invoice was paid. The resulting tax transactions are reflected in the JPK-V7M report. The following information is included:

    - All customer information from the original invoice that was posted in stage 1 is included.
    - Amounts are reported in the same **K_\*** elements as in the original invoice, but they have a positive sign.
    - The same markers that were applied in the original invoice are applied
    - The **\<KorektaPodstawyOpodt\>** marker is applied.

    The base amount and tax amount from this invoice (internal document) are **not** included and reported in the **P_68** and **P_69** elements of the declaration part of the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If stages 2 and 3 occur in the same reporting period, the **P_68** and **P_69** elements of the declaration part of the report aren't affected.

## Report RO and FP document types for retail operations

Version 83.169 of the **JPK-V7M XML format (PL)** configuration, and later versions, support reporting of the **RO** and **FP** document types for retail operations when the [Supplementary invoices for retail sales for Poland](emea-pol-vdek.md) feature is used.

### Business requirements

The following rules about reporting sales invoices for retail operations are based on the clarifications that are published in the Q&A section of the official tax portal of the Ministry of Finance of Poland:

- All fiscal receipts that are printed and given to the customers must be aggregated and reported as documents of the **RO** type (summarized invoice). Sales to non-domestic customers must be excluded from aggregation and reported as normal invoices (without a document type marker). Aggregation should be done for the reporting period. Sales documents that are reported as documents of the **RO** type (summarized invoice) aren't subject to **GTU** markers. Domestic sales that are aggregated for reporting as taxable documents of the **RO** type must also be reported as separate taxable documents of the **FP** type if the customer requested an invoice for those sales. Invoices that are marked as documents of the **FP** type must be excluded from totals in both **SprzedazCtrl** and all related **P_\*** values of the declaration part. Sales documents that are reported as documents of the **FP** type are subject to **GTU** markers.

### Initial assumptions for the reporting of fiscal documents in a JPK-V7M

- All the documents that come from the point of sale (POS) are fiscalized.
- Information about fiscal receipts that are processed at the POS is correctly reflected in the following system database tables:

    - RetailTransactionTable
    - RetailTransactionSalesTrans

- If a customer provided a VAT number for the fiscal receipt at the POS, it's stored in the RetailTransactionFiscalCustomer.SerializedData table.
- All the fiscal receipts and pre-aggregated fiscal documents that were posted via a retail statement, and that must be aggregated for reporting purposes, are posted in the Customer invoice journal with a status of **Fiscal document** or **Fiscal document converted to invoice**.
- If an invoice was created at the POS, it's correctly reflected in the RetailTransactionSupplementaryInvoice table.
- If a fiscal receipt that was converted from a fiscal document to an invoice, it has an invoice status of **Fiscal document converted to invoice** in the Customer invoice journal. (This assumption applies only to fiscal documents that aren't pre-aggregated.)
- Only posted retail transactions of the **Sales** type are considered retail invoices for the purpose of reporting as documents of the **FP** type.
- Specific scenarios, such as the "Gift card" scenario, are currently out of scope.

### Supported business user scenario in Finance

To report the **RO** and **FP** document types for retail operations, use the following parameters in the **Retail-specific sales marking** group of parameters of the **Wygenerowanie JPK_V7M** (**EMGenerateJPKVDEKReportController_PL**) executable class (**Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messaging** \> **Executable class settings**):

- The **Aggregate fiscal documents** check box activates **Criteria to collect customer invoices for aggregation (RO – summarized invoices)** records that are included to collect and aggregate fiscal receipts that must be reported as documents of the **RO** type.
- The **Report retail POS invoices** check box collects retail invoices that have an invoice date in the reporting period and reports them as documents of the **FP** type.
- The **Report fiscal document converted to invoice** check box collects invoices from the CustInvoiceJour table that have a status of **Fiscal document converted to invoice** and **FiscalDocDate_PL** in the reporting period, and reports them as documents of the **FP** type.

#### Aggregate fiscal documents parameter

By default, the **Aggregate fiscal documents** check box is cleared. In this case, the system doesn't aggregate any documents. The documents are reported as standard documents where no document type is applied. Therefore, the report works as it worked before this change.

When the **Aggregate fiscal documents** check box is selected, domestic invoices that have a status of **Fiscal document** or **Fiscal document converted to invoice**, and that have a **Date of VAT register** value that falls in the reporting period, are reported as one aggregated document of the **RO** type for the reporting period. You define company-specific criteria of domestic fiscal documents that must be aggregated by using **Criteria to collect customer invoices for aggregation ("RO" - summarized invoices)** records.

When the aggregated **RO** document is included in the report, it has following header fields.

| **Reporting tag**  | **Value**                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|

#### Report retail POS invoices parameter

By default, the **Report retail POS invoices** check box is cleared. When it's selected, the system collects retail invoices that meet the following criteria:

- There must be a retail invoice in the RetailTransactionSupplementaryInvoice table for the retail transaction in the RetailTransactionTable table.
- **RetailTransactionTable.Type** must equal **RetailTransactionType::Sales**.
- **RetailTransactionTable.entryStatus** must equal **RetailEntryStatus::Posted**, and the **RetailTransactionTable.StatementId** field must not be blank.
- The invoice date (**RetailTransactionSupplementaryInvoice.InvoiceDate**) is in the reporting period.

The fields of retail POS invoices must be filled in shown in the following table.

| **Reporting tag**  | **Value**                                                                                                           |

The fields of the SAFTTaxTransByReportingCode_PL table are filled in from the following data sources.

| **Table name**                        | **Field names**                                                                                    |

#### Report fiscal document converted to invoice parameter

By default, the **Report fiscal document converted to invoice** check box is cleared. In this case, if the set of tax transactions and related customer invoices were aggregated and reported as documents of the **RO** type, they are excluded from the set of transactions that are reported in the standard.

When the **Report fiscal document converted to invoice** check box is selected, the system collects invoices from the CustInvoiceJour table by using the same **Criteria to collect customer invoices for aggregation** records that are defined for domestic invoices for aggregation. However, the following additional criteria are also used:

- **CustInvoiceJour_PL.FiscalDocState_PL** must equal **Fiscal document converted to invoice**.
- **CustInvoiceJour_PL.FiscalDocDate_PL** must be in the reporting period.

During preprocessing, these invoices are treated as standard invoices. The only difference is that their document type is set to **FP**.

## Generate the JPK-V7M report for part of a month

Version 72.158 of the **JPK-V7M XML format (PL)** configuration, and later versions, support JPK-V7M reporting for periods that are shorter than a full month.

To generate the JPK-V7M report for a period that is shorter than a full month, on the **Electronic messages** page (**Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages**), use the **From date** and **To date** fields to define the date interval that you want to generate JPK-V7M report for. These dates must be in the same calendar month.

When you generate the JPK-V7M report in XML format for a period that is shorter than a full month, you receive a warning that the report is being generated for less than a full month, and that it can't be used for submission to the authority. The report will also contain the following information that indicates that it isn't for a full month:

- The **\<Miesiac\>** tag will contain information about the date interval that report is generated for.
- The **\<P_\*\>** tag of the **Deklaracja** part of the report contains calculated values that represent the aggregation of amounts from the **SprzedazWiersz** and **ZakupWiersz** parts of the report. The values in this tag will be rounded to 'a two-digit decimal value, but not an integer value.
