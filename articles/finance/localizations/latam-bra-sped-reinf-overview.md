# SPED-Reinf (Brazil) 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The SPED-Reinf is a tax statement report that gathers information about withholding tax and other tax information from the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (RFB) and Social Security. In Brazilian Portuguese, the abbreviation *Reinf* stands for "retenções e outras informações fiscais," or "withholdings and other tax information." The SPED-Reinf was created to assess federal taxes that are withheld for the purpose of Social Security and income taxes, and for activities that aren't related to labor. Examples of these activities include fiscal documents and payments.  

The statement consists of a set of events. These events must be delivered in specific layouts through the public digital bookkeeping system (SPED), and a valid digital certificate must be used to deliver them. This certificate must be issued by an entity that has been accredited by the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (ICP-Brasil).

The statement is considered valid after receipt is confirmed and the contents of the files are validated.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance supports the generation of SPED-Reinf events through the **Fiscal books** module and the Immediate Provision of Information (SII) reporting register framework. You can exchange XML messages for every event that the tax authority requires.
