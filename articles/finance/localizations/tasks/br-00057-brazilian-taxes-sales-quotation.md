# Brazilian tax in sales quotations

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Use this procedure to create a sales quotation that uses Brazilian taxes. You can create a quotation by specifying fiscal information, such as the operation type and the Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) code. When you create a quotation line, you can select a CFOP code in the CFOP field. The CFOP codes that are available in this field depend on the fiscal establishment of the site that you selected in the Site field. The tax groups in the Sales tax group and Item sales tax group fields are also updated based on the tax matrix. This task uses the BRMF demo company.
