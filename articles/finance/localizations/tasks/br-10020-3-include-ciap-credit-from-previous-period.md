# Include CIAP credit from a previous period (Brazil)

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Use the CIAP fixed asset transactions page to create CIAP credit installments. If a CIAP installment wasn't included in a previous booking period, an installment must be created, so that the installment is processed as an ICMS tax assessment in the current booking period. This task uses the BRMF demo company.

1. Go to Fiscal books > Common > Booking period.
2. Click Create new booking period to open the drop dialog.
3. In the Fiscal establishment field, enter or select a value.
4. In the Month field, select an option.
5. In the Year field, enter a number.
6. Click OK.
7. In the list, mark the selected row.
8. Click ICMS.
9. Click ICMS tax assessment to open the drop dialog.
10. Click OK.
11. Click CIAP assessment.
12. Click Add line.
13. In the list, mark the selected row.
14. In the CIAP asset ID field, enter or select a value.
15. In the Date field, enter a date.
16. In the Transaction type field, select an option.
    * Select Credit of ICMS installment.  
17. In the Installment number field, enter a number.
18. In the Installment amount field, enter a number.
19. Click Save.
20. Close the page.
