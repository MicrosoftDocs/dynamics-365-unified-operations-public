# Customs declaration numbers
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can track customs declarations (CDs) from the time when goods arrive at the customs terminal through the time when they are shipped to the end customer.

The customs declaration number is one of the inventory dimensions that is manually entered when goods are received. For example, you enter it when you register the invoice with the facture from the vendor and then provide the appropriate field expenditure documents, such as the facture for a sales order, to the customer. In this way, the customer can trace the customs declaration number. The specified customs declaration number is also shown in the purchase book.

To do customs declaration accounting, you must activate the corresponding tracking dimension in the item's tracking dimension group.

The receipt and sale of goods can be done in various ways. For example, goods can be received through purchase orders from the vendor, and they can be sold to the customer.

When goods are received, their customs declaration numbers are manually entered. When goods are sold, their customs declaration numbers are automatically determined, based on the item lot. The customs declaration number that was used when the goods were purchased is shown on the documents that are created when the goods are sold.
