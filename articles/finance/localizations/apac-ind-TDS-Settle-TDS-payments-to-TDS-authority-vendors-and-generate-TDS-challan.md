### Example

The period 04/01/2009 is settled for the **Rent** TDS component group by using the periodic TDS settlement process. The total TDS amount of 141,625.00 is posted to the TDS vendor authority account for the TDS settlement period. You can view this amount in the **Amount** field on the **Open transaction editing** page for the TDS authority vendor.

If you select **Withholding tax transactions** to view the different TDS transactions that were settled for the period, the following information is shown.

| TDS amount |
|------------|
| 16,995.00  |
| 22,660.00  |
| 28,325.00  |
| 16,995.00  |
| 28,325.00  |
| 16,995.00  |
| 11,330.00  |

For a specific TDS amount, you can select **Withholding tax components** to view the TDS that was calculated per TDS tax component for a specific TDS tax code. For this example, you select **Withholding tax components** for the TDS amount 16,995.00. The tax amount that was calculated per component for the transaction is shown.

| Tax component | Amount    | Accumulated amount |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------|
| TDS           | 1,5000.00 | 125,000.00         |
| Surcharge     | 1,500.00  | 12,500.00          |
| PE-Cess       | 330.00    | 2,750.00           |
| SHE Cess      | 165.00    | 1,375.00           |

If you selected only the TDS amounts 16,995.00, 22,660.00, and 2,8325.00 for settlement on the **Withholding tax transactions** page, the total amount for settlement is shown as **67,980.00** in the **Correction** field on the **Open transaction editing** page. If this transaction is marked for settlement, and the **Open transaction editing** page is closed, the amount **67,980.00** is shown in the **Debit** field on the **Journal voucher** page.

You can now post the journal and generate the TDS challan.

### Adjustment of advance payments that are made to TDS authority vendors

To adjust an advance payment that was made to the TDS authority vendor to an actual payment, go to **Accounts payable \> Vendors \> All vendors \> Transactions editing**. If the actual payment that is made exceeds the advance payment, two challan numbers are generated for the transaction. However, only the first challan number is shown in the TDS inquiry.
