This topic explains how to set up and generate the value-added tax (VAT) declaration for legal entities in Germany.

## Set up sales tax reporting codes for VAT reporting

Set up sales tax reporting codes by following the instructions in [Set up sales tax reporting codes](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-reporting-codes.md). The following table provides an example of sales tax reporting codes for Germany.

>
> - The tax rate is more than 0 (zero).
> - The tax code is marked as **Exempt** on the **Sales tax groups** page.

## Submission the VAT declaration to ELSTER

ELSTER (Elektronische Steuererklärung, or electronic tax declaration) is a German online tax office system that was designed by the Federal Central Tax Office for online submission of tax declarations.

The [Developers area](https://www.elster.de/elsterweb/entwickler/infoseite/download_eric_28.) of the ELSTER website provides examples that show how developers can interact with ELSTER Rich Client (ERiC) for the submission of VAT declarations in XML file format. Examples are provided for C++, C\#, and Java. To access this area of the website, you must be [registered as a developer](https://www.elster.de/elsterweb/registrierung-entwickler). An example might help you create your own executable file that you can use to submit XML files via ERiC. To use an executable file to submit XML files to ELSTER, you must download ERiC dynamics-link libraries (DLLs).

For more information about ERiC releases, see [ELSTER website](https://www.elster.de/elsterweb/entwickler/infoseite/eric).
