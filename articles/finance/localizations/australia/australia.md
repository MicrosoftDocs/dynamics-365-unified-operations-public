## Business activity statement (BAS)
Australian businesses report taxation obligations to the Australian Tax Office using the Business activity statement (BAS). For more information about the business activity statement feature, see [Business activity statement](apac-aus-business-activity-statement.md).

## Low-value pool depreciation
Australia uses a low-value pool depreciation method. This method allows the allocation of low-cost and low-value assets to a low-value pool if the cost or opening adjustable value is less than a specified amount. For more information, see [Low-value pool depreciation](apac-aus-low-value-pool-depreciation.md).
