    - Dispatch ID
    - The last day of the selected period
    - Company's VAT ID without country/region code
    - Customer VAT ID
    - The total amount of items
    - The total amount of services

## Setup

For general setup information, see [EU Sales list reporting](emea-eu-sales-list.md#prerequisites).

### Set up information about the company

Create a registration type, and assign it to the **VAT ID** registration category for Denmark and all the countries or regions that your company does business with, as described in Registration IDs.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. In the grid, select your company.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Registration IDs**.
4. On the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
5. On the **Overview** tab, in the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that you created.
6. Enter your company's value-added tax (VAT) ID.
7. Optional: On the **General** tab, in the **General** section, change the period that the VAT ID is used for.
8. Close the page.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If the **VAT exempt number export** field in the **Intrastat** section of the **Foreign trade and logistics** FastTab is set (that is, it isn't blank), the value will be used, instead of the VAT ID that you created in step 6, in the .txt and .xlsx files for the EU sales list report.

### Import Electronic reporting configurations

- In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Index), import the latest versions of the following Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the EU sales list:
    - EU Sales list model
    - EU Sales list by columns report
    - EU Sales list by rows report
    - EU Sales list (DK)

For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

### Set up foreign trade parameters

1. In Finance, go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Foreign trade** > **Foreign trade parameters**.
2. On the **EU sales list** tab, set the **Report cash discount** option to **Yes** if a cash discount should be included in the value when a transaction is included in the EU sales list.
3. On the **Electronic reporting** FastTab, in the **File format mapping** field, select **EU Sales list (DK)**.
4. In the **Report format mapping** field, select **EU Sales list by rows report** or **EU Sales list by columns report**.
5. On the **Country/region properties** tab, select **New**, and specify the following information:
    - In the **Country/region** column, select **DNK**.
    - In the **Country/region type** column, select **Domestic**.
6. List all the countries or regions that your company does business with. For each country that is part of the EU, in the **Country/region type** field, select **EU**.
