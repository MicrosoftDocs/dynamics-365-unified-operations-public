You can define which document classes are allowed in transactions with vendors. You can also define the predetermined document classes for transactions with specific vendors.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up a vendor set, you must create the document classes that you will include.

## Set up a vendor set

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Vendors set**.
2. In the **Vendors set** section, in the **Customers/Vendors set** field, enter a code that identifies the set that you're creating.
3. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the set.
4. In the **Authorized voucher** grid, select the document classes for the set.
5. In the **Default vouchers** section, set the following fields to define the predetermined document classes that will be used when the vendor is used in a transaction.

    | Field                | Transaction                                |
