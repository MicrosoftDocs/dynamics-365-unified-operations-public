# Payment terms in commercial transactions report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up and generate the Payment terms report that is required for Polish legal entities. By January 31 of each year, some companies must submit a report about the payment terms of commercial transactions for the previous year. Companies submit the report through the tax authority application by entering the data that a wizard requests. The system will generate a report.

You can use the report to generate a summarized report and a detailed report to facilitate the manual entry of information in the tax authority application. Currently, there is no option for automatic integration with the tax authority site.

The Payment terms report is generated by using the Electronic reporting (ER) tool. The generated report is in Microsoft Excel format and includes the following files:

- **AP detailed report** – The list of payments that have been received within 30 days, within 31 to 60 days, within 61 to 120 days, and after 120 days.
- **AR detailed report** – The list of payments that have been made within 30 days, within 31 to 60 days, within 61 to 120 days, and after 120 days.
- **Summary report** – A consolidation of the AP and AR detailed reports, and payments that aren't received and made during the reported period.

## Prerequisites

Before you generate the report for the first time, download the following models and formats from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS):
	
- Statistics on invoices (model) version 41
- Payment terms model mapping version 41.1
- Payment terms report (PL) version 41.1

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about how to download ER formats, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

## Scenarios covered

Report generation covers the following scenarios:

- Customer and vendor transactions that are filtered by posting group and vendor or customer group:

	- Payments
	- Open transactions

- Payment days that are calculated in the following ways:

	- By payment or settlement date
	- By document or invoice date
	- Per installment, according to the payment schedule

- Amounts in the accounting currency
- Exchange adjustments, or revaluations that are included as part of the payment amount
- Project invoices
- Correction notes
- Compensation between vendor and customer accounts
- Advance invoices or prepayments

> [!NOTE]
> The report doesn't include credit notes that are fully settled.

## Run the Statistics on invoices process

Before you generate the Payment terms report, run the **Statistics on invoices** process from the **Accounts payable** and **Account receivable** modules to generate a specific view of the payment history. The Payment terms report uses this process to get all invoices that have been fully and partially paid. You can run the process in real time, or you can schedule it to run in the background through batch processing.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Statistics on invoices** or **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Statistics on invoices**.
2. Select **Calculate statistics**.
3. Select the "from" and "to" dates.
4. Select one or more vendor or customer posting profiles. Posting profiles let you easily include vendor or customer transactions for all vendors or customers, a group of vendors or customers, or a single vendor or customer on the report that is generated. To select all available vendors and customers, leave the field blank.
5. Optional: Select the vendor or customer group to apply an additional transaction filter. To select all available vendors and customers, leave the field blank.
6. Select **OK** to run the process.
