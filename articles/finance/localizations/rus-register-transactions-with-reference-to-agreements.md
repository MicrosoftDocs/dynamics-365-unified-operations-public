# Register transactions with reference to agreements
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you register sales, purchases, or incoming or outgoing payments, you can perform the following operations:

- Specify a reference to the agreement that the operation is performed according to.
- Settle customer and vendor transactions in the context of agreements that are specified during the registration of transactions.

After these operations are completed, you can analyze the turnover and balance of the agreement.

## Registering a payment from a customer or a payment to a vendor, and including an indication of the agreement

In the Russian localization, the **General journal**, **Slip journal**, **Vendor payment journal**, and **Customer payment journal** pages include a section that has information about the agreement. By using the journals that are listed, you can register a payment from a customer or a payment to a vendor, and include a reference to the agreement that the transaction is made according to.

As an example, the following procedure shows how to register a payment to a vendor through the vendor payment journal. However, the reference to the agreement is similar for all the other journals.

### Register a payment by using the vendor payment journal

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Payments** \> **Vendor payment journal**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **Lines**.
3. On the **General** tab, in the **Account** section, in the **Agreement ID** field, select the number of the agreement that the transaction is registered for.

The **Document title** field is automatically set to the title of the agreement.
