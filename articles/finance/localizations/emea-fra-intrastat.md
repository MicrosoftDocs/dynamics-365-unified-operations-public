# French Intrastat

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Companies in France that are registered for value-added tax (VAT), and that trade with other European Union (EU) countries, must declare the exchange of goods and services to and from France. The Declaration d'exchanges de biens (Declaration of Trade in Goods, or DEB) is a combination of the EU Sales List and the Intrastat report. You must submit this report monthly for all intracommunity sales of goods.

You can generate the DEB report in either of two electronic text file formats: SAISUNIC 330 or INTRACOM format.

The following table shows the fields that are included in the French Intrastat declaration in SAISUNIC 330 format. The table also indicates the report level of the field. The field can be **4** (simplified), **1** (full), or both.

    3. On the **Tax registration** FastTab, in the **Tax registration number** field, enter your company's tax registration number.

### NGP codes

On the DEB report, the codification of products consists of the following elements:

  - The eight-digit CN8 code that represents the tariff and statistical nomenclature of the EU.
  - If applicable, the one-digit Nomenclature Générale des Produits (NGP) national item code.

In 2021, the NGP applies to only three types of products:

  - Some products from cows, sheep, and goats
  - Military equipment
  - French wines

 You must set up the NGP codes and assign them to related products. The **NGP** field is then automatically set on the **Intrastat journal** page.

#### Set up an NGP code

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Foreign trade** > **NGP codes**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New** to create an NGP code.
3. In the **NGP** field, enter a single-digit code.
4. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the code.

#### Assign an NGP code to a product

1. Go to **Product information management** > **Products** > **Released products**.
2. In the grid, select a product.
3. On the **Foreign trade** FastTab, in the **Intrastat** section, in the **NGP** field, select the appropriate NGP code.

## Intrastat journal

Go to **Tax** > **Declarations** > **Foreign** **trade** > **Intrastat** to manage your transactions that are applicable to foreign trade with EU countries. For more information, see [Intrastat overview](emea-intrastat.md).

The **NGP** column is specific to France. It shows the NGP code for the product. If the NGP isn't applicable to a product, **0** (zero) is shown. You can adjust the NGP code. Select the transaction, and then, on the **General** tab, in the **Codes** section, in the **NGP** field, select the required NGP code.

### Intrastat transfer

On the **Intrastat** page, on the Action Pane, you can select **Transfer** to automatically transfer the information about intracommunity trade from your sales orders, free text invoices, purchase orders, vendor invoices, vendor product receipts, project invoices, and transfer orders. Only documents that have an EU country as the country or region of destination (for dispatches) or consignment (for arrivals) will be transferred.

Because the DEB report is a combination of the EU Sales List and the Intrastat report, it also includes *triangular* transactions, where a direct delivery is made from one EU country (party A) to another EU country (party C), and a French legal entity (party B) is in the middle of the triangular deal.

### Generate a DEB (Intrastat) report

1. Go to **Tax** > **Declarations** > **Foreign trade** > **Intrastat**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **Output** > **Report**.
