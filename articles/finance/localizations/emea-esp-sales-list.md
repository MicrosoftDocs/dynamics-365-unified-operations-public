### Set up company information
Create a registration type, and assign it to the **VAT ID** registration category for Spain and every country or region that your company does business with. For more information, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.

> The VAT ID that you created is used in the .txt file of the EU sales list report. If the **VAT exempt number export** field in the **Intrastat** section on the **Foreign trade and logistics** FastTab is set (that is, it isn't blank), the value of that field is used instead of the VAT ID.

## Work with the EU sales list

> [!NOTE]
> For services and triangular trade, the **Delivery code** field isn't available.

2. Transfer transactions.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Reporting**.
4. In the **EU sales list reporting** dialog box, on the **Parameters** FastTab, set the following fields.

### Create a corrective EU sales list report

2. Transfer transactions.
3. Select a corrective line, and then switch to the **Correction** view.
4. On the Action Pane, select **Edit**.

     - d is the declared base amount from the **Amount** field in the **Correction** view.
     - o is the amount of the **Items value** or **Services value** field after transactions are transferred to the **EU sales list** page. (In other words, it's the amount of the corrective document.)

13.	In the **EU sales list reporting** dialog box, on the **Parameters** FastTab, set the following fields in addition to the general fields that are used to generate a report.
