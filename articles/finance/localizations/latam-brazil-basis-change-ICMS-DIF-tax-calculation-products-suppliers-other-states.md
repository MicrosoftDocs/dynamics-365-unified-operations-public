# Basis change in ICMS-DIF tax calculations for products from suppliers in other states

This topic describes the configuration for calculations of the **ICMS-DIF** tax type when a fiscal document is received in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) or São Paulo (SP).

According to the definition in the state law, the Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) that is collected must follow this rule:

*ICMS to collect* = ([(*Operation amount* – *ICMS from source*) ÷ (1 – *ICMS % internal*)] × *ICMS % internal*) – *ICMS amount from source*

## Example

A Brazilian company in the RS state receives a fiscal document for a purchase from a vendor in the SP state. The company must collect the percentage difference of ICMS between the RS state (18 percent) and the SP state (12 percent). However, the base must be calculated according to the preceding rule.

- **Operation amount:** 1,000.00 Brazilian reals (R$ 1,000.00)
- **ICMS interstate:** R$ 120.00
- **ICMS percentage in the RS state:** 18 percent
- **ICMS to collect in the RS state:** (\[(1,000 – 120) ÷ (1 – 0.18)\] × 0.18 ) – 120 = R$ 73.17 

## Resolution

To calculate differential ICMS (ICMS-DIF) according to the rules of the RS state, you must set up sales tax codes and a sales tax group in the following way:

1. Create a sales tax code to receive the 12-percent ICMS (for the other state). This code is used to register the tax receivable amount from the vendor.
2. Create a sales tax code to collect the ICMS-DIF. This sales tax code should have a percentage amount of 18 percent (for your own state) to define the difference between 18 percent and 12 percent. Set the tax type to **ICMS-DIF**. This sales tax code must be defined in the following way in the calculation parameters:

    - In the **Origin** field, select **Percentage of gross amount**.
    - In the **Marginal base** field, select **Net amount per line** or **Net amount of invoice balance**.
    - Define the taxation code so that it has a fiscal value of **3**. In this way, the adjustment transaction will automatically be created when the **Fiscal books** module is enabled.
    - In the configuration of the sales tax group, select the **Use tax** option for the **ICMS-DIF** sales tax code.
