# Submit a VAT return in XML format to the Danish Tax Agency

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]
[!include [banner](../../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article describes how to prepare your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance environment to generate a value-added tax (VAT) return in XML format and submit it to the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen).

## Prerequisites

To automatically generate a VAT declaration in Excel or XML format, first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each box of the VAT declaration. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the Electronic reporting (ER) format for the VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes with the lookup results for the boxes on the VAT declaration. For more information about the structure of the VAT declaration of Denmark and lookup results for boxes of the VAT declaration, see [VAT declaration of Denmark overview](emea-dnk-vat-declaration-denmark.md).

Before you start to prepare your Finance environment for direct submission of VAT returns in XML format to the Danish Tax Agency, complete the required setup in [Preview a VAT declaration in Excel format](emea-dnk-vat-declaration-preview.md).

To submit your VAT return directly to the Danish Tax Agency, contact the Danish Tax Agency at <momsapi@sktst.dk>, and provide your Central Business Register (CVR) number. You can also learn more at [Skat.dk/momsapi](https://skat.dk/data.aspx?oid=2234574) (in Danish). The Danish Tax Agency will give you access to the test environment (endpoints and certificates) and provide a short guide about what you must do to gain access to the production environment.

## Set up Azure Key Vault for certificate storage

To submit your VAT return, you must obtain certificates from the Danish Tax Agency. These certificates must be stored in your Azure Key Vault storage. Follow these steps to set up Key Vault for certificate storage.

1. Go to **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **System parameters**.
2. On the **General** tab, set the **Use advanced certificate store** option to **Yes**.
3. Upload the certificate to Key Vault.
4. Go to **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Key Vault parameters**.
5. Select **New**, and enter values in the **Name** and **Description** fields.
6. On the **General** FastTab, set the following fields:

    - **Key Vault URL** – Enter the default Key Vault URL.
    - **Key Vault client** – Enter the interactive client ID of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application that's associated with Key Vault storage for authentication.
    - **Key Vault secret key** – Enter a secret key that's associated with the Azure AD application that's used for authentication with Key Vault storage.

7. On the **Secrets** FastTab, select **Add**, and create lines for Key Vault secrets for the Danish Tax Agency server and client certificates.

For more information about how to set up Key Vault parameters, see [Set up the Azure Key Vault client](../global/setting-up-azure-key-vault-client.md).

## Set up electronic messages

### Enable the \[EM\] Executable class action type feature

To submit your VAT return directly to the Danish Tax Agency from Finance, you must enable the **\[EM\] Executable class action type** feature in Feature management.

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Feature management**.
2. On the **All** tab, find and select the **\[EM\] Executable class action type** feature in the list.
3. Select **Enable now**.

### Get the data package that contains example settings for electronic messages

A data package is available that contains example settings for electronic message functionality that enables the following three scenarios in your Finance environment.

#### Scenario 1: Preview a VAT declaration in Excel without collecting sales tax payments (for any open period that has any from and to dates)

This scenario consists of the following actions.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DK VAT create preview in Excel | This action creates a new electronic message and lets you generate a VAT declaration in Excel format for a specified period. |
| DK VAT preview declaration | This action lets you generate a VAT declaration in Excel format for a period that's defined by the **From date** and **To date** values of the electronic message by running an ER format that's specified for this action. (By default, the **VAT Declaration Excel (DK)** ER format is used.) The generated report is attached to the electronic message. |

![Actions for previewing a VAT declaration in Excel without collecting sales tax payments.](../media/em-processing-preview-dk.png)

#### Scenario 2: Request information from the Danish Tax Agency about VAT obligation periods for the period that's specified in an electronic message

This scenario consists of the following actions.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DK VAT create calendar request | This action creates a new electronic message and lets you generate a request about VAT obligation periods (calendar) of the legal entity for a specified period and send it to the Danish Tax Agency. |
| DK VAT calendar request | This action lets you request information about VAT obligation periods of the legal entity directly from the Danish Tax Agency for a period that's defined by the **From date** and **To date** values of the electronic message by running the [EMVATSendCalendar\_DK](#calendar-request) executable class. The response from the Danish Tax Agency can be viewed in a web browser as an HTML file that's attached to the electronic message. |

![Actions for requesting information about VAT obligation periods from the Danish Tax Agency.](../media/em-processing-calendar-dk.png)

#### Scenario 3: Generate a VAT return electronic file and submit it to the Danish Tax Agency

This scenario consists of the following actions.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DK VAT create VAT return for submission | This action creates a new electronic message and lets you generate a VAT return of the legal entity for a specified period and send it to the Danish Tax Agency. |
| DK VAT collect sales tax payment records | This action runs the [DK VAT collect sales tax payment records](#populate-records) populate records action to collect the sales tax payment transactions that must be included in the VAT return. |
| DK VAT ready to generate VAT return | This action changes the status of the electronic message to **Ready to generate** so that an electronic file for the VAT return can be generated. |
| DK VAT Not ready to generate VAT return | This action changes the status of the electronic message back to **DK VAT new VAT return submission** so that sales tax payment records can be collected again. |
| DK VAT preview VAT declaration in Excel | This action lets you generate a VAT declaration in Excel format, based on collected sales tax payment transactions for selected electronic message, by running an ER format that's specified for this action. (By default, the **VAT Declaration Excel (DK)** ER format is used.) |
| DK VAT generate XML file for submission | This action lets you generate a VAT return in XML format, based on collected sales tax payment transactions for the selected electronic message, by running an ER format that's specified for this action. (By default, the **VAT Declaration XML (DK)** format is used.) | 
| DK VAT submit VAT return | This action sends the generated VAT return in XML format to the Danish Tax Agency by running the [EMVATSendReturnController\_DK](#return-submission) executable class. It then receives a link for further approval of the information that was sent. The received link is attached to the electronic message in HTML format. |
| DK VAT return approved | This action changes the status of the electronic message to **DK VAT return approved** so that receipt information can be received from the Danish Tax Agency. |
| DK VAT receipt request | This action lets you send a request about the receipt for the previously approved period directly to the Danish Tax Agency by running the [EMVATSendReceiptController\_DK](#receipt-request) executable class. The response from the Danish Tax Agency can be viewed in a web browser as an HTML file that's attached to the electronic message. |

    ![Importing the data package that contains example settings for electronic messages.](../media/em-package-dk.png)

8. Go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages**, and validate the electronic message processing that you imported (**DK VAT return**).

### <a id="populate-records"></a>Define a sales tax settlement period

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Populate records actions**.
2. Select the line for **DK VAT collect sales tax payment records**, and then select **Edit query**.
3. Use the filter to specify the settlement periods to include on the report.

### Save the executable class parameters for Electronic messaging

The **DK VAT return** electronic message processing uses three executable classes. These executable classes enable a connection to the three web services of the Danish Tax Agency.

- `VirksomhedKalenderHent` (*Company Calendar Download*) – Return dates that the legal entity must submit VAT returns by. These dates are required when VAT returns are submitted.
- `ModtagMomsangivelseForeloebig` (*Receive Provisional VAT declaration*) – Submit a draft of the VAT returns to Skat.dk, together with the required field information. The web service returns a deep link to Skat.dk. The legal entity can use this link to access and approve the submitted VAT returns.
- `MomsangivelseKvitteringHent` (*VAT declaration Receipt Download*) – Provide a receipt for the VAT returns, if the legal entity has approved them. This web service also includes information about how to pay an outstanding balance.

Before you use these classes for the first time, you must save the parameters.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messaging** \> **Executable class settings**.
2. Specify the parameters of each of the following executable classes by selecting **Parameters** on the Action Pane.

    | Executable class | Description | Parameters |
    |------------------|-------------|------------|
    | <a id="calendar-request"></a>DK VAT calendar request | This class retrieves company calendar information. | <ul><li>**Service url** – Specify the HTTPS address of an endpoint of the `VirksomhedKalenderHent` web service, as provided by the Danish Tax Agency.</li><li>**Client certificate** – Select a client certificate that's stored in your key vault.</li><li>**Server certificate** – Select a server certificate that's stored in your key vault.</li><li>**Request timeout** – Enter a suitable request time-out value, in seconds. If you leave the value set to **0** (zero), the default time-out of 60 seconds is used.</li><li>**Transaction identifier additional field** – Select **DK VAT transaction identifier**.</li><li>**Tax registration number additional field** – Select **Tax registration number**.</li></ul> |
    | <a id="return-submission"></a>DK VAT return submission | This class sends the VAT return to the Danish VAT return APIs. | <ul><li>**Service url** – Specify the HTTPS address of an endpoint of the `ModtagMomsangivelseForeloebig` web service, as provided by the Danish Tax Agency.</li><li>**Client certificate** – Select a client certificate that's stored in your key vault.</li><li>**Server certificate** – Select a server certificate that's stored in your key vault.</li><li>**Request timeout** – Enter a suitable request time-out value, in seconds. If you leave the value set to **0** (zero), the default time-out of 60 seconds is used.</li><li>**Transaction identifier additional field** – Select **DK VAT transaction identifier**.</li><li>**Tax registration number additional field** – Select **Tax registration number**.</li></ul> |
    | <a id="receipt-request"></a>DK VAT return receipt request | This class retrieves VAT receipt information from the Danish Tax Agency. | <ul><li>**Service url** – Specify the HTTPS address of an endpoint of the `MomsangivelseKvitteringHent` web service, as provided by the Danish Tax Agency.</li><li>**Client certificate** – Select a client certificate that's stored in your key vault.</li><li>**Server certificate** – Select a server certificate that's stored in your key vault.</li><li>**Request timeout** – Enter a suitable request time-out value in seconds. If you leave the value set to **0** (zero), the default time-out of 60 seconds is used.</li><li>**Transaction identifier additional field** – Select **DK VAT transaction identifier**.</li><li>**Tax registration number additional field** – Select **Tax registration number**.</li></ul> |

3. Select **OK** in the dialog box for each executable class to save the specified parameters.

![Saving the executable class parameters for Electronic messaging.](../media/exec-class-parameters-dk.png)

### <a id="security-roles"></a>Set up security roles for electronic message processing

Different groups of users might require access to the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing. You can limit access to the processing, based on security groups that are defined in the system.

Follow these steps to limit access to the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic message processing**.
2. Select the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing, and then, on the **Security roles** FastTab, add the security groups that must work with it. If no security group is defined for the processing, only a system admin can view it on the **Electronic messages** page.

### Set up a tax registration number

The **DK VAT return - Skattestyrelsen EM package** setup file provides the **Tax registration number** field for the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing. This field enables a VAT registration number that's independent of the legal entity's primary address and the registration ID that has been defined for companies that must report VAT returns by using the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing. Therefore, legal entities that have multiple VAT registrations can easily submit VAT returns that are specific to their VAT registration in Denmark. For more information about how to support filing for multiple VAT registrations, see [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md).

Follow these steps to define the VAT registration number that the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing must use to submit VAT returns.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages processing**.
2. Select the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing, and then, on the **Message additional fields** FastTab, in the **Tax registration number** field, define the VAT registration number that should be used to send the VAT return.
3. Save your changes.

If the VAT registration number isn't specified in the **Tax registration number** additional field of the **DK VAT return** electronic message processing, the system retrieves it from the registration ID that's defined in the properties of the legal entity that's associated with the **VAT ID** registration category. For more information, see [Registration type](../europe/emea-registration-ids.md#registration-type-creation) and [Registration category](../europe/emea-registration-ids.md#supported-registration-categories).
