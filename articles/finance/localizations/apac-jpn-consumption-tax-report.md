# Japan consumption tax report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up and generate the Japan consumption tax report for legal entities in Japan.

The Japan consumption tax report consists of two reports: **Consumption tax calculation sheet** and **Consumption tax report**.

- **Consumption tax calculation sheet** – This report corresponds to Table 2-1, "Calculation table of taxable sales ratio/deductible purchase tax amount."
- **Consumption tax report** – This report corresponds to Table 3-(2), "Consumption tax return form."

For a description of the calculation rules for Table 2-1 and Table 3-(2), see [Procedure 1 for preparing a tax return](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/zeimokubetsu/shohi/keigenzeiritsu/pdf/0018008-056_01.pdf).

## Prerequisites

To calculate the consumption tax report that should be submitted from October 1, 2019, you must enable the **Japanese sales tax report** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Setup

### Enable the consumption tax report

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Parameters** > **General ledger parameters**.
2. On the **Sales tax** tab, on the **Japanese tax reporting** FastTab, set the **Consumption tax reports** option to **Yes**.

### Enter Japan reporting information for a legal entity

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. On the **Registration numbers** FastTab, select **Edit**.
3. In the **Accounting personnel** field, enter a value.
4. In the **Company representative** field, enter a value.

### Set up sales tax reporting codes for consumption tax reporting

Set up sales tax reporting codes by following the instructions in [Set up sales tax reporting codes](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-reporting-codes.md).

The following table provides an example of sales tax reporting codes for Japan.

The "Where it's used for Consumption tax calculation sheet" column shows which **Item** field on the **Consumption tax calculation sheet** page and which row on the **Consumption tax calculation sheet** report (Table 2-1) each reporting code is used in. (For more information about the **Item** fields, see step 4 in the [Generate the Japan consumption tax report](#generate-the-japan-consumption-tax-report) section of this topic. For more information about the rows on the report, see step 15 in the [Example](#example) section.)

The "Where it's used for Consumption tax report" column shows which **Item** field on the **Consumption tax report** page and which row on the **Consumption tax report** report (Table 3-(2)) each reporting code is used in. (For more information about the **Item** fields, see step 8 in the [Generate the Japan consumption tax report](#generate-the-japan-consumption-tax-report) section of this topic. For more information about the rows on the report, see step 15 in the [Example](#example) section.)

    > The preceding configuration is just an example. The configuration that you use depends on the structure of the sales tax codes that are used. If you want values to be calculated and transferred to the sales tax report, for each tax code that is used in the sales tax payment process, you must set a relevant sales tax reporting code in one or more fields on the **Report setup** tab.

6. Post the following transactions.

    For example, for customer invoices, go to **Accounts receivable** > **Invoices** > **All free text invoices**. For vendor invoices, go to **Accounts payable** > **Invoices** > **Invoice journal**.
