# Import and export tax calculations

This article provides information about the import and export functionality of the tax calculation service. This functionality helps ensure a flexible and efficient configuration experience.

## Import and export tax codes

### Export templates

1. Sign in to [Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS)](https://marketing.configure.global.dynamics.com/).
2. In the **Globalization features** workspace, select **Features**, and then select the **Tax calculation** tile.
3. Select an existing feature, or [create a new feature](global-get-started-with-tax-calculation-service.md#set-up-tax-calculation-in-rcs).
4. In the **Versions** grid, select **Edit**.
5. On the **Tax calculation** feature page, set the [configuration version](global-get-started-with-tax-calculation-service.md#set-up-tax-calculation-in-rcs).
6. On the **Tax codes** tab, select **Import**.
7. Select **Export a tax code template** to download the **TaxCodesTemplate.zip** file.
8. Unzip **TaxCodesTemplate.zip**. The tax code templates are compressed separately according to **Calculation origin** value.
9. Unzip **By Net Amount.zip** to get the following comma-separated values (CSV) files:

    - **TaxCode.csv** – Enter the tax codes.
    - **TaxLimit.csv** – Enter the tax limits for each tax code.
    - **TaxRate.csv** – Enter the tax rates for each tax code.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, entries for the **Sample** tax code are available in the templates. If the **Sample** tax code isn't removed from the CSV files, it will be imported into the feature.
