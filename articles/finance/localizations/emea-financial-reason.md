# Financial reason feature extension

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the **Enable extended support of Financial reason code** feature that extends the **Financial reason** feature. This feature extension can be used globally in legal entities that have a primary address in any country or region.

In general, the **Financial reason** feature lets you set up a predefined list of financial reasons that can be used during document registration and posting in the system.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Financial reasons**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New** to create a financial reason.
3. In the **Reason code** column, specify a code to use for the financial reason when documents are registered and posted.
4. In the **Default comment** column, enter the comment that should be used as the default value in the **Reason comment** field for the financial reason. This comment should correspond to the reason code that is selected when documents are registered and posted.
5. In the **Ledger**, **Asset**, **Bank**, **Customer**, and **Vendor** columns, select the checkbox for each system module where the selected reason code must be available.

When the feature extension is enabled, it makes the **Reason code** and **Reason comment** fields available in an extended list of documents in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. It also stores the values of those fields in tax transactions that correspond to the posted document.

## Enable the feature

The **Enable extended support of Financial reason code** feature is available in the **Feature management** workspace in the following or later versions of Finance.

| Finance version | Build                                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 10.0.23         | 10.0.1037.36                                              |
| 10.0.22         | 10.0.995.75                                               |
| 10.0.21         | 10.0.960.114                                              |

To enable the feature, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Feature management**.
2. On the **All** FastTab, search for the **Enable extended support of Financial reason code** feature, and select it.
3. Select **Enable now** to enable the feature in your Finance environment.

After the feature is enabled, it's available in the following documents in all legal entities of your Finance environment:

- General journal (**General ledger** \> **Journal entries** \> **General journal**)
- Invoice journal (**Accounts payable** \> **Invoices** \> **Invoice journal**)
- Invoice register (**Accounts payable** \> **Invoices** \> **Invoices register**)
- Invoices approval journal (**Accounts payable** \> **Invoices** \> **Invoices approval**)
- Purchase order (**Accounts payable** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**)
- Sales order (**Account receivable** \> **Orders** \> **All sales orders**)
- Free text invoice (**Account receivable** \> **Invoices** \> **All free text invoices**)
- Project invoice proposal (**Project management and accounting** \> **Project invoices \> Project invoice proposal**)

Then, when tax posting occurs, the values of the **Reason code** and **Reason comment** fields of the preceding documents are stored in the **Tax transactions** table.
