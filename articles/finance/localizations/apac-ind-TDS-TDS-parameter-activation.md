2. On the **Direct taxes** tab, in the **Tax Deducted at Source** section, set the **Activate TDS** option to **Yes** to activate the TDS functionality, and the pages and fields that are used for it.
3. Set the **Invoice** option to **Yes** to activate the fields that are used to calculate and deduct TDS at the invoice level.
4. Set the **Payment** option to **Yes** to activate the fields that are used to calculate and deduct TDS at the payment level.
