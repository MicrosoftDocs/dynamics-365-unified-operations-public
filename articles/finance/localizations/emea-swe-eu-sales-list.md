The following fields are included on the Swedish EU sales list report:

- **EU sales list header**

    - Company VAT ID
    - Person responsible for the report
    - Primary email and telephone number of the person
    - Reporting period

- **EU sales list lines**

    - Customer VAT ID
    - Total amount of items
    - The total amount of services
    - Total amount of the triangular trade

## Setup

For general setup information, see [EU Sales list reporting](emea-eu-sales-list.md#prerequisites).

> [!NOTE]
> The company's tax registration number will be used in the .xlsx file for the EU sales list report.

### Set up company information

Create a registration type, and assign it to the **VAT ID** registration category for Sweden and all the countries or regions that your company does business with. For more information, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. In the grid, select your company.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Registration IDs**.
4. On the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
5. On the **Overview** tab, in the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that is assigned to the **VAT ID** registration category.
6. Enter your company's value-added tax (VAT) ID.
7. Optional: On the **General** tab, in the **General** section, change the period when the registration ID is used.
8. Close the page.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **VAT exempt number export** field in the **Intrastat** section on the **Foreign trade and logistics** FastTab is set (that is, it isn't blank), that value will be used, instead of the VAT ID that you created, in the .txt file of the EU sales list report.

For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

### Set up foreign trade parameters

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Foreign trade** > **Foreign trade parameters**.
2. On the **EU sales list** tab, set the **Report cash discount** option to **Yes** if a cash discount should be included in the value when a transaction is included in the EU sales list.

    - In the **Country/region** field, select **SWE**.
    - In the **Country/region type** field, select **Domestic**.
