# Use the CST and cClasstrib attributes in Brazil tax reform

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the **CST** and **cClasstrib** attributes in the Brazilian tax reform for 2026.

Brazil's tax reform introduces two new tax attributes to support the new tax types: CBS, IBS, and the selective tax.

- **CST** (Código de Situação Tributária) identifies the specific tax situation for a transaction. For example, it shows the applicable rate, an exemption, or a tax type.
- **cClassTrib** (Código de Classificação Tributária) categorizes the transaction for tax purposes.

Maintain both attributes to support tax calculation and ensure compliance with electronic invoicing required by the reform.

## Use the **cClasstrib** Form

This form supports CST and cClassTrib in the core tax system.

To open the form, go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **cClassTrib** to view the codes published by the government.
