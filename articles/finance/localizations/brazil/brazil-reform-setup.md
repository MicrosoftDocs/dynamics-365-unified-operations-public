## Hints

- Create and maintain reformed tax codes exclusively within the tax feature of the Advanced Tax Calculation engine (for example, CBS and IBS).
- Don't add legacy tax codes from the legacy engine into the Advanced Tax Calculation tax feature in Globalization Studio. Maintain legacy tax codes by using the established procedures in the legacy engine. Manage reformed tax codes only in the Advanced Tax Calculation engine.
- Changes that affect reformed tax calculation, such as adjustments to tax rates, modifications of tax types, or the inclusion of sales tax codes in sales tax groups or item sales tax groups, made in the legacy engine forms (sales tax codes, sales tax groups, item sales tax groups) don't apply during tax calculation.
- Modify **Settlement period** and **Ledger posting group** in the legacy tax module **Tax > Indirect tax > Sales tax > Sales tax codes**.
