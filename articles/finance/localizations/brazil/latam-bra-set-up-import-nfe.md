# Set up, import, and verify NF-e XML documents and DANFE

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

You can automatically extract and import the XML from the Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (NF-e) and its DANFE (Documento Auxiliar da Nota Fiscal Eletrônica) from emails sent by a vendor. The vendor must send these emails as file attachments during the time that the acquired goods are in transit.

The following prerequisites must be in place before you begin: 
 - Configure fiscal establishments in your legal entity. 
 - Set up NF-e federal parameters, including the IBGE code selected in the tax authority parameters.
 - Set up NF-e parameters for fiscal establishments.

> [!NOTE] 
> To use modern authentication to authenticate the connections to the POP3 server to read emails, complete the steps outlined [here](/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth) as a prerequisite to create an azure AAD application. The application you create will have the required mailbox permissions (POP) to read emails from the shared mailbox that you are using to receive emails sent by a vendor.
> Next, add the azure AAD application client ID, the client secret, and the tenant IDs as secrets to a key vault in azure and configure the same in Dynamics 365 Finance.

## Set up email accounts to import XML files and DANFE for NF-e
- On the **Configure email accounts** page, select **New**, and enter the account details.
   - **Server address** - Enter the POP3 server address for the email account.
   - **Port** - Enter the port number to use for the email server.
   - **Required SSL** - Select this option to indicate that the server requires a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted connection.
   - **Username** - Enter the user name for the email account.
   - **Password** - Enter the password for the email account.

- To support modern authentication due to the [deprecation of basic authentication in Exchange online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online), enter additional details.
   - **Use modern authentication** - Select this checkbox to use modern OAuth-based authentication to connect to the POP3 server.
   - **Server resource ID** - Enter the exchange server URI (https://outlook.office.com/ or https://outlook.office365.com/ ).
   - **Tenant ID** - Enter the key vault certificate reference for the tenant ID where the azure AAD application that has the required mailbox permissions is hosted.
   - **Client ID** - Enter the key vault certificate reference for the app ID of the azure AAD application that has the required mailbox permissions.
   - **Client secret** - Enter the key vault certificate reference for the client secret of the azure AAD application.
   - **Login authority** - Enter the login authority URI (https://login.microsoftonline.com/).

> [!NOTE] 
> Only Exchange online is currently supported to import XML files using modern authentication.
