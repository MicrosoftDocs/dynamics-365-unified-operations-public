## New Brazilian tax types

Brazil now has the following new tax types:

- CBS—contribution on goods and services. Federal: replaces PIS and COFINS (federal contributions).
- IBS—goods and services tax. States and municipalities: replaces ICMS and ISS.
- IS—selective tax (sometimes called excise tax or sin tax). Federal: applies to goods or services considered harmful to health or the environment, like alcoholic beverages, sugary drinks, and tobacco products.

## Implementation timeline and transition

Complementary Law No. 214/2025 enables CBS, IBS, and selective tax (IS). 

The transition period runs from 2026 through 2033. During that time, legacy taxes (ICMS, ISS, PIS, Cofins, and IPI) gradually phase out. 

In 2026, low pilot rates for CBS and IBS begin, along with preparatory obligations. 

By 2033, full implementation ends the legacy taxes and puts CBS and IBS fully in place.
