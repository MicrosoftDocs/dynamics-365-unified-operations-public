You can use the GB/T 24589-2010 export feature to export accounting data, including master data and transaction data, to several XML files for a specific period. Authorities or auditors can then import the XML files into their system to audit or verify a company's financial results.

Accounting data is exported into the following files:

   - Common master data.xml, which includes 12 data tables.
   - General ledger.xml, which includes 9 data tables.
   - Fixed assets.xml, which includes 11 data tables.

The following table provides more details about the content of each file.

   | **Common.xml** | **General ledger.xml** | **Fixed assets.xml** |
