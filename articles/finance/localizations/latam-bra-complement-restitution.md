# ICMS-ST complement and restitution process and declaration for RS, SC, and SP states

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), São Paulo (SP), and Santa Catarina (SC) have defined and implemented a new process for calculating and reporting the compensation and restitution of ICMS-ST tax amounts in internal operations to final consumers when goods are acquired under the Tax substitution regime (ICMS-ST). This process applies to retail and non-retail companies.

On a monthly basis, the taxpayer should, as a general rule, determine the difference between the ICMS-ST amount that is calculated in incoming fiscal documents and the ICMS-ST amount that is calculated in outgoing fiscal documents to the final consumer. Exceptions and specific rules might apply, depending on the state definition.

This difference between the incoming and outgoing amounts is known as the *ICMS-ST adjustment*, because the correction can be either positive (+) or negative (-), and it must be reported in SPED Fiscal or other related tax statements.

- Taxpayers need to determine the ICMS-ST tax amount to collect of the products subject to ICMS-ST
- The ICMS-ST calculated amount must be compared with the purchase ICMS-ST tax amount
- Depending on the result, taxpayers need to register the adjustment positive or negative
- Determine the ICMS-ST to complement or to restore

## High-level example

Purchase – Incoming fiscal document Base amount of ICMS-ST = 80.00

ICMS-ST calculated =\> 80.00 × 18 percent = R\$ 14.00

Sales – Outgoing fiscal document base amount = 90.00

ICMS-ST effective = 90.00 × 18 percent = R\$ 16.20

**ICMS-ST amount to complement** = R\$ 16.20 (ICMS-ST effective) – R\$ 14.00 (ICMS-ST from purchase) = **R\$ 2.20** (\> 0.00)

–or–

Purchase – Incoming fiscal document BC ST = 80.00

ICMS-ST calculated =\> 80.00 × 18 percent = R\$ 14.00

Sales – Outgoing fiscal document Base amount = 70.00

ICMS-ST effective = 70.00 × 18 percent = R\$ 12.60

**ICMS-ST amount for restitution** = R\$ 12.60 (ICMS-ST effective) – R\$ 14.00 (ICMS-ST from purchase) = **R\$ -1.40** (\< 0.00)

## São Paulo state implementation

A new tax statement, CAT 1219, was introduced by SP state. This tax statement requires that companies submit an ICMS-ST tax declaration monthly for tax complement and restitution of ICMS-ST amounts.

The statement file is generated based on version 1.1.0 of the guidance layout document.

### Scope

The following tables provide information about the records that are generated by using the CAT 1218 statement.

## Rio Grande do Sul state implementation

Through Decree 54308/2018, RS state established the procedure for calculating and reporting the complement or restitution of ICMS-ST tax amounts for contributors (retailers and non-retailers) that perform activities that involve goods that are subject to the tax substitution regime (ICMS-ST).

The state has defined two processes, one for retail companies and the other for non-retail companies.

### Scope

The ICMS-ST amount that is calculated for complement and restitution is reported in SPED Fiscal ICMS-ST in record 1900 and related adjustment records, such as records 1921 and 1923, because the state considers this process a sub-assessment of ICMS-ST.

## Santa Catarina state implementation

Through SEF Portaria No. 396/2018, SC state established the procedure for calculating and reporting the complement or restitution of ICMS-ST tax amounts for contributors (retailers and non-retailers) that perform activities that involve goods that are subject to the Tax substitution regime (ICMS-ST).

3. Go to **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Fiscal books parameters per state**, and then select the appropriated state (**SP**, **SC**, or **RS**).

### Presumed tax

On the **Presumed tax** FastTab of the **Fiscal books parameters per state** page, set the following parameters:

-  **Presumed tax calculation algorithm** – Select the method that is used to calculate the presumed ICMS-ST tax when outgoing fiscal documents to final and non-final consumers are generated and posted in Dynamics 365 Finance. This parameter is used to fill in the related tags when the NF-e fiscal document model.

    -  **Last purchase** – Use information from the latest incoming fiscal documents that were posted during the period.

-  **SPED Presumed tax calculation algorithm** – Select the method that is used to calculate the presumed ICMS-ST from ICMS-ST tax assessments that are created in the **Fiscal books** module:

    -  **Average** – Calculate the average amount from incoming fiscal documents. This method must be selected for SP or SC state.
    -  **Last purchase** – Use information from the latest incoming fiscal documents that were posted during the period. This method must be selected for RS state.

### ICMS-ST sub-tax assessment in RS state

For RS state, because the amounts and details about the calculation of ICMS-ST compensations and restitution are reported in SPED Fiscal in record 1900 and other related records, additional setup is required to automatically create the adjustment transactions that are established by Decree 54308/2018.

Go to **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Fiscal books parameters per state**, select **RS** state and then, on the **Sub assessment ICMS-ST parameters** FastTab, set the following parameters:

## Repro steps

### ICMS-ST tax assessment

Before you generate a statement for each state, you must create a fiscal booking period for the month, create the ICMS-ST tax assessment for the state, and then calculate any balances that are applicable in that state. If you want to create a credit adjustment related to inventory position, then mark as **Yes**, the **Credit inventory adjustment** checkbox in ICMS-ST tax assessment form before to confirm.

> [!NOTE]
> The credit adjustment related to inventory position is only applicable for RS and SC states.

![ICMS-ST tax assessment page](media/brazil-icms-04.png)

1. Go to **Fiscal books** \> **Common** \> **Tax assessment** \> **ICMS-ST**.
2. On the **ICMS-ST** page, on the Action Pane, on the **General** tab, in the **View** group, select **Presumed taxes balance**.

	![ICMS-ST page, General tab on the Action Pane](media/brazil-icms-05.png)

The **Presumed taxes balance** page includes fields that are required for reporting purposes. Here are some examples of these fields:

  - Item code
  - Product name
  - Dimension ID
  - Inventory dimension values
  - Inventory unit of measure
  - Quantities
  - ICMS tax rate and ICMS-ST base amounts
  - Amount per inventory unit and totals

  ![Presumed taxes balance page](media/brazil-icms-06.png)

On the Action Pane, on the **General** tab, in the **Calculations** group, select **Calculate inventory balances**. The system calculates the initial opening balance and the closing balance, and shows the values per item number.

Here is how the function for the opening balance calculation works:

1. Validate whether a presumed tax balance for the previous period exists. If no balance is found, the calculation is started. If a balance is found, the procedure considers the values from the previous period.
2. Select all items in on-hand inventory that have any transactions before the current period.
3. Calculate the quantity for every selected item on the first day of the period.
4. Find the last purchase for every item that has a ICMS-ST tax transaction.
5. By using the tax amounts from the last purchase and converting the purchase unit to the inventory unit, calculate ICMS and ICMS-ST amounts for the on-hand inventory quantity.

Here is how the function for the closing balance calculation works. This function is applicable only to SP state.

1. Delete old presumed tax balances for the period except those that are used for the next period. These amounts will be updated, and all other amounts will be recalculated.
2. Select all items in on-hand inventory that have any transactions during theperiod.
3. Search for the presumed tax for every item.
4. Calculate the balance in the previous periods to get the opening balance quantity. If there is no balance in previous periods, the opening balance quantity is 0 (zero).
5. Select all incoming fiscal documents in the period, summarize ICMS and ICMS-ST tax amounts, and summarize item quantities.
6. Calculate the average amount per unit by summarizing the totals of ICMS and ICMS-ST amounts in all incoming documents and dividing them by the summarized quantity in those documents.
7. Select all outgoing fiscal documents, and summarize their quantities. Then calculate ICMS and ICMS-ST tax amounts by using the average amount that was calculated in step 6.
8. Calculate closing balance amounts and quantities by using the values from the previous periods, and the sums of incoming and outgoing documents from the current period. These sums were calculated in steps 5 and 7, respectively.

#### Presumed tax calculation

After the balances are calculated for the first time, open the **Presumed taxes** page, and select **Calculate presumed tax**.

![Presumed taxes page](media/brazil-icms-07.png)

The page includes fields that are required for reporting purposes. Each tab shows the related fiscal documents that are applicable for compensation and restitution according to the criteria that have been established by state law.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Credit reversal** tab is applicable only to RS state and this tab shows Outgoing fiscal documents to non-final consumers, where taxation code = 60, and/or to final consumers, where ICMS = exempt or non-taxable taxation code \<\> 60.

The lower part of the page shows the total amounts.

![Total amounts shown on Presumed taxes page](media/brazil-icms-08.png)

Here is how the average algorithm for presumed tax calculation works:

1. Select all lines of all outgoing fiscal documents in the current period.
2. For every item from these lines, select all lines of all incoming fiscal documents that have the same item code in the current period. Then calculate the average ICMS and ICMS-ST tax amounts.
3. If no incoming documents exist in the period, consider the corresponding record in the presumed tax balances.

> [!NOTE]
> For SP state, the average values for sales complementary fiscal documents and purchase orders aren't calculated. Only the values from the original fiscal documents are considered.

#### Generate adjustments

For RS state, use the **Generate adjustments** button to generate the related tax adjustment that must be reported in SPED Fiscal.

Depending on the type of company business (retail or non-retail), Finance generates the related adjustments:

  - Debit for outgoing fiscal documents.
  - Credit for incoming fiscal documents.
  - Credit from the inventory position (opening balance). This tax adjustment is created one time and split into three installments.
  - Credit reversal.
  - Compensation and restitution (reversal).
  - Compensation in record E220.
  - Restitution in record E111.

> [!NOTE]
> After you select **Generate adjustments**, there is no way to revert to the initial state. To report record E220 or E111, you must manually reverse the adjustment transaction that is created during execution of the Generate adjustments function. The other adjustments that are related to debit, credit, credit for inventory, and credit reversal are created only for SPED Fiscal purposes. You won't able to see these transactions, because they are saved in a temporary table.
