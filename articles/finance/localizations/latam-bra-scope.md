# Scope of the Brazilian localization

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the strategy and scope for Brazilian tax, finance, and accounting laws and regulations that Microsoft has included in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance for Brazil. 

In general, Microsoft invests significant resources on extending the business process functionality of Dynamics 365 Finance by developing features and functionality to address specific tax, accounting, or financial regulatory requirements in countries or regions where Microsoft makes Microsoft Dynamics generally available.

The software helps organizations run their business operations while complying with country/region-specific laws, regulations, and common business practices for handling their daily activities. This software includes features and functionality that are designed to address specific federal tax, accounting, financial, or statutory reporting laws or regulations that commonly affect businesses in Brazil.

However, Microsoft Dynamics doesn't address all laws, regulations, or commercial requirements in Brazil, because laws and regulations vary in the way that they affect organizations. Additional details are available in the [Localization Availability Guide](https://aka.ms/ax-availabilityguide).

Channel partners are an important part of our global strategy for delivering Microsoft Dynamics to help customers meet local laws and regulatory requirements for Brazil. By taking advantage of the extensible nature of the development architecture of Microsoft Dynamics, channel partners can address a customer's specific business needs during implementation, either through configuration of the software (when configuration options are available), or through partner-created customizations or localizations (if customization or localization is required). Although channel partners might provide solutions that meet specific regulatory requirements that are unique to municipalities, cities, states, or other regions in Brazil, Microsoft doesn't provide any guarantees or warranties (expressed, implied, statutory, or otherwise) that partner-created solutions comply with local business, tax and regulatory, legal, or other applicable requirements.

Channel partners or customers are solely responsible for any configurations, customizations, localizations, or translations that they create or implement on behalf of customers. This responsibility also covers any updates for these solutions, and any support or other service that is provided to customers for such solutions. You must contact your channel partner for information about the solutions that the channel partner creates for licensed versions of Microsoft Dynamics.

## Definitions

**Customization** refers to either of the following:

- Any configuration, modifications, or changes that partners or customers make either to the Microsoft Dynamics software or, when applicable, to the software documentation to fit a customer's specific business needs. Examples include adding or renaming fields or tables, creating custom reports, or integrating with third-party solutions.
- Any software that partners or customers develop for the Microsoft Dynamics software.

**Localization** refers to any modification to, addition to, or adaptation of the Microsoft Dynamics software to enable or include specific features or functionality in the software so that it complies with applicable regulatory requirements (including, without limitation, versions and updates of the Microsoft Dynamics software, user assistance tools, and end-user documentation). Examples of laws or regulatory requirements that might require localization of the software include local tax reporting (such as for sales tax, value-added tax [VAT], and goods and services tax [GST]), invoice tracking by a government authority, government-required tax calculations, local accounting rules, and local regulatory and statutory reporting.

**National Standards** refer to feature requirements in software that are primarily related to banking practices (such as payment methods, payment formats, and bank statements). Less often, the requirements are related to commercial documents (such as electronic fiscal documents). National Standards are local requirements that aren't required by law or regulation, but that are widely adopted within a geographic region and critical to the sale of licenses for business management software in that geographic region.

## Brazilian localization strategy

In general, the Microsoft strategy for addressing the tax, financial, accounting, or statutory reporting requirements for Brazil consists of providing localizations for Microsoft Dynamics that do the following:

- They implement the federal tax requirements that are detailed in the [Brazilian localization scope](#brazilian-localization-scope) section of this topic.
- They implement, for the following states, the state/region requirements that are detailed in the [Brazilian localization scope](#brazilian-localization-scope) section: São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Paraná (PR), Santa Catarina (SC), and Rio Grande do Sul (RS).
- They deliver specific new regulatory features through configurations or development of new functionality that implements the federal and state/region requirements that are detailed in the [Brazilian localization scope](#brazilian-localization-scope) section, in accordance with the business rules that are specified in this topic and the Microsoft Dynamics roadmap on the [Microsoft Dynamics Localization Portal](https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/deployment/resources/productreleases/gfmlocalizationportalmc.htm?printpage=false&sid=xdtafwuk1xh2l5jdjhhv0joy&stext=gfm%20localization%20portal).
- They deliver specific new regulatory features in the most recent service pack that is available, or in a new service pack, for supported versions of Microsoft Dynamics.
- They apply National Standards and competitive features that Microsoft, at its sole discretion, determines to be necessary or appropriate, based on business needs in the region.
- They don't focus on the requirements of specific businesses, segments, verticals, regions, or large enterprises, even when these requirements are required by laws, statutes, or regulations at the federal, state, or city level.
- They don't include municipal requirements, except the municipal requirements that are detailed in the [Brazilian localization scope](#brazilian-localization-scope) section.

There are specific laws and requirements that are out of scope for Microsoft Dynamics. For a list, see the [Out of scope](#out-of-scope) section of this topic.

The Brazilian localization that Microsoft developed for Microsoft Dynamics is limited to the features and functionality that are described in this topic. Therefore, Microsoft Dynamics must be analyzed by prospective customers or a tax professional, such as an accounting and tax auditor, tax law firm, or tax consulting firms, who can assess whether the functionality is appropriate to meet the customer's business needs, or whether custom solutions are required.

## Brazilian localization scope

The user interface (UI) and online Help for Microsoft Dynamics are translated into Brazilian Portuguese. Additional documentation, such as white papers and training materials, might be available only in English and might not be available when the software is first made generally available in Brazil.

The localization scope for Microsoft Dynamics available in Brazil is limited to tax calculation, accounting transactions, issuing/receiving fiscal documents, and issuing fiscal receipts in the following four scenarios: procure to pay, quote to cash, retail, and regulatory/statutory reporting.

The features that Microsoft delivers and supports as part of the Brazilian localization for Microsoft Dynamics are listed in the [Brazilian localization features](#brazilian-localization-features) section of this topic. Details about each of the features can be found in Help in Microsoft Dynamics, and in white papers that are published on the [Microsoft Dynamics Localization Portal](https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/deployment/resources/productreleases/gfmlocalizationportalmc.htm?printpage=false&sid=xdtafwuk1xh2l5jdjhhv0joy&stext=gfm%20localization%20portal).

## Market availability

The Microsoft goal is to deliver regulatory features in enough time for installation. To implement the tax, accounting, financial, or regulatory/statutory reporting requirements that typically affect a majority of businesses in Brazil, Microsoft aims to release tax and regulatory updates that contain required changes before the effective date or other date that is mandated by the applicable government authority at either the federal or state level (but only for the states that are identified in the [Brazilian localization strategy](#brazilian-localization-strategy) section of this topic), so that our channel partners have enough time to update their customer solutions. Internally, we call this date the *market required date* (MRD).

Microsoft strives to meet its established MRDs and dates that are mandated by the applicable government authority. However, various factors can affect the timely delivery of tax and regulatory updates. Here are some examples:

- Legislative or regulatory changes that the government makes, but that it doesn't give enough notice about before the date when the law takes effect
- Feature, functionality, infrastructure, or architectural limitations of the affected software versions that are generally available in the marketplace
- The complexity and coverage of the coding, redesign, or enhancement that is required in the software to implement the legislation or regulatory requirements, or schedule conflicts

If it isn't feasible to meet these dates, we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and release tax and regulatory updates as soon as possible.

Any dates that Microsoft publishes are for planning purposes only and are subject to change at any time without notice.

Microsoft makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees about the timeliness or completeness of any tax or regulatory update that it provides, and, to the maximum extent that is permitted under applicable law, disclaims all implied warranties and conditions, such as implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
