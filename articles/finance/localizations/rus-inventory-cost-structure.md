# Inventory cost structure
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can save the item cost structure in inventory transactions as miscellaneous charges. You can then review the cost structure on the **Cost explorer** page. You can change the cost of inventory transactions by using the following functionality:

- Allocate miscellaneous charges from purchase orders and sales orders.
- Adjust the cost of inventory receipts by using the **Closing and adjustment** periodic operation.

When you allocate miscellaneous charges on a purchase order, inventory settlements are generated. You can then explore receipt inventory transactions in terms of miscellaneous charges codes. To work with the cost of inventory transactions, you must create a miscellaneous charges code for expense inventory transactions. The following system features are available for this purpose:

- Set the **Misc. charges structure** parameter to allow or disallow the creation of inventory settlements in terms of miscellaneous charges codes.
- Use the **Closing and adjustment** periodic operation to register a cost adjustment on inventory transactions or on-hand inventory that has miscellaneous charges codes.
- Use the **Cost explorer** page to view and explore a cost structure in terms of miscellaneous charges codes.

## Preliminary setup

### Set up the miscellaneous charges structure

1. Go to **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Inventory and warehouse management parameters**.
2. On the **General** tab, in the **Correction** section, set the **Misc. charges structure** option:

    - If you set this option to **No**, one settlement transaction, for the total amount, is generated for each receipt transaction. The miscellaneous charges code isn't entered in the inventory settlement.
    - If you set this option to **Yes**, inventory settlements are generated as miscellaneous charges codes when you post a purchase invoice.

### Set up a charges code in Inventory management

1. Go to **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Charges** \> **Charges codes**.
2. Create a charges code. Charges codes that you create in the **Inventory management** module have the following configuration limitations:

    - In the **Type** field in the **Debit** section, you can select only **Item**.
    - In the **Type** field in the **Credit** section, you can select only **Ledger account**.

## Adjustment of item cost in terms of miscellaneous charges codes

In the **Inventory management** module, miscellaneous charges can be allocated in several ways:

- Manually adjust on-hand inventory.
- Manually adjust transactions.
- Adjust on-hand inventory or transactions by using a wizard.

You can specify existing miscellaneous charges codes when you adjust item cost on the **On-hand**, **Adjust transactions**, and **Wizard for cost value adjustment of inventory transactions or entire on-hand inventory** pages.

## View item cost structure in the inventory settlements and cost explorer

On the **Settlements** page, you can view inventory cost adjustment transactions. As a result of inventory closing, receipt transactions are settled against issue transactions. After inventory closing is completed, you can open the **Cost explorer** page to view and explore the item cost structure in terms of miscellaneous charges.

1. Close the inventory as described in the [Close inventory](#close-inventory) section earlier in this topic.
2. Go to **Product information management** \> **Products** \> **Released products**.
3. On the **Released products details** page, select an item, and then, on the Action Pane, on the **Manage Costs** tab, in the **Cost transactions** group, select **Transactions**.
4. On the **Inventory transactions** page, select the transaction on the receipt item that you want to explore the cost structure for. Then, on the Action Pane, on the **Inventory** tab, in the **Costing** group, select **Settlements**.
5. On the **Settlements** page, review the following information:

    - The **Charges code** field shows the miscellaneous charges code that has been allocated to the item receipt transaction.
    - The **Vendor account** field shows the account of the vendor that the miscellaneous charges were bought from. For more information about how to buy miscellaneous charges from a third-party vendor, see [Third party miscellaneous charges](rus-third-party-misc-charges.md).

    - The **Invoice** field shows the invoice number of the miscellaneous chargespurchase.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Vendor account** and **Invoice** fields are blank, the standard method of miscellaneous charges allocation was used to perform the cost adjustment operation.

    ![Settlements page](media/12_Settlements.png)

6. On the **Inventory transactions** page, on the Action Pane, on the **Inventory** tab, in the **Costing** group, select **Cost explorer**.

    ![Cost explorer page](media/13_Cost_explorer.png)

On the **Settlements** and **Cost explorer** pages, the miscellaneous charges codes that have the **Item** debit type and the **Ledger account** credit type are shown as a separate line. The miscellaneous charges codes that have other debit and credit types are included in the item cost price as direct charges (standard functionality). They aren't allocated on the **Settlements** page. Therefore, they aren't shown as a separate line on the **Cost explorer** page.

If the **Charges code** field on the **Settlements** page isn't set, a charges code won't be shown on the **Cost explorer** page. If the **Charges code** field on the **Settlements** page is set, the charges code will be shown as a separate line on the **Cost explorer** page.
