# Mandatory default descriptions for posting of bank transactions

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The **(Brazil) Mandatory bank transaction description** feature lets you require that descriptions be entered in bank account reconciliation transactions. In this way, you can prevent bank transaction journals from being posted if they contain transaction lines that have no description.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, open the **Feature management** workspace.
2. In the list of features, search for **(Brazil) Mandatory bank transaction description**. If this feature doesn't appear on the page, select **Check for updates**.
3. Select the feature, and then select **Enable now**.

You can turn off the feature after it has been enabled.
