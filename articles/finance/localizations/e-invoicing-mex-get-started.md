# Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on for Mexico

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Electronic invoicing add-on for Mexico might not currently support all the functions that are available in the Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDI) document, and in the related integration that is built into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

This topic provides information that will help you get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on for Mexico. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) and Finance. It also guides you through the steps that you must follow in Finance to submit CFDI invoices through the service, and it explains how to review the processing results and the status of CFDI invoices.

## Prerequisites

Before you complete the steps in this topic, you must complete the steps in [Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on](e-invoicing-get-started.md).

## RCS setup

During the RCS setup, you will complete these tasks:

1. Import the e-Invoicing feature for processing CFDI invoices.
2. Review the format configurations that are required to generate, submit, and receive responses about CFDI invoices, and to submit and receive responses about cancellation.
3. Configure the events that support the CFDI invoice submission scenarios.
4. Publish the e-Invoicing feature for CFDI invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> "The e-Invoicing feature" is the generic name for the resource that is configured and published to consume the Electronic invoicing add-on server. In this case, CFDI invoices (MX) are the e-Invoicing feature that you will set up.

## Import the e-Invoicing feature

1. Sign in to your RCS account.
2. In the **Globalization features** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **e-Invoicing** tile.
3. On the **e-Invoicing Features** page, select **Import** to import the **CFDI invoices (MX)** feature from the Global repository.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the feature in the list, select **Synchronize**, and then repeat step 3.

![Importing the CFDI invoices (MX) feature](media/e-Invoicing-services-get-started-MEX-Select-Import-CFDI-feature.png)

When you import the **CFDI invoices (MX)** feature from the Global repository, all the feature settings, including configurations and actions, are also imported.

### Create a new version of the CFDI invoices (MX) feature

You can create a new version if, for example, URLs must be updated. For more information, see [E-invoicing CFDI](tasks/mx-00010-e-invoicing-cfdi.md).

- On the **e-Invoicing Features** page, on the **Versions** tab, select **New**.
