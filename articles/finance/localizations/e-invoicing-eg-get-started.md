[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information that will help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Egypt. The topic guides you through the configuration steps that are country-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS), and complement the steps described in [Get started with Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-get-started.md).

## Country-specific configuration for Egyptian electronic invoice (EG) Electronic invoicing feature

Some of the parameters from the **Egyptian electronic invoice (EG) Electronic invoicing feature** are published with default values. Review the values and if necessary, update the values to better reflect your business operation before you deploy the Electronic invoicing feature to the Service environment.

This section complements the **Country-specific configuration for Electronic invoicing feature** section in the topic [Get started with Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-get-started.md).

### Prerequisites

Before you complete the procedure in this section, you must:

- Create a digital certificate secret, as described in the **Create digital certificate secret** section in [Get started with Electronic invoicing service administration](e-invoicing-get-started-service-administration.md). For testing purposes, the Egyptian tax authority provides specific test digital certificates that must be used only during testing and solution validation phases. For more information, consult the Egyptian tax authority website using the link provided in the [Egyptian e-invoicing SDK](https://sdk.sit.invoicing.eta.gov.eg/faq/).

1. In RCS, in the **Features** section of the **Globalization feature** workspace, select the **Electronic invoicing** tile.
2. On the **Electronic invoicing Features** page, verify that the **Egyptian electronic invoice (EG)** Electronic invoicing feature you created is selected.
3. On the **Versions** tab, verify the **Draft** version is selected.
4. On the **Setups** tab, in the grid, select **Sales invoice** feature setup.
5. Select **Edit**, and on the **Actions** tab in the **Actions** field group, select **Sign json document for Egyptian Tax Authority**.
6. In the **Parameters** field group, select the parameter, **Certificate name** and select the name of the digital certificate created to use with the Electronic invoicing feature.
7. In the **Actions** field group, select **Integrate with Egyptian ETA service**. Repeat this step for the two occurrences of this action.
8. In the **Parameters** field group, select **Web service URL** and **Login service URL** and, if necessary, review the URL parameters. Consult the Egyptian tax authority website to get the Testing and Production URL, using the link provided in the [Egyptian e-invoicing SDK](https://sdk.sit.invoicing.eta.gov.eg/faq/).
9. Select **Save** and close the page.
10. To deploy the Electronic invoicing feature to the Service environment, see [Get started with Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-get-started.md).
