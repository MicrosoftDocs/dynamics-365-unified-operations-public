# Assessed tax declaration (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to the tax code of the Russian Federation, realty assets are subject to assessed tax.

The tax period for assessed tax is one year. The advance payments must be calculated and paid to tax authorities for the first quarter, the second quarter (six months or half year), and the third quarter (nine months).

At the end of the tax period, a company must report an assessed tax declaration that also includes information about the amounts of quarterly advance payments. Before the year 2019, at the end of each quarter, the company had to report an assessed tax advance payments calculation declaration. Starting from the year 2019, the assessed tax advance payments calculation declaration is canceled.

The assessed tax declaration should be submitted to one of the following tax authorities:

- The tax authority where the realty is located. In this case, the code **281** should be entered for the **at place of** attribute.
- The tax authority where the company is registered. In this case, the code **214** should be entered for the **at place of** attribute.
- If the organization is a greatest taxpayer, the tax authority where the organization is registered as a greatest taxpayer. In this case, the code **213** should be entered for the **at place of** attribute.

The tax base for the calculation of assessed tax is either the annual average cost of the realty asset or the cadastral cost of the realty asset.

The annual average cost is calculated as the sum of residual values (net book values) for the realty fixed asset on the first day of each month of the tax (or reporting) period, and on the first day of the month after the tax (or reporting) period. This sum is then divided by the number of months in the tax period plus one. Realty assets that are taxed at the annual average cost are reported in section 2 of the assessed tax declaration.

The cadastral cost is defined by cadastral authorities and should be specified by the user on the fixed asset card. Realty assets that are taxed at the cadastral cost are reported in section 3 of the assessed tax declaration.

    4. In the **Registration number** field, enter the OKTMO code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For realty objects that are located at the organization's main location, the tax authority that assessed tax is reported to is defined as the tax authority that has an OKTMO code that matches the OKTMO code of the legal entity.

### Optional: Set up company divisions, their registration reason codes (KPP), and their OKTMO codes

If the organization has realty objects that are located in territories that differ from the organization's main location, or if the organization has separate subdivisions, you should set up company divisions.

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Setup \> Separate divisions**.
2. Create a company division.
3. In the **Separate division ID** field, enter the identification code for the division.
4. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the division.

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Location**.
2. Select an existing location, or create a new location.
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Separate division ID** field, select the company division that you created in the previous procedure.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For realty objects that are located in territories that differ from the organization's main location, the tax authority that assessed tax is reported to is defined as the tax authority that has an OKTMO code that matches the OKTMO code of the separate division that is associated with the realty location. For information about how to associate a fixed asset with a location, see the [Specify the location of the realty](#specify-the-location-of-the-realty) section later in this topic.

If the **Separate division ID** field is blank, the location is the same as the location of the organization's head office.

### Set up territories for distributed realty assets

If a realty asset is distributed among several territories, it should be reported under the appropriate OKTMO code. You should set up distribution territories, assign an OKTMO code to each territory, and associate the OKTMO codes with tax authorities.

4. In the **Account for FA taxes** field, select a ledger account for the assessed tax expenses.
5. Make sure that the **Sales tax payable** field is set to the ledger account code that you entered for the ledger posting group in step 3.

## Create a realty asset and set up parameters for assessed tax calculation

Here is an overview of the steps for creating a realty asset and setting up parameters for assessed tax calculation:

1. [Define the date of including in the tax base for a realty asset](#define-the-date-of-including-in-the-tax-base-for-a-realty-asset)
2. [Register realty as a fixed asset](#register-realty-as-a-fixed-asset)

### Define the date of including in the tax base for a realty asset

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Parameters**.
2. On the **Tax reporting** tab, in the **Assessed tax** section, in the **Date of including in the tax base** field, specify when the realty asset should be entered in the tax base of the assessed tax register:

    - **Putting into operation date** – The date when the realty asset is put into operation.
    - **Date of the registration** – The registration date of the realty asset.

### Register realty as a fixed asset

#### Create a realty fixed asset and define parameters for assessed tax calculation

1. Select **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.
2. Select an existing fixed asset, or create a new fixed asset.
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Realty**.
4. In the **Flag of ownership** field, select whether the fixed asset is owned, under operational management, leased, or owned by someone who is outside Russia.
5. On the **Technical information** FastTab, set the **Date of the registration** and **Removal from the register date** fields.
6. Specify the cadastral value of the realty object. If the realty object is a room inside the building, also set the **Room cadastral value** field.
7. On the **Tax reporting** FastTab, in the **Assessed tax** section, in the **Asset kind** field, select the asset kind code of the realty.
8. In the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code for the assessed tax calculation.
9. If you partially own the fixed asset, in the **Owned share numerator** and **Owned share denominator** fields, define your ownership share as a simple fraction.
10. In the **Code by OKOF** field, specify the code from the all-Russia classifier of fixed assets.
11. In the **Privilege** field, specify the tax allowance of the **Exemption of tax** and **Tax base reduction** types, if these tax allowance types are applicable.
12. In the **Tax base** field, review the method of assessed tax base calculation.
13. On the **Address** FastTab, specify the address of the realty object. If the realty object doesn't have a cadastral number, the address is exported to section 2.1 of the assessed tax declaration.

#### Specify the location of the realty

By default, realty objects are considered to be located at the organization's location and reported to the tax authority in the legal entity's territory. (The OKTMO code of the tax authority matches the OKTMO code of the legal entity, and realty objects are reported under the same OKTMO code.)

If the organization has realty objects that are located in different territories and registered in different tax authorities, you must specify the location of the realty asset.

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.
2. Select the line for the realty asset.
3. On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **History** group, select **Transfer**.
4. Create a line, and set the **Date** and **New location** fields.

#### Specify the distribution for a realty asset that is located in several territories

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.
2. Select the line for the realty asset.
3. On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **Distribution** group, select **Distribution**.
4. Create a line.
5. In the **Location** field, select a territory.
6. Review the values in the **RCOAD** and **Sales tax code** fields. These values are automatically entered from the territory location record.
7. In the **Distribution share numerator** and **Distribution share denominator** fields, define the distribution share as a simple fraction. These fields will be used to calculate the realty's value in the territory.

#### Change the cadastral cost of realty that is taxed according to cadastral rules

The cadastral cost of a realty asset might change because of a change in qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Follow these steps to record the change in cadastral value.

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.
2. Select the line for the realty asset.
3. On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **History** group, select **Tax reporting data**.
4. Create a line.
5. In the **Period** field, specify the month when the cadastral value is changing.
6. In the **Cadastral number** field, enter a new cadastral number.
7. If the realty is a room in the building, set the **Room cadastral number** field.
8. In the **Owned share numerator** and **Owned share denominator** fields, define the new owned share as a simple fraction.

> [!NOTE]
> If this change is the first change in cadastral value, you must also create a line for the previous values that were originally entered in the fixed asset record. When the line for the change in cadastral value is created, corresponding fields in the fixed asset record can no longer be edited. They show the actual value from the tax reporting data history record.

## Calculate assessed tax registers

After you've finished the setup, registered the acquisition of realty assets, and set up all realty asset parameters for assessed tax calculation, you must calculate assessed tax registers. The following tax registers are available:

- **Cost calculation** – Depending on the method of tax base calculation, this tax register calculates either the net book values of each realty asset as of the first day of each month in the reporting period or the cadastral cost of each asset during that period. These amounts will be used as the basis for the tax base calculation for the tax amount that must be paid in the territory that is identified by the OKTMO code. The register also shows the following information:

    - The owned share, if the realty is partially owned
    - The distributed property share, if the realty is distributed (asset kind 02)
    - The ownership period and factor, if the realty was acquired or sold during the period
    - The cost change period and factor, if the cadastral cost changed during the period
    - The assessed tax rate, budget revenue code, asset kind code, separate division ID, and location of the realty, the tax authority that the tax for the realty will be reported to, the acquisition date of the realty, and the code for tax allowance through exemption from tax or tax base reduction

- **Totals of net book value calculation** – This tax register is a technical register that is calculated based on the data in the **Cost calculation** tax register. Depending on the method of tax base calculation, it shows either the tax-exempt net book values as of the first day of each month in the reporting period or the tax-exempt cadastral cost of the asset.
- **Assessed tax** – This tax register is the basis for an assessed tax declaration. It's calculated based on the data in the **Totals of net book value calculation** tax register. For each OKTMO code, budget revenue code, and realty asset, this register shows the following data that must be reported in the declaration:

    - The average cost and average cost of exempt realty, or the cadastral value and cadastral value of exempt realty, depending on the method of tax base calculation for the realty, and the code for tax allowance through exemption from tax or tax base reduction
    - The owned share, if the realty is partially owned
    - The distributed property share, if the realty is distributed
    - The ownership period and factor, if the realty was acquired or sold during the period
    - The cost change period and factor, if the cadastral cost changed during the period
    - The tax rate and the code for tax allowance through reduction of the tax rate
    - The tax base, tax amount (or advance payment amount), advance amount for previous periods, and code and amount for tax allowance through reduction of the tax amount
    - The tax amount that is paid outside Russia (This value isn't automatically calculated. If it's required, it must be manually entered.)

To calculate and approve assessed tax registers, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Journals \> Tax register journal**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Type of tax** field, either select **Assessed tax** to create a journal for assessed tax registers only, or leave the field blank to create a journal for all the asset's taxes (assessed tax, land tax, and transport tax).
4. In the **Period types** field, select one of the following values:

    - **Quarter** – Generate a journal for the assessed tax advance payments calculation.
    - **Years** – Generate a journal for the annual assessed tax calculation.

5. In the **Period number** field, if you selected **Quarter** in the **Period types** field, enter the number of the quarter. If you selected **Years**, enter **1**.
6. In the **Years** fields, enter the reporting year in the format *YYYY*.
7. Select **OK** to create a journal.
8. Select **Lines** to create lines in the periodic register journal.
