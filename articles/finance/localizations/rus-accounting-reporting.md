[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Set up accounting reporting

1. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2), in the Shared asset library, download the latest versions of the Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for accounting reporting.

    For example, to generate accounting reporting in XML format for the year after the 2016 reporting period, download the latest versions of the following configurations:

    - Financial reports model
    - Financial reports model mapping (RU)
    - Accounting reporting format 5.07 (RU)

    For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

2. Upload the Data management package settings.

    The data package contains the following items:

    - Financial reports and financial report cells for the balance sheet, the income statement, the equity statement, cash flow, and funds usage.
    - Electronic message settings for generating accounting reporting in electronic format.

    Follow these steps:

    1. In the LCS Shared asset library, select **Data package** as the asset type.
    2. Download the **RU Accounting reporting 5.07 (2016)** package. The file that is downloaded is named **RU Accounting reporting 5.07 (2016).zip**.

    6. In the **Upload data file** field, select **Upload**, and then select the **RU Accounting reporting 5.07 (2016).zip** file that you downloaded earlier.
    7. After the data entities are uploaded, select **Import**.

3. Go to **General ledger \> Financial reports setup \> Financial reports**, and validate the financial reports that are imported. (All the data that is imported is presented only in the Russian language.)
