# Onboarding for electronic invoicing in Saudi Arabia (preview)

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]
[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Onboarding is mandatory for all taxpayers who are subject to electronic invoicing in Saudi Arabia. As a result of the onboarding process, taxpayers obtain Cryptographic Stamp Identifiers (CSIDs). CSIDs are required for integration with the electronic invoicing portal that the Saudi Arabian tax authority (Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority \[ZATCA\]) manages, and for further submission of electronic invoices.

This article explains how to onboard taxpayers and their electronic invoicing software with ZATCA.

## Prerequisites

- The legal entity must be registered as a taxpayer in Saudi Arabia and must have a valid value-added tax (VAT) registration number.
- The legal entity must have the access to the [Saudi Arabian Taxation Portal (ERAD)](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/).

## Onboarding process

The onboarding process consists of two steps:

1. Obtain a Compliance CSID (CCSID), which ZATCA assigns to perform compliance checks on electronic invoice generation solutions (EGSs).
1. Obtain a Production CSID (PCSID), which ZATCA assigns to compliant EGSs.

### Obtain a CCSID

1. In the [Saudi Arabian Taxation Portal (ERAD)](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/), go to the Onboarding and Management Portal by selecting the relevant tile.
1. On the main landing page of the Onboarding and Management Portal, select the **Onboard new solution unit/device** tile, and then select **Generate OTP code**.
1. Select the number of one-time password (OTP) codes to generate. The number depends on the number of e-invoicing generation units (devices) that will be used.
1. Save the generated OTP codes so that you can use them in later steps.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > OTP codes are valid for only one hour after they're generated. Make sure that you use them within that time.

1. Prepare a configuration file for the certificate signing request (CSR). This configuration file should be in the form of a plain text file that contains the following data.

    ```txt
    oid_section = OIDs
    [OIDs]
    certificateTemplateName = 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2
    [req]
    default_bits = 2048
    emailAddress = MyEmail@email.com
    req_extensions = v3_req
    x509_extensions = v3_ca
    prompt = no
    default_md = sha 256
    req_extensions = req_ext
    distinguished_name = dn
    [dn]
    C=SA
    OU=Riyad Branch
    O=Contoso
    CN=EA123456789
    [v3_req]
    basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
    keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment
    [req_ext]
    certificateTemplateName = ASN1:PRINTABLESTRING:ZATCA-Code-Signing
    subjectAltName = dirName:alt_names
    [alt_names]
    SN=1-TST|2-TST|3-ed22f1d8-e6a2-1118-9b58-d9a8f11e445f
    UID=310122393500003
    title=1100
    registeredAddress= MyAddress
    businessCategory=Industry
    ```

1. Save the CSR configuration file to the same location as the onboarding script, and name it **csr\_config.txt**.
1. In the CSR configuration file, update the **emailAddress** value and the following data.

    | Code              | Description | Specification |
    |-------------------|-------------|---------------|
    | C                 | The country/region code. | A two-letter code (ISO 3166 Alpha-2). |
    | OU                | The name of the organization unit. | For normal taxpayers, the value is free text. For VAT groups, identify the value through the fact that the eleventh digit of the organization identifier is "1". Validate that the input is a 10-digit Tax Identification Number (TIN). |
    | O                 | The name of the organization or taxpayer. | Free text. |
    | CN                | The unique name of the solution or unit. | Free text. |
    | SN                | The unique identification code for the solution. | Free text. |
    | UID               | The VAT registration number of the taxpayer. | A 15-digit number that begins with "3" and ends with "3". |
    | title             | The document type that the taxpayer's solution unit will issue. | Four-digit numerical input that uses "0" and "1" mapped to "TSCZ": "0" = False/Not supported, and "1" = True/Supported. "T" = Tax invoice (standard), "S" = Simplified tax invoice, "C" = For future use, and "Z" = For future use. |
    | registeredAddress | The address of the branch or location where the device or solution unit is primarily situated. | Free text. |
    | businessCategory  | The industry or sector that the device or solution will generate invoices for. | Free text. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you use the simulation portal, the values for **CN** and **certificateTemplateName** in the CSR configuration file differ.
    >
    > In the simulation portal, use the following values:
    >
    > - **CN:** PREZATCA-Code-Signing
    > - **certificateTemplateName:** ASN1:PRINTABLESTRING:PREZATCA-Code-Signing
    >
    > For all other cases, use the values that were provided earlier.

1. Run the [onboarding script](#script) that's provided later in this article. Specify the OTP code and the CSR configuration file as input parameters. Here's an example.

    `.\OnboardingScript.ps1 -action getComplianceCSID -otp 123345 -csrconfig .\csr_config.txt -password 123`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **password** parameter is optional and can be omitted. If it's included, the certificate that's generated will have the specified password.

1. You receive the CCSID as a certificate file, **CCSID.pfx**. The secret for the CCSID is saved as a text file, **CCSIDSecret.txt**. Save the CCSID certificate file in the Microsoft Azure Key Vault certificate, and save the secret in the Key Vault secret. For more information, see [Customer certificates and secrets](../global/e-invoicing-customer-certificates-secrets.md).
1. Configure the related feature setup in the **Saudi Arabian ZATCA compliance check (SA)** Electronic invoicing feature, and reference the CCSID certificate that you saved in the key vault. The certificate will be used for communication with the ZATCA electronic invoicing portal.

### Compliance check

After you obtain a CCSID by using the PowerShell script, ZATCA requires that you complete specific compliance checks by submitting sample invoices. This step is a prerequisite for requesting a PCSID.

Ensure that all types of sample invoices that you configured in the CSR configuration file are successfully submitted to ZATCA. Use the standard process for issuing electronic invoices. For more information, see [Issue electronic invoices in Finance and Supply Chain Management](../global/e-invoicing-submit-electronic-documents.md).

Follow the steps in [Electronic invoicing in Saudi Arabia - Phase two](gs-e-invoicing-sa-get-started.md). Use the **Saudi Arabian ZATCA compliance check (SA)** Electronic invoicing feature and the CCSID that you obtain.

After the compliance checks are successfully completed, use the PowerShell script to obtain a PCSID. (See the [onboarding script](#script) that's provided later in this article.)

> [!NOTE]
> If the document type in the **title** field of the CSR configuration file is set to **1000**, you must submit the following three sample invoices for the compliance check:
>
> - Standard Tax Invoice
> - Standard Debit Note
> - Standard Credit Note
>
> If the document type is set to **0100**, you must submit the following three sample invoices for the compliance check:
>
> - Simplified Tax Invoice
> - Simplified Debit Note
> - Simplified Credit Note
>
> If the document type is set to **1100**, you must submit all six sample invoices for the compliance check.

### Obtain a PCSID

To obtain a PCSID, you must correctly configure the solution for electronic invoice generation and submission, and the solution must be fully functioning. To achieve this result, you must complete all the required preliminary configuration steps. For more information, see [Electronic invoicing in Saudi Arabia - Phase two](GS-e-invoicing-sa-get-started.md).

1. Make sure that all electronic invoices are successfully submitted to ZATCA.
1. Run the [onboarding script](#script) that's provided later in this article. Specify the CCSID as an input parameter. Here's an example.

    `.\OnboardingScript.ps1 -action getProductionCSID -password 123`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **password** parameter is optional and can be omitted. If it's included, the certificate that's generated will have the specified password.

1. You receive the PCSID as a certificate file in PFX format. Save this PCSID certificate and secret file in the key vault.
1. Configure the related feature setup in the **Saudi Arabian Zatca submission (SA)** Electronic invoicing feature. Include the PCSID certificate and secret in the Key Vault parameters.

After you complete all the configurations steps, the system is ready to be used in production mode.

To review the obtained CSIDs on the ZATCA side, use the **Review Existing Cryptographic Stamp Identifier (CSID)** tile on the landing page of the Onboarding and Management Portal. This portal is accessible from the main [Saudi Arabian Taxation Portal (ERAD)](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/).
