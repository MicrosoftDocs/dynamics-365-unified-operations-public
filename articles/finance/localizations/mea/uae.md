This article provides links to documentation resources for the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

## Activate the UAE functionality

Country-specific functionality for the UAE is activated by using the **Localized functionality region** configuration for legal entities. If the company address is used to detect the **Localized functionality region** configuration, make sure that the country/region code of the legal entity's primary address is set to **ARE** on the **Legal entities** page.

For more information about the patterns that are used in localized solutions, see the [Localization and regulatory features website](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/lcs/country-region.md).
