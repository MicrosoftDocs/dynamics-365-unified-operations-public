# Electronic invoicing for Singapore

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article helps you get started with electronic invoicing for Singapore. Set up the system to generate, submit, and receive electronic invoices in the Singaporean extension of the [PEPPOL International (PINT)](https://www.peppolguide.sg/billing/) format in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance by using the last mile connector.

:::image type="content" source="../media/apac-sgp-einoices-flow.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the e-invoice flow for Singapore.":::

> [!NOTE]
> This electronic invoicing approach uses an invoicing service that's applicable only to cloud deployments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure these prerequisites are in place:

- The company is a registered taxpayer in Singapore.
- The company has a signed agreement with the electronic document delivery service provider that supports document interchange in the PEPPOL (PINT) format.
- Register the following profile ID for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance electronic document interchange:

    - **urn:peppol:bis:billing** – Use this profile to interchange documents in PEPPOL (PINT) format.

- Get the credentials from the service provider to integrate the Electronic Invoicing service with the [Electronic Invoicing service independent software vendor (ISV) last-mile connector](../global/e-invoicing-isv-connector.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > This implementation assumes [Edicom](https://edicomgroup.com/electronic-invoicing) is the Electronic Invoicing ISV last-mile connection service provider. For more information, see [Edicom integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://edicomgroup.com/edicom-microsoft?365).

- Learn about Electronic Invoicing in the [Electronic Invoicing service overview](../global/gs-e-invoicing-service-overview.md) and [Electronic invoicing components](../global/gs-e-invoicing-administration-integration-components.md).
- Complete the common Electronic Invoicing service configuration in [Electronic invoicing configuration](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

## Create the Azure Key Vault configuration

Create an Azure Key Vault to store required company secrets. For more information, see [Configure Azure resources for Electronic invoicing](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-azure-resources.md).

Add the following element to the key vault:

- Add the secret for the **token** that authorizes access to Edicom services. Obtain it from Edicom as described in the prerequisites.

## Set up electronic invoicing Key Vault parameters

Set up electronic invoicing Key Vault parameters.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
1. On the **Electronic invoicing** tab, in **Key Vault settings**, in **Key Vault**, select the key vault reference you created earlier.
1. In **SAS token secret**, select the storage account secret URL used to authenticate access to the storage account.
1. Select **Key Vault parameters**.
1. On the **Key Vault parameters** page, in **Certificates**, select **Add** and create an element of the appropriate type for each secret described earlier.

    - <a id="Tok"></a>Add the **token** element of type **Secret**.

> [!NOTE]
> Match the value in the **Name** column to the secret name described earlier.

## Import the electronic invoicing feature

1. Go to **Globalization Studio** and select the **Electronic invoicing** tile. Import the latest version of the **Singaporean electronic invoice (SG)** globalization feature as described in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
1. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, on the **Reporting configurations** tile, confirm that the following Electronic reporting configurations are imported as a result of the **Singaporean electronic invoice (SG)** globalization feature import.

    - **Invoice model**
    - **Invoice model mapping**
    - **PINT Sales e-invoice** 
    - **PINT Sales e-credit note**
    - **PINT Project e-invoice**
    - **PINT Project e-credit note**
    - **Customer invoice context model**
    - **Response message model**
    - **Edicom Response Processing**
    - **Error log import Json**

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the configurations aren't imported, import them manually as described in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).

1. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, on the **Reporting configurations** tile, import the latest versions of the following Electronic reporting configurations to receive incoming vendor invoices.

    - **Vendor invoice import**
    - **Vendor invoice Mapping to destination**
    - **Import invoice context model**
    
## Configure the electronic invoicing feature

The **Singaporean electronic invoice (SG)** feature publishes some parameters with default values. Before you deploy the feature, review the default values and update them so they reflect your business operations.

Review and update the **Singaporean electronic invoice (SG)** feature configuration:

1. Go to **Globalization Studio** and select the **Electronic invoicing** tile. Import the globalization feature as described in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
1. Copy the imported **Singaporean electronic invoice (SG)** globalization feature and select your configuration provider, as described in [Create a Globalization feature](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-new-globalization-feature.md).
1. On the **Versions** tab, check that the **Draft** version is selected.
1. On the **Feature parameters** tab, specify these required **Edicom** connection and integration parameters:

    - **Service ID** – Use the service ID (Domain) number from Edicom to identify the company.
    - **Group** – Use the group code for internal routing within the Edicom infrastructure.
    - **Destination** – Construct the destination by appending **_EDIWIN** to the service ID number. For example, if the service ID number is **123456**, enter **123456_EDIWIN**.
    - **Token** – Select the name of the [token](#Tok) you created earlier.

    :::image type="content" source="apac-sgp-einv-feature-parameters.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the Feature parameters tab configured for the Globalization feature for Singapore.":::
