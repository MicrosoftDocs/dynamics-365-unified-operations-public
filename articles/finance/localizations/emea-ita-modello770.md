# Modello 770 report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up, create, and export the Model 770 report that is used to report withholding tax.

The Model 770 report is an annual report that provides information about the taxes that a company withholds when it pays contractors and self-employed vendors. Companies remit the withheld taxes directly to the government throughout the year. Then, at the end of the year, the company creates and transmits the Model 770 report. This report itemizes the payments that were made to each contractor and self-employed vendor, and the taxes that were withheld from those payments. The Model 770 report contains information only about contractors and self-employed vendors for whom taxes were withheld from payments.

## General settings that are required for the Model 770 report
Complete the following tasks before you create a Model 770 report:

- Set up withholding tax codes, withholding tax groups, withholding tax limits, and withholding tax values. For more information, see [Set up withholding tax](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-withholding-tax.md) and [Withholding tax for Italy](emea-ita-withholding-tax.md).
- Pay vendor invoices, and withhold taxes from the payments.
- Set up Italian sales tax books. For more information, see [Italian sales tax books](emea-ita-fiscal-books.md).

## Set up address information
Use the **Address setup** page to set up the country/region code, state and region codes, and county and municipality codes for a contractor or self-employed vendor who should be included on a Model 770 report. You must set up address information for all contractors and self-employed vendors for whom you withhold taxes from payments. For information about the address codes, see the instructions that the Italian government has published for the Model 770 report on the [Italian Revenue Agency](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it) website.

1. Select **Organization administration** > **Addresses** > **Address setup**.
2. Select **Country/region**, and then, in the **Country/region** field, enter the two-letter International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country/region code for Italy.
3. Select **State/province**, and then enter the identification code of the state and the two-digit IT region code for the contractors or self-employed vendors.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use the numeric state code, not the state abbreviation.

4. Select **County**, and then, in the **IT county code** field, enter the two-letter ISO county code for the contractors or self-employed vendors.
5. Select **City**, and then, in the **IT municipality code** field, enter the four-character Italian municipality code for the contractors or self-employed vendors. The municipality code consists of a letter and three numbers.
6. Select the **ZIP/postal codes** link, and then, in the **ZIP/postal code** field, enter the Italian postal code.

## Set up a fiscal code for the legal entity
The fiscal code is included on the Model 770 report so that the Italian government can identify your legal entity.

1. Select **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. On the **Registration numbers** FastTab, in the **Fiscal code** field for Italy, enter the fiscal code of the legal entity.

## Set up a number sequence for the Model 770 report
Use the **General ledger parameters** page to set up a number sequence for the Model 770 report.

1. Select **General ledger** > **Ledger setup** > **General ledger parameters**.
2. Select the **Number sequences** link, and then, in the **Number sequence code** field, select a number sequence for the **Model ID** reference.

## Set up related information for vendors
1. Select **Accounts payable** > **Vendors** > **All vendors**, and then select a required vendor.
2. On the **Invoice and delivery** FastTab, in the **Fiscal code** field, enter the fiscal code of the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For self-employed vendors who aren't required to pay value-added tax (VAT), enter the personal fiscal code of the individual. If a vendor is required to pay VAT, enter the VAT registration number (partita IVA) that the Italian tax authority provides as the fiscal code of the vendor.

3. On the **Invoice and delivery** FastTab, select the **Calculate withholding tax** check box. Select a withholding tax group to activate the calculation when a payment is entered.
4. On the **Purchasing demographics** FastTab, select the county where the vendor was born.
5. If the vendor is an heir to the company, select the **Heir** check box.
