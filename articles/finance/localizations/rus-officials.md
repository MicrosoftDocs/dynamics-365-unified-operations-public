[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up officials in Russia who generate transportation invoices and job tickets and who are involved in various reports.

## Set up officials who generate transportation invoices and job tickets

This procedure applies to features in the **Inventory management** module. It doesn't apply to features in [Warehouse management overview](../../supply-chain/warehousing/warehouse-management-overview.md).

Use the **Officials** page to set up the officials who are involved in the transportation of cargo. You can select the officials who are responsible for intercompany and intracompany transactions.

You must set up records for the officials who are responsible for transportation on both sides of the transactions. Therefore, you must set up records for the officials both on the customer or vendor side, and on the company side. This information is required when you generate and print a transportation invoice and a job ticket that are based on a bill of lading.

1. Select **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Contacts** \> **Officials**.
2. To set up records for the officials who are responsible for transportation on outgoing documents for customers, on the **Sales orders** tab, select either **Invoice** or **Invoice - credit-note**, and then follow these steps:

4. To set up records for the officials who are responsible for transportation on incoming or outgoing warehouse documents, on the **Inventory item management** tab, select either **Issue slip for sales order (M-15)** or **Issue slip for transfer order (M-15)**, and then follow these steps:

    1. Create a record for an official. In the **Position** field, select **Customer transportation responsible**.
    2. In the **Name** field, select the customer contact who is responsible for transportation.
