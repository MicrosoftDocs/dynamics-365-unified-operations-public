This article provides information that will help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Australia and New Zealand. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. These steps complement the steps that are described in [Set up Electronic invoicing](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

After you configure Electronic invoicing, you can generate XML files of electronic invoices by using the [Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL)](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/) format specification with the Australian and New Zealand extension.

> [!NOTE]
> The electronic invoicing approach that this article describes is implemented by using an invoicing service that's applicable only to cloud deployments of Finance or Supply Chain Management. For on-premises deployments, see [Customer electronic invoices in Australia and New Zealand](apac-aus-nzl-e-invoices.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the procedures in this article, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Become familiar with Electronic invoicing as it's described in [Electronic invoicing overview](../global/gs-e-invoicing-service-overview.md).
- Do the common part of Electronic Invoicing service configuration as described in [Set up Electronic invoicing](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

## Country/region-specific configuration for the Electronic invoicing for Australia and New Zealand feature

Some of the parameters from the **Electronic invoicing for Australia and New Zealand** Electronic invoicing feature are published with default values. Before you deploy this feature to the service environment, review the default values, and update them as required, so that they better reflect your business operations.

1. Import the latest version of the **Electronic invoicing for Australia and New Zealand** Globalization feature as described in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
1. Create a copy of the imported Globalization feature, and select your configuration provider for it. For more information, see [Create a Globalization feature](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-new-globalization-feature.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Electronic invoicing for Australia and New Zealand** feature is provided by Microsoft. It's ready to use and requires no additional configuration. For information about how to configure invoicing features if you must apply changes, see [Work with feature setups](../global/gs-e-invoicing-feature-setup.md). For example, you can filter specific legal entities so that they're processed in applicability rules. By default, the feature is applicable to all legal entities that have a primary address in Australia or New Zealand.

1. The copy of the feature is always created as a **Draft** version. Regardless of whether you made changes, complete and deploy the feature as described in [Complete and deploy a Globalization feature](../global/gs-e-invoicing-complete-publish-deploy-globalization-feature.md).

## Finance configuration

You must configure some additional parameters directly in Finance.

1. Make sure that the country/region-specific Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the document context and electronic document model mapping that are required for Australia and New Zealand are imported. For more information, see [Set up Electronic invoicing parameters](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-parameters.md#set-up-electronic-document-parameters).

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you import the **Electronic invoicing for Australia and New Zealand** Electronic invoicing feature, electronic documents are configured by default. Follow the remaining steps of this procedure if you must make changes.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
1. On the **Electronic document** tab, add records for the **Customer Invoice journal** and **Project invoice** table names.
1. For each table name, set the **Document context** and **Electronic document model mapping** fields in accordance with step 1.

    ![Screenshot of the setup on the Electronic document tab of the Electronic document parameters page.](../media/apac_aus_nzl_einvoice_parameters.jpg)

1. Save your changes, and close the page.
