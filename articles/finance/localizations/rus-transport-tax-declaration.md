# Transport tax declaration (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to the tax code of the Russian Federation, vehicles are subject to
transport tax.

The tax period for transport tax is one year. At the end of the tax period, a
company must report a transport tax declaration.

The transport tax declaration should be submitted to the tax authority where the
vehicle is located. In this case, code **260** should be entered for the **at
place of** attribute. However, the greatest taxpayers can submit declarations to
the tax authority where the organization is registered as a greatest taxpayer.
In this case, code **216** should be entered for the **at place of** attribute.

The tax base for the calculation of transport tax is one of the following
criteria:

-   Engine power, measured in horsepower

-   Jet thrust, measured in kilograms of the power

-   Gross tonnage, measured in vessel tons

The transport tax calculation includes all fixed assets of the **Vehicle** asset
type for which the fixed asset record contains a transport tax code. If the
fixed asset is written off or sold during the accounting period, the tax
calculation uses data for the month when legal registration and removal from the
register occurred.

    the power interval. Then, in the **Value** field, specify the tax rate for
    the specified interval.

7.  In some cases, the transport tax rate also depends on the actual useful life
    of the vehicle. To define the tax rate so that it's based on the vehicle's
    lifetime, on the Action Pane, on the **Transport tax** tab, in the
    **Transport tax** group, select **By lifetime**. In the **Minimum limit**
    and **Maximum limit** fields, enter the lower and upper limits for the

| **Field**                                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Privilege**                                      | Enter the tax allowance code.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Type of tax**                                    | Select **Transport tax**.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Benefit type**                                   | Select the type of tax allowance. The following values are applicable to transport tax allowances: **Exemption from tax**, **Reduction of tax rate**, **Reduction of tax amount**, and **Tax deduction**. |
| **Name**                                           | Enter the name of the tax allowance.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Allowance value**                                | Define the tax allowance value, depending on type of tax allowance that you selected in the **Benefit type** field:                                                                                       |

-   **Exemption from tax:** Don't define the allowance value, because exemption
    from tax is always considered 100 percent, and the tax amount is 0 (zero).

-   **Reduction of tax rate:** Define the percentage of the tax rate reduction.
    For example, if the tax rate is 10 percent, and the allowance value is 2
    percent, the reduced tax rate is 8 percent.

-   **Reduction of tax amount:** Define the amount, in the local currency, that
    is reducing the calculated tax amount for each asset.

### Assign tax allowances to a sales tax code as a reduction of the tax rate and a reduction of the tax amount

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Tax reporting \> Sales tax
    relations**.

2.  Select the record for the sales tax code.

3.  In the **Allowance by reduction of rate** and **Allowance by reduction of
    tax** fields, select the appropriate tax allowances, if they are applicable
    to the sales tax code.

### Set up transport tax increasing factor groups and values

The amount of transport tax should be increased for expensive vehicle models
that are defined by the Ministry of Production and Trade in an informational
letter and annually reviewed. The coefficient that must be considered depends on
both the number of years that have passed since the vehicle's year of
manufacture and the cost of vehicle. For example, for a vehicle that costs
between 3 million and 5 million rubles, if less than one year has passed since
its year of manufacture, the increasing coefficient is 1.5.

1.  Go to **Fixed asset (Russia) \> Setup \> Tax reporting \> Transport tax
    increasing factor groups**.

2.  Create a group.

3.  On the **Transport tax increasing factor values** FastTab, define the
    following increasing factor values.

| **Field**      | **Description**                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| From date      | Enter the date when the factor value starts to apply.                                    |
| Upper lifetime | Enter the upper limit of the lifetime from manufacture that the factor value applies to. |
| Factor         | Enter the increasing factor.                                                             |

### Set up the territory code (OKTMO code) for the legal entity

1.  Go to **Organization administration \> Organizations \> Legal entities**.

>   it:

1.  On the **Registration types** page (**Organization administration \> Global
    address book \> Registration types \> Registration types**), create a
    registration type.

2.  On the **Registration categories** page (**Organization administration \>
    Global address book \> Registration types \> Registration categories**),
    assign the new registration type to the **RCOAD** registration category.

3.  In the **Registration number** field, enter the OKTMO code for the legal
    entity's location.

### Set up tax authorities and related OKTMO codes

You must create the tax authorities that you're required to report assessed tax
declarations to.

1.  Go to **Tax \> Indirect taxes \> Sales tax \> Sales tax authorities**.

2.  Create a tax authority.

3.  Set the **Authority** and **Name** fields.

4.  In the **STI code** field, enter the four-digit code for the tax authority.

5.  In the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account party that is
    associated with the tax authority.

6.  Define the main OKTMO code for the tax authority on the vendor account:

    1.  In the record for the vendor account, on the **Addresses** FastTab,
        select **More options \> Advanced**.

    2.  On the **Registration ID** FastTab, add a line.

    3.  In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type for
        OKATO/OKTMO.

    4.  In the **Registration number** field, enter the OKTMO code.

        **Note:** For realty objects that are located at the organization's main
        location, the tax authority that assessed tax is reported to is defined
        as the tax authority that has the same OKTMO code as the legal entity.

### Optional: Set up company divisions, their registration reason codes (KPP), and their OKTMO codes

If the organization has realty objects that are located in territories that
differ from the organization's main location, or if the organization has
separate subdivisions, you should set up company divisions.

1.  Go to **Organization administration \> Setup \> Separate divisions**.

2.  Create a company division.

    account. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type
    that is associated with the **KPP** registration category.

### Set up the organization's locations and assign them to company divisions

If the organization has realty objects that are located in territories that
differ from the organization's main location, or if the organization has
separate subdivisions, you should set up organization locations and assign them
to company divisions.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Location**.

2.  Select an existing location, or create a new location.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Separate division ID** field, select
    the company division that you created in the previous procedure.

    **Note:** For vehicles that are registered in territories that differ from
    the organization's main location, the tax authority that transport tax is
    reported to is defined as the tax authority that has the same OKTMO code as
    the separate division that is associated with the vehicle location. For
    information about how to associate a fixed asset with a location, see the
    [Specify the location of the vehicle](#specify-the-location-of-the-vehicle)
    section later in this topic.

    created for each sales tax code.

-   **Total** – A ledger journal for transport tax transactions will be created
    as one line that has the default sales tax code.

1.  Close the page.

### Set up the journal for posting transport tax

If transport tax transactions will be automatically created based on calculated
tax registers, you should set up a journal.

1.  Go to **General ledger \> Journal setup \> Journal names**.

2.  Create a line.

3.  Set the **Name** and **Voucher series** fields.

4.  In the **Journal type** field, select **Transport tax**.

### Set up a posting group for transport tax postings

If transport tax transactions will be automatically created based on calculated
tax registers, you should set up posting groups.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Tax reporting \> Group of posting
    of taxes**.

2.  Create a line.

3.  In the **Ledger posting group** field, select a ledger posting group for
    transport tax.

>   If no ledger posting group is listed, create one. In the **Sales tax
>   payable** field, enter the ledger account code for posting transport tax.

1.  In the **Account for FA taxes** field, select a ledger account for the
    transport tax expenses.

2.  Make sure that the **Sales tax payable** field is set to the ledger account
    code that you entered for the ledger posting group in step 3.

Create a vehicle and set up parameters for transport tax calculation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an overview of the steps for creating a vehicle and setting up
parameters for transport tax calculation:

1.  [Create a vehicle fixed asset and define parameters for transport tax
    calculation](#create-a-vehicle-fixed-asset-and-define-parameters-for-transport-tax-calculation)

2.  [Specify the location of the vehicle](#specify-the-location-of-the-vehicle)

3.  [Specify a tax allowance as an exemption from
    tax](#specify-a-tax-allowance-as-an-exemption-from-tax)

### Create a vehicle fixed asset and define parameters for transport tax calculation

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select an existing fixed asset, or create a new fixed asset.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Vehicle**.

    under operational management, leased, or owned by someone who is outside
    Russia.

5.  On the **Technical information** FastTab, in the **Vehicle** section, set
    the **Vehicle type**, **Model**, **Registration number**, and **Emission
    class** fields.

>   **Note:** You create vehicle types on the **Vehicle types** page (**Fixed
>   assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Vehicle \> Vehicle types**). You create vehicle
>   models on the **Vehicle models** page (**Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \>
>   Vehicle \> Vehicle models**).

1.  In the **Useful life** section, in the **Output year** field, specify the
    year of manufacture.

2.  In the **Government registration** section, set the **Date of the
    registration** and **Removal from the register date** fields.

3.  On the **Tax reporting** FastTab, in the **Transport tax** section, in the
    field **Tax base** field, specify the vehicle power. In the **Unit** field,
    specify the unit of measure for the vehicle power.

4.  If you partially own the fixed asset, in the **Owned share numerator** and
    **Owned share denominator** fields, define your ownership share as a simple
    fraction.

5.  In the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code for the assessed
    tax calculation.

6.  Set the **Increasing factor group** field.

7.  In the **Deduction** field, specify the tax deduction code. In the **Tax
    deduction amount** field, specify the deduction amount.

### Specify the location of the vehicle

By default, the assumption is that vehicles are located at the organization's
location and reported to the tax authority in the legal entity's territory. (The
OKTMO code of the tax authority matches the OKTMO code of the legal entity, and
realty objects are reported under the same OKTMO code.)

If the organization has vehicles that are located in different territories and
registered in different tax authorities, you must specify the location of the
vehicle.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the line for the vehicle.

    select **Transfer**.

4.  Create a line.

5.  Set the **Date** and **New location** fields.

### Specify a tax allowance as an exemption from tax 

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the line for the vehicle.

3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **History** group,
    select **Tax reporting data**.

4.  Create a line.

    exemption from tax applies. In the **Exemption from tax** field, select the
    code for the tax allowance as an exemption from tax.

Calculate transport tax registers
---------------------------------

After you've finished the setup, registered the acquisition of the vehicle, and
set up all vehicle parameters for transport tax calculation, you must calculate
transport tax registers. The following tax registers are available:

-   **Vehicle - tax calculation** – This tax register calculates transport tax
    for each vehicle. It shows the following information:

    -   The vehicle type, serial number, model, and registration number.

    -   The dates of vehicle registration and removal from the register.

    -   The tax base and the units of measure for the tax base.

    -   The useful lifetime, in years, after the year of manufacture, and the
        output year.

    -   The owned share as an indication that the vehicle is partially owned.

    -   **Factor Kp** – The increasing factor for expensive vehicles.

    -   The ownership factor if the vehicle was acquired or sold during the
        period. This factor is the ratio of the ownership period to the number
        of calendar months in the period.

    -   **Calculated advance payment / Tax** – If the tax register is calculated
        for the first quarter, second quarter, or third quarter, the tax advance
        amount before tax allowances are applied. If the tax register is
        calculated for the year, the transport tax amount before tax allowances
        are applied.

    -   **Exemption from tax** – The code for the tax allowance as an exemption
        from tax.

    -   The amount of the tax allowance as an exemption from tax.

    -   **Grace period** – The number of months when there is no tax exemption
        allowance.

    -   **Allowance factor** – The ratio of the grace period to the number of
        calendar months in the tax period.

    -   **Privilege** – The code for the tax allowance as a reduction of the
        rate or a reduction of tax.

    -   **Tax allowance amount** – The amount of the tax allowance as a
        reduction of the tax rate or a reduction of the tax amount.

    -   **Deduction** – The code for the tax deduction.

    -   **Tax allowance amount** – The amount of the tax deduction.

    -   The transport tax rate, budget revenue code, separate division ID, and
        location of the vehicle, and the tax authority that the tax for the
        vehicle will be reported to.

-   **Transport tax** – This tax register calculates total transport tax amounts
    for each sales tax code and OKTMO code.

>   To calculate and approve transport tax registers, follow these steps.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Journals \> Tax register journal**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  In the **Type of tax** field, either select **Transport tax** to create a

    tax).

4.  In the **Period types** field, select one of the following values:

    -   **Quarter** – Generate a journal for the calculation of transport tax
        advance payments.

    -   **Years** – Generate a journal for the annual transport tax calculation.

5.  In the **Period number** field, if you selected **Quarter** in the **Period
    types** field, enter the number of the quarter. If you selected **Years**,
    enter **1**.

6.  In the **Years** fields, enter the reporting year in *YYYY* format.

7.  Select **OK** to create the journal.

8.  Select **Lines** to create lines in the periodic register journal.

9.  You receive a message that states, "Register journal has not been created

2.  Select the approved journal for the period that must be corrected.

3.  Select **Correction \> Corrections to current journal**.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  In the **Type of tax** field, either select **Transport tax** if you must
    correct only transport tax registers, or leave the field blank if you must
    correct all the asset's tax registers.

6.  Make sure that the **Period types**, **Period number**, and **Years** fields
    are set to values that are appropriate for the period of the register that
    you're correcting.

7.  Select **OK**.

8.  Create tax register lines, and calculate and approve the tax registers as
    described in the previous procedure.
