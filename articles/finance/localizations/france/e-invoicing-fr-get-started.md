[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Learn more about how to get started with Electronic invoicing for France. This article guides you through the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in the Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) and in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. These steps complement the steps that are described in [Get started with the Electronic invoicing](../e-invoicing-get-started.md).

## Country/region-specific configuration for the French Chorus Pro submission (FR) Electronic invoicing feature

Some steps are required to configure the **French Chorus Pro submission (FR)** Electronic invoicing feature. Some of the parameters from the configuration are published with default values. These values must be reviewed and updated so that they better reflect your business operations.

### Prerequisites

## Finance configuration

### Prerequisites

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in France.
- The following Feature management key must be enabled: **(France) Electronic invoicing integration with Chorus Pro**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to be able to track the status of submitted documents in Chorus Pro, you must enable two features in the **Feature management** workspace: **Extended document identification in submission log** and **Execute update actions for submitted documents**.

### Configure legal entity data

#### Enter a legal entity's address

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**.
2. Select a legal entity, and then, on the **Addresses** FastTab, add a valid French primary address for the legal entity. Make sure that the following mandatory address elements are defined:

    - Country/region code
    - ZIP/postal code
    - City
    - Building number

#### Enter a legal entity and a customer Siret number

Use the information in [NAF codes and siret numbers](emea-fra-naf-codes-siret-numbers.md) and [Set up NAF codes and Siret numbers](fr-00003-naf-codes-siret-numbers.md) to set up NAF codes and Siret numbers. Alternatively, you can use [registration IDs](../europe/emea-registration-ids.md) to set up Siret numbers.

### Set up the project manager account

When you submit work invoices, you can use the **Project manager** party. Before you use it, the new party type must be set up as a customer account. It can then be used when invoices are posted.

Follow these steps to enable the project manager for a project invoice.

1. Go to **Project management and accounting** \> **Projects** \> **Project contracts**.
2. On the **Funding sources** tab, in the **Project manager** field, select a customer account. Then select **Project contracts** \> **Project contracts** \> **Project contracts**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Project manager** field is available only when the funding type is **Customer**.

### Define electronic invoice frameworks

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic invoice frameworks**.
2. In the **Type** field, enter the electronic invoicing framework.

If no electronic invoice framework is configured, all invoices are sent as **A1 - simple invoice**. Use the following codes for the invoice framework to attribute work invoices: A4 , A7, A8, A9, A10, A12, A13, A14, and A22. For more information, see [Invoicing framework and transmission modes](https://communaute.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/documentation/submit-works-invoices-for-suppliers-contracting-party-subcontracting-co-contracting/?lang=en#1530527446538-8a6bf25f-3ff8).

### Set up Chorus Pro electronic document parameters

You can enable Siret numbers and service code validation before you post and invoice documents.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
2. On the **Chorus Pro** tab, add the following information:

    - Web service URL
    - Login service URL
    - Client ID
    - Client secret
    - Technical user name
    - Technical user password

    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend that you use Azure Key Vault storage to store the secrets. For more information, see [Set up the Azure Key Vault client](../global/setting-up-azure-key-vault-client.md).

3. Enable the **SIRET and service code validation** parameter.
4. In the **Report format** field, select the configurable business document to use when a submission report is printed.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new submission report instead of customizing a default report, use the **DocumentSubmitted** model name and the **SubmittedInvoice** mapping name for the integration point.

To obtain the latest processing details for the invoice from Chorus Pro in the submission log, you must configure the response types in Finance.

Follow these steps to complete the configuration.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
2. On the **Electronic document** tab, add records for the **Customer Invoice journal** and **Project invoice** tables.
3. For each table name, set the **Document context** and **Electronic document model mapping** fields as specified in [Electronic invoicing parameters](../global/e-invoicing-set-up-parameters.md#set-up-electronic-document-parameters).
4. In the **Customer Invoice journal** table name field, select **Response types**.
5. Create a new response type that has the same name that was defined for the related variable in the corresponding feature setups in RCS.

    1. In the **Submission status** field, select **Pending**.
    2. In the **Data entity name** field, select **Sales invoice Chorus Pro entity**.
    3. In the **Model mapping** field, select **Chorus Pro invoice response data**.

6. Create another new response type that has the same name that was defined for the related variable in the corresponding feature setups in RCS.

    1. In the **Submission status** field, select **Pending update actions execution**.
    2. In the **Data entity name** field, select **Sales invoice Chorus Pro entity**.
    3. In the **Model mapping** field, select **Chorus Pro invoice response data**.
