[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the year-end closing process and opening transactions for the Czech Republic and Hungary. This functionality allows user to set up the year-end closing process in the following ways:

-    Posting to different accounts for closing and opening of balance accounts.
-    Transfer of profit or loss year-end result into the newly opened year to a different account.

## Year-end closing setup
On the **Accounts for automatic transactions** page, you can specify the general ledger accounts to be used during the year-end closing process:

-   Year-end result – This account will be used for transferring the ending balances of profit and loss transactions.
-   Transfer of closing and opening transactions – This account will be used for transferring ending balances of balance sheet accounts.

## Opening transactions setup
Before you can post opening transactions to a different account for each of main accounts, you must specify the ledger account in the **Opening account** field on the main account.
