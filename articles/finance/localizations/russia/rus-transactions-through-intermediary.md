# Transactions through intermediary

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to work with intermediary deals that are made by an agent in Russia with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

In economic activities that involve an intermediary, there are three participants:

- The person who sells or purchases goods (works or services)
- The third-party supplier or buyer
- The intermediary between the first two participants

Russian legislation defines three legal forms of intermediation:

- A commission agreement, where the committer (also known as the principal) engages a commissioner
- An agency agreement, where the principal engages an agent
- An assignment agreement, where the principal retains an attorney

The term *principal* refers to the party that engages the agent. The intermediary (the commissioner, agent, or attorney) performs legal actions and other actions (transactions) on behalf of the principal. Intermediaries can perform these actions in one of two ways:

- In their own name but at the principal's expense
- In the principal's name and at the principal's expense

The current implementation of this functionality has the following limitations:

- Credit notes can be registered only in the module where the original factures were registered.
- Sub-commission isn't supported.
- No commission bonus is calculated.
- No transactions are created in the general ledger, based on the report for the principal.
