# Transport tax declaration (Russia)

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to work with the Transport tax declaration for Russia in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

According to the tax code of the Russian Federation, vehicles are subject to transport tax.

The tax period for transport tax is one year. At the end of the tax period, a company must report a transport tax declaration.

The transport tax declaration should be submitted to the tax authority where the vehicle is located. In this case, code **260** should be entered for the **at place of** attribute. However, the greatest taxpayers can submit declarations to the tax authority where the organization is registered as a greatest taxpayer. In this case, code **216** should be entered for the **at place of** attribute.

The tax base for the calculation of transport tax is one of the following criteria:

-   Engine power, measured in horsepower
-   Jet thrust, measured in kilograms of the power
-   Gross tonnage, measured in vessel tons

The transport tax calculation includes all fixed assets of the **Vehicle** asset type for which the fixed asset record contains a transport tax code. If the fixed asset is written off or sold during the accounting period, the tax calculation uses data for the month when legal registration and removal from the register occurred.

> [!NOTE]
> - **Exemption from tax:** Don't define the allowance value, because exemption from tax is always considered 100 percent, and the tax amount is 0 (zero).
> - **Reduction of tax rate:** Define the percentage of the tax rate reduction. For example, if the tax rate is 10 percent, and the allowance value is 2 percent, the reduced tax rate is 8 percent.
> - **Reduction of tax amount:** Define the amount, in the local currency, that is reducing the calculated tax amount for each asset.

### Assign tax allowances to a sales tax code as a reduction of the tax rate and a reduction of the tax amount

To assign tax allowances to a sales tax code as a reduction of the tax rate and a reduction of the tax amount, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Tax reporting \> Sales tax relations**.
1. Select the record for the sales tax code.
1. In the **Allowance by reduction of rate** and **Allowance by reduction of tax** fields, select the appropriate tax allowances, if they are applicable to the sales tax code.

### Set up transport tax increasing factor groups and values

The amount of transport tax should be increased for expensive vehicle models that are defined by the Ministry of Production and Trade in an informational letter and annually reviewed. The coefficient that must be considered depends on both the number of years that have passed since the vehicle's year of manufacture and the cost of vehicle. For example, for a vehicle that costs between 3 million and 5 million rubles, if less than one year has passed since its year of manufacture, the increasing coefficient is 1.5.

To set up transport tax increasing factor groups and values, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed asset (Russia) \> Setup \> Tax reporting \> Transport tax increasing factor groups**.
1. Create a group.
1. On the **Transport tax increasing factor values** FastTab, define the following increasing factor values.

| **Field**      | **Description**                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| From date      | Enter the date when the factor value starts to apply.                                   |
| Upper lifetime | Enter the upper limit of the lifetime from manufacture that the factor value applies to. |
| Factor         | Enter the increasing factor.                                                            |

### Set up the territory code (OKTMO code) for the legal entity

    1. On the **Registration categories** page (**Organization administration \> Global address book \> Registration types \> Registration categories**), assign the new registration type to the **RCOAD** registration category.
    1. In the **Registration number** field, enter the OKTMO code for the legal entity's location.

### Set up tax authorities and related OKTMO codes

You must create the tax authorities that you're required to report assessed tax declarations to.

To set up tax authorities and related OKTMO codes, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Tax \> Indirect taxes \> Sales tax \> Sales tax authorities**.
1. Create a tax authority.
1. Set the **Authority** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **STI code** field, enter the four-digit code for the tax authority.
1. In the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account party that is associated with the tax authority.
1. Define the main OKTMO code for the tax authority on the vendor account:
    1. In the record for the vendor account, on the **Addresses** FastTab, select **More options \> Advanced**.
    1. On the **Registration ID** FastTab, add a line.
    1. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type for OKATO/OKTMO.
    1. In the **Registration number** field, enter the OKTMO code.

> [!NOTE]
> For realty objects that are located at the organization's main location, the tax authority that assessed tax is reported to is defined as the tax authority that has the same OKTMO code as the legal entity.

### Optional: Set up company divisions, their registration reason codes (KPP), and their OKTMO codes

If the organization has realty objects that are located in territories that differ from the organization's main location, or if the organization has separate subdivisions, you should set up company divisions.

To set up company divisions, their registration reason codes (KPP), and their OKTMO codes, follow these steps.

1. In the **Account for FA taxes** field, select a ledger account for the transport tax expenses.
1. Make sure that the **Sales tax payable** field is set to the ledger account code that you entered for the ledger posting group in step 3.

## Create a vehicle and set up parameters for transport tax calculation

Here is an overview of the steps for creating a vehicle and setting up parameters for transport tax calculation:

1. [Create a vehicle fixed asset and define parameters for transport tax calculation](#create-a-vehicle-fixed-asset-and-define-parameters-for-transport-tax-calculation)
1. [Specify the location of the vehicle](#specify-the-location-of-the-vehicle)
1. [Specify a tax allowance as an exemption from tax](#specify-a-tax-allowance-as-an-exemption-from-tax)

### Create a vehicle fixed asset and define parameters for transport tax calculation

To create a vehicle fixed asset and define parameters for transport tax calculation, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.
1. Select an existing fixed asset, or create a new fixed asset.
1. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Vehicle**.
1. In the **Flag of ownership** field, select whether the fixed asset is owned, under operational management, leased, or owned by someone who is outside Russia.
1. On the **Technical information** FastTab, in the **Vehicle** section, set the **Vehicle type**, **Model**, **Registration number**, and **Emission class** fields.

    >[!NOTE]
    > - You create vehicle types on the **Vehicle types** page (**Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Vehicle \> Vehicle types**).
    > - You create vehicle models on the **Vehicle models** page (**Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Vehicle \> Vehicle models**).

1. In the **Useful life** section, in the **Output year** field, specify the year of manufacture.

1. Set the **Increasing factor group** field.
1. In the **Deduction** field, specify the tax deduction code. In the **Tax deduction amount** field, specify the deduction amount.

### Specify the location of the vehicle

By default, the assumption is that vehicles are located at the organization's location and reported to the tax authority in the legal entity's territory. (The OKTMO code of the tax authority matches the OKTMO code of the legal entity, and realty objects are reported under the same OKTMO code.)

If the organization has vehicles that are located in different territories and registered in different tax authorities, you must specify the location of the vehicle.

To specify the location of the vehicle, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.
1. Select the line for the vehicle.
1. On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **History** group, select **Transfer**.
1. Create a line.
1. Set the **Date** and **New location** fields.

### Specify a tax allowance as an exemption from tax

To specify a tax allowance as an exemption from tax, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.
1. Select the line for the vehicle.
1. On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **History** group, select **Tax reporting data**.
1. Create a line.
1. In the **Period** field, specify the month when a tax allowance as an exemption from tax applies. In the **Exemption from tax** field, select the code for the tax allowance as an exemption from tax.

## Calculate transport tax registers

After you've finished the setup, registered the acquisition of the vehicle, and set up all vehicle parameters for transport tax calculation, you must calculate transport tax registers. The following tax registers are available:

- **Vehicle - tax calculation** – This tax register calculates transport tax for each vehicle. It shows the following information:

    - The vehicle type, serial number, model, and registration number.
    - The dates of vehicle registration and removal from the register.
    - The tax base and the units of measure for the tax base.
    - The useful lifetime, in years, after the year of manufacture, and the output year.
    - The owned share as an indication that the vehicle is partially owned.
    - **Factor Kp** – The increasing factor for expensive vehicles.
    - The ownership factor if the vehicle was acquired or sold during the period. This factor is the ratio of the ownership period to the number of calendar months in the period.
    - **Calculated advance payment / Tax** – If the tax register is calculated for the first quarter, second quarter, or third quarter, the tax advance amount before tax allowances are applied. If the tax register is calculated for the year, the transport tax amount before tax allowances are applied.
    - **Exemption from tax** – The code for the tax allowance as an exemption from tax.
    - The amount of the tax allowance as an exemption from tax.
    - **Grace period** – The number of months when there is no tax exemption allowance.
    - **Allowance factor** – The ratio of the grace period to the number of calendar months in the tax period.
    - **Privilege** – The code for the tax allowance as a reduction of the rate or a reduction of tax.
    - **Tax allowance amount** – The amount of the tax allowance as a reduction of the tax rate or a reduction of the tax amount.
    - **Deduction** – The code for the tax deduction.
    - **Tax allowance amount** – The amount of the tax deduction.
    - The transport tax rate, budget revenue code, separate division ID, and location of the vehicle, and the tax authority that the tax for the vehicle will be reported to.
- **Transport tax** – This tax register calculates total transport tax amounts for each sales tax code and OKTMO code.

To calculate and approve transport tax registers, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Journals \> Tax register journal**.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Type of tax** field, either select **Transport tax** to create a journal only for transport tax registers, or leave the field blank to create a journal for all the asset's taxes (assessed tax, land tax, and transport tax).
1. In the **Period types** field, select one of the following values:
    - **Quarter** – Generate a journal for the calculation of transport tax advance payments.
    - **Years** – Generate a journal for the annual transport tax calculation.
1. In the **Period number** field, if you selected **Quarter** in the **Period types** field, enter the number of the quarter. If you selected **Years**, enter **1**.
1. In the **Years** fields, enter the reporting year in *YYYY* format.
1. Select **OK** to create the journal.
1. Select **Lines** to create lines in the periodic register journal.
1. You receive a message that states, "Register journal has not been created yet. Do you want create it?" Select **Yes**.
1. Review the tax registers that are created. For transport tax, the following registers are created: **Vehicle – tax calculation** and **Transport tax**.
1. To calculate a specific tax register in the journal, select the register, and then select **Calculate current**. To calculate all tax registers in the journal, select **Calculate all**.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Select a tax register, and then select **Register lines** to review the calculated lines.
1. Select **Print** to print the tax register lines in Microsoft Excel.
1. Select **Reset status** to reset the status of the calculated register to **Not calculated**.
1. After you've finished reviewing the data in the tax registers, select the **Approved** checkbox to approve each register.
1. In the **Worker** field, view or change the code for the employee who approved the register.

### Create and calculate corrective tax registers

If you've corrected any vehicle data for the previous periods, you should create corrective tax registers to reflect the corrected transport tax amounts.

To create and calculate corrective registers, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Journals \> Tax register journal**.
1. Select the approved journal for the period that must be corrected.
1. Select **Correction \> Corrections to current journal**.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Type of tax** field, either select **Transport tax** if you must correct only transport tax registers, or leave the field blank if you must correct all the asset's tax registers.
1. Make sure that the **Period types**, **Period number**, and **Years** fields are set to values that are appropriate for the period of the register that you're correcting.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Create tax register lines, and calculate and approve the tax registers as described in the previous procedure.

### Generate a transport tax declaration

Before you can generate the transport tax declaration for a tax year, you must calculate the transport tax registers for the same year, and for the first quarter, second quarter, and third quarter of the same year.
