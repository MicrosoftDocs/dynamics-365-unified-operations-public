# Invoice factures processing and printing

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to work with invoice factures for Russia in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

An invoice-facture is a document that certifies the actual shipment of goods or services, and their cost. An invoice-facture is issued (sent) by the seller (contractor or performer) to the buyer (customer) after the buyer has accepted all the goods or services. An invoice-facture has two purposes. 

- Confirmation that the order or work has been completed
- Confirmation of the amount of value-added tax (VAT) that was paid, so that the amount can be credited later

An invoice-facture can be processed in the following ways:

- Based on a purchase order or sales order
- Based on a posted vendor or customer invoice
- Based on a purchase product receipt
- Based on a sales packing slip
- Based on a sales free-text invoice

## Setup

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.
