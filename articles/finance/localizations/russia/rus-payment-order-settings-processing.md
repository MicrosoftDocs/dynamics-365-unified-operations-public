### Create payment order lines

Before you can generate a payment order, you must create payment order lines.

To create payment order lines, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable \> Payments \> Payment journal**.
1. Create a journal, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Lines** to open the **Vendor payments** page.
1. Create a vendor payment line.
1. In the **Date** field, select the date of payment.
1. In the **Account** field, select the vendor account.
1. In the **Transaction text** field, enter text that describes the transaction.
1. In the **Debit** field, enter the sum of the payment.
1. In the **Currency** field, select the currency code.
1. In the **Offset account type** field, select the account type for the selected account.
1. In the **Offset account** field, select the offset account for the transaction.
1. In the **Currency** field, select the currency code.
1. In the **Method of payment** field, select the method of payment to use for the vendor.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're generating a payment order for a legal representative of the vendor, you must enter the vendor account in the **Payment documented on** field. In this case, the payment order slip will refer to the bank of the vendor that is specified in the **Payment documented on** field. However, the transaction will be performed for the vendor that is specified in the **Account** field.

1. On the **Payment order** tab, in the **Purpose text** field, enter any text that must be reflected on the payment order. If you select **VAT in payment order**, the text will be entered. This text includes the VAT amount in the **Purpose text** field.
1. Set the following fields: **Order of payment**, **Number status**, **Budget revenue code**, **Origin payment**, **Payment type**, **UCI**, and the fields in the **Period** section (**Period code**, **Period number**, **Year**, **Period date**). The values will be printed in the corresponding boxes on the payment order for the vendor or tax authority.

The payment status of the payment journal line for the voided payment order is changed to **None**, and the voided payment order is deleted from the registry of payment orders.
