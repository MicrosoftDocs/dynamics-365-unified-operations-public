[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up customs clearance registration information for products transported across the border of the Russian Federation in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

The customs clearance process includes the following tasks:

- Calculate customs payments. These payments include import and export customs fees, customs duties, value-added tax (VAT), and excise tax that is collected on products that are imported into the customs territory of the Russian Federation.
- Reflect the fact that the customs authorities have issued the cargo customs declaration (GTD) and the adjustment of the customs value (KTS).
- Generate postings for debts to customs or a customs broker, based on the amount of customs payments.
- Adjust the cost of imported products, based on the amount of customs duties and fees.
- Write off duties and fees for expenses.

## Set up the statistical value currency and number sequences

To set up the statistical value currency and number sequences, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Inventory and warehouse management parameters**.

       ![Settings on the General FastTab of the Sales tax codes page for a sales tax code of the Customs fee tax type.](../media/set-up-customs-clearance-04.png)

    â€“orâ€“

    If you selected **Customs duty** in the **Type of tax** field, follow these steps:

    1. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Complex rate** field, select the complex rate value that is applied to the customs duty:

        - If you leave this field blank, the complex rate value is an *ad valorem* duty and is calculated as a percentage of the customs value of the products. In this case, the distribution of the duty on the lines in the section of the customs journal is proportional to the value.
        - If you select **Maximum**, the rate is determined by comparing the calculated value of the customs duty (from the customs value) with the result of the formula *K* = (*r* &times; *m*) &divide; *q*, where *r* is the value of the **Amount rate** field, *m* is the quantity, weight, or volume in the customs journal, based on the **Method of duty calculation** field, and *q* is the value of the **Calculated quantity** field. The larger of the two values is used as the duty value. In this case, the distribution of the duty on the lines in the section of the customs journal is based on the value of the **Method of duty calculation** field.
        - If you select **Summation**, the calculated value of the customs duty (from the customs value) is added to the result of the formula *K* = (*r* &times; *m*) &divide; *q*, where *r* is the value of the **Amount rate** field, *m* is the quantity, weight, or volume in the customs journal, based on the **Method of duty calculation** field, and *q* is the value of the **Calculated quantity** field. In this case, the distribution of the duty on the lines in the section of the customs journal is proportional to the value.

    1. If you selected a value in the **Complex rate** field, set the following fields:

        - In the **Method of duty calculation** field, select the method that is used to calculate the customs duty.
        - In the **Unit** field, select the unit of measurement that the value of the **Amount rate** field is measured in.

To set up the terms of delivery for customs clearance of imported products, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Terms of delivery**.

    â€“orâ€“

    Go to **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Distribution** \> **Terms of delivery**.

    â€“orâ€“

    Go to **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Distribution** \> **Terms of delivery**.

1. Create and set up a set of terms of delivery.
1. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Receipt transactions status** field, select the status of the receipt transactions that are included in the customs journal of import:

    - **Purchased** â€“ The products in transit are purchased. The transfer of ownership occurs before the products cross the customs border.
    - **On order** â€“ The products in transit are ordered but not purchased. The transfer of ownership occurs after the products cross the customs border.

    ![Terms of delivery page.](../media/set-up-customs-clearance-06.png)

## Set up a charges code for customs payments

For imported purchases, if the transfer of ownership occurred after the customs clearance process, the amounts of customs duties and fees adjust the purchase amount. The invoice lines for duties and fees are automatically created when the customs journal or KTS journal is posted.

If the transfer of ownership occurred before the products crossed the customs border, the change in the cost of receipt is made by correcting the overhead expenses for the purchase order invoice when the customs journal or KTS journal is posted.

The cost adjustment is made if the **Include to the cost** option is set to **Yes** on the customs journal header or in the KTS journal. Otherwise, the amount of fees and duties will be charged as expenses to the account that is set up in the posting group of the corresponding tax code.

To set up a charges code for customs payments, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable** \> **Charges** **setup** \> **Charges code**.
1. Create and set up a charges code. For more information, see [Create charges codes](/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/create-charges-codes).
1. In the **Customs payment type** field, select the type of customs payment to establish compliance with the overhead expense.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Charges codes where the **Customs payment type** field is set aren't available for manual selection when you create a purchase order.

1. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Debit** section, in the **Type** field, select **Item**. Alternatively, in the **Credit** section, in the **Type** field, select **Ledger account**.
1. In the **Credit** section, set the following fields:

    - In the **Posting** field, select the appropriate posting type. For example, select **Purchase charges duty** for duty.
    - In the **Account** field, select the account that is used as a transit account if the transfer of ownership occurs after the customs clearance process. In this case, the invoice is posted in two iterations: it's posted to the transit account when the customs journal or KTS journal is posted, and it's posted to the nomenclature account when the purchase order invoice is posted.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

    ![Charges codes page.](../media/set-up-customs-clearance-07.png)

## Assign a charges code to terms of delivery

You must relate the terms of delivery to overhead expenses that increase the transaction amount (the cost of imported products).

To assign a charges code to terms of delivery, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Inventory management** > **Setup** > **Custom payments** > **Misc. charges relation with terms of delivery**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
1. In the **Charges code** field, select the charges code that is used when customs payments are calculated for the specified delivery condition. The amount of the overhead expense is automatically added to the invoice value when customs payments are calculated.
1. In the **Delivery terms** field, select a set of terms of delivery for the charges code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After the customs journal is processed, you can't distribute expenses to customs journal purchase lines or invoice overhead expense lines where the delivery condition corresponds to the delivery conditions on the customs journal header. This restriction exists because those overhead expenses affect the basis for calculating customs payments.

## Set up a product

To set up a product, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Product information management** \> **Products** \> **Released products**.
1. Create and set up a product if necessary.
