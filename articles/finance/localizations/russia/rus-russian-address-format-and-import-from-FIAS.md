# Russian address formats

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to work with Russian address formats and import data from the Russian Federation Information Address System (FIAS) with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

Address formats determine how address data will appear when it's printed. In the system, you can set up address formats for every country or region where business is done. In Russia, addresses have a standardized form. However, additional information can be included, such as the district, street code, building complement, building, apartment, group of houses, group of flats, and land plot.

The Federal Informational Address System (or FIAS) address database might be required for businesses in the Russian Federation. You can use specialized tools to import FIAS into your system and keep it up to date. This article explains how to set up and use the FIAS import mechanisms.

> [!NOTE]
> The Federal Tax Service (FTS) stopped updating files with address information in the FIAS format in August 2021. The new format was approved by an order of the FTS that was dated May 13, 2020: No. ED-7-6 / 329 @ FIAS (old format that contains information about addresses in the structure of the administrative-territorial division); State address register (GAR, a new format that contains information about addresses in the municipal division).

## FIAS import

### Do a full FIAS import to an empty database

Because the full FIAS database contains a very large number of records, some performance issues might occur during import. To help prevent these issues, the first time that you do an import, you should use the FIAS database file in TXT format. You can find this file in the LCS Shared asset library. It contains the FIAS database on December 1, 2018.

To do a full FIAS import to an empty database, follow these steps.

1. Go to [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Index), and in the Shared asset library, on the **Data package** tab, download the **RU FIAS - addrObjCSV** file. Verify that the file contains the AS_ADDROBJ_20181216_\<number of state\>.txt file and, optionally, House, Stead, and Room files.
1. Create a zip archive that contains the files from the downloaded package for one or more states.
1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Organization administration \> Global address book \> Import from FIAS**.
1. Select **Import FIAS** to open the **Import of data** dialog.
1. On the **Parameters** FastTab, select **Browse** to select the zip archive that you created earlier.
1. Set the **Full import** option to **Yes**.
1. If you intend to import houses and steads, set the **Does include houses** option to **Yes**.
1. If you intend to import rooms, set the **Does include rooms** option to **Yes**.

   ![Import data pane.](../media/15%20Import%20of%20data.jpg)

1. Select **OK** to start the import.
1. Select **Refresh** in the upper right of the page to view the line together with the results of the full import.
    
   ![Options tab.](../media/16%20Import%20from%20FIAS.jpg)

### Update addresses from FIAS

To update addresses from FIAS, follow these steps.

1. Download the database with the latest updated date from [The FIAS website](https://fias.nalog.ru/).
1. Select the downloaded database in ZIP format, and do the import just as you did in the previous section. However, in the **Import of data** dialog, set the **Full import** option to **No**.

### Tips for speeding up the import process

The time that is required to import FIAS data depends on the amount of data that is being imported and the system setup. Here are some tips that might help speed up the import process.

To potentially speed up the import process, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **System administration \> Workspaces \> Data management**.
1. In the **Import / Export** section, select the **Framework parameters** tile to open the **Data import/export framework parameters** page.
1. On the **Entity settings** tab, select **Configure entity execution parameters** to open the **Entity import execution parameters** page.
1. Set the following fields to configure multithreading for FIAS entities that are used in import jobs:
    - In the **Entity** field, select the FIAS entity.
    - In the **Import threshold record count** field, enter the threshold record count for import.
    - In the **Import task count** field, enter the count of import tasks.

   ![Entity import execution parameters.](../media/17%20Entity%20import%20execution%20parameters.jpg)

When you run a full import job, provide several regions, but not all regions, at the same time.
