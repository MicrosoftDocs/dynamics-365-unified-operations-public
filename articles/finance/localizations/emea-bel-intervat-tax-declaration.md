# INTERVAT tax declaration

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Overview

This topic provides country/region-specific information about how to set up and create the INTERVAT tax declaration for legal entities in Belgium.

You can create the INTERVAT tax declaration as an XML file. You can also preview the amounts of the value-added tax (VAT) declaration in a printable format.

The INTERVAT declaration that you create includes tax transactions from the current period. It can also include corrections from the previous period, if a transaction was posted in the previous period after that period was closed.

You can enter additional information for the declaration and manually correct data on the **Additional sales tax report boxes** page. Manual correction might be required if, for example, you can't print the amount of the reporting code in the INTERVAT declaration because the amount is negative. Negative amounts must be deducted from the next VAT declaration, and this task must be completed manually by using corrections. Before you can indicate the corrected amount, you must indicate which sales tax reporting codes allow for corrections.

## Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be set up before you begin to work with the INTERVAT tax declaration:

-   Legal entity
-   Registration number
-   Contact information
-   Number sequences
-   Posting journal
-   Sales tax authorities
-   Sales tax reporting codes
-   Sales tax codes
-   Tax exempt number

### Legal entity

1.  Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**, and select your legal entity.
2.  On the **Addresses** FastTab, create an address.
3.  In the **Country/region** field, select **Belgium**.
4.  Fill in other address components, and mark the address as **Primary**.
5.  On the **Tax registration** FastTab, in the **Tax registration number** field, specify the tax registration number for your company.

### Registration number

1.  Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**.
2.  Select **Registration IDs**, and then, on the **Registration ID** tab, select **Add**.
3.  In the **Registration type** field, select a value.
4.  In the **Registration number** field, enter a value.
5.  On the **General** tab, enter an effective date. For more information, see [Registration number](emea-registration-ids.md).

### Contact information

1.  Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**.
2.  On the **Contact information** tab, add lines for the phone number and email address, and set them to **Primary**.

### Number sequences

1.  Go to **General ledger** \> **Ledger setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
2.  On the **Number sequences** tab, set up number sequences for the **Annual sales list ID** and **INTERVAT ID** references.

### Posting journal

1.  Go to **General ledger** \> **Journal setup** \> **Posting journals**.
2.  On the **Journal setup** page, select **Create**. The voucher series is automatically created.

### Sales tax authorities

2.  Verify that the **Report layout** field is set to **Belgium report layout**.

### Sales tax reporting codes

-   Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax reporting codes**, and create new sales tax reporting codes.

If the **Sales tax correction** check box is selected for a sales tax reporting code, that code is available for selection on the **Additional sales tax report boxes** page.

Examples of sales tax reporting code are provided in the [Set up sales tax reporting codes](#set-up-sales-tax-reporting-codes) section later in this topic.

### Sales tax codes

1.  Go to **Tax** \> **Indirect taxes** \> **Sales tax codes**.
2.  Add or select information in the fields on the **Report** and **Report â€“ credit note** tabs.
3.  Select the required values in the **Sales tax reporting codes** grid.

### Tax exempt number

1.  Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Tax exempt numbers**.
2.  For each tax-exempt number, create a record that includes the followinginformation:

    -   In the **Country/region** field, select the tax registration of the counterparty.
    -   In the **Tax exempt number** field, enter the tax-exempt number of the counterparty.
    -   In the **Company name** field, enter the name of the counterparty.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't have to enter codes **71**, **72**, and **91**, because they will be generated automatically.

To set up an assignment of sales tax reporting codes to sales tax codes, go to **Sales tax codes \> Report setup/Report setup - Credit note**. Consider the following relations between sales tax reporting codes:

-   If there is an amount in code **01**, **02**, or **03**, there should also be an amount in code **54**.
-   If there is an amount in code **54**, there should also be an amount in code **01**, **02**, or **03**.
-   If there is an amount in code **86**, there should also be an amount in code **55**.
-   If there is an amount in code **87**, there should also be an amount in code **56** or **57**.
-   The difference between the amount in code **54** and the sum of codes **01**, **02**, and **03** multiplied by the corresponding VAT rates can't be more than 61.97 EUR.
-   The difference between the amount in code **55** and the sum of codes **84** and **86** multiplied by the corresponding VAT rates can't be more than 610.97 EUR.
-   The difference between the sum of the amounts in codes **56** and **57** and the sum of codes **85** and **87** multiplied by the corresponding VAT rates can't be more than 61.97 EUR.
-   The amount in code **59** should be more than the sum of codes **81**, **82**, **83**, **84**, and **85**.
-   The amount in code **63** and code **85** multiplied by the corresponding VAT rates can't be more than 61.97 EUR.
-   The amount in code **64** and code **49** multiplied by the corresponding VAT rates can't be more than 61.97 EUR.

## Additional sales tax report boxes

1.  Go to **Tax** \> **Declarations** \> **Sales tax** \> **Additional sales tax report boxes**.
2.  Select **New** to create lines that have additional information about reporting codes, including manual corrections of the INTERVAT tax declaration. Before you close a settlement period, you should create the line for it, either by posting the sales tax payment or by creating an INTERVAT declaration that is marked as **Update**. The following table describes the fields that you must set for a new line.

| **Field**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                           |

| From date         | Enter the first day of the sales tax settlement period to calculate sales tax for. This value corresponds to the date in the **From** field on the **Sales tax settlement periods** page. |
| To date           | Enter the last date of the sales tax settlement period.                                                                                                                                   |

|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Settlement period | Select the applicable reporting period.                                                                                                                                                   |
| From date         | Enter the first day of the sales tax settlement period to calculate sales tax for. This value corresponds to the date in the **From** field on the **Sales tax settlement periods** page. |
| To date           | Enter the last day of the sales tax settlement period.                                                                                                                                    |
| Reporting code    | Select the reporting code. Only the reporting codes that the **Tax corrections** check box is selected for will be available during tax correction entry.                                 |
| Amount            | Enter the correction amount.                                                                                                                                                              |

> [!NOTE]
> Composed reporting codes that are used for credit notes. such as code **8185**, aren't available for selection. Nor are codes **71**, **72**, and **91**. Codes **71** and **72** are calculated automatically when Belgian sales tax reporting is run. Code **91** is entered in another way (see description of **Disbursement** field above).
>
> If a tax period is updated, a voucher number and a date will be shown. (For more information, see the description of the **Update** check box in the [Generate an INTERVAT tax declaration](#generate-an-intervat-tax-declaration) section later in this topic.) The period that has a voucher number and a date is a closed VAT period for Belgium. Therefore, all values on the **General** tab of the **Tax corrections** page are read-only. When new transactions that have taxes are entered for the closed VAT period, the taxes will be forwarded to the next available open tax period.

|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Settlement period        | Select the applicable reporting period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| From date                | Enter the first day of the sales tax settlement period to calculate sales tax for. This value corresponds to the date in the **From** field on the **Sales tax settlement periods** page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Transaction date         | Enter the date when the sales tax report is calculated. The default value is the current date. The sales tax payment is calculated for all transactions that were posted during the settlement period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Update                   | A selected check box closes the period and creates a sales tax payment, if it wasn't already created. Therefore, all VAT transactions that are entered in this period after the update will be forwarded to the next available open period. A selected check box also creates the line on the **Additional sales tax report boxes** page, if it wasn't already created. None of the values on this new line can be edited. |
| Replaced VAT declaration | Enter the identification number of the declaration to replace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| File                     | Enter the file name that the INTERVAT tax declaration will be exported to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Format mapping           | Select the **INTERVAT format (BE)** ER format that you downloaded earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

You can also close the tax period by generating a sales tax payment (**Tax \> Declarations \> Sales tax \> Settle and post sales tax**).

4.  Select **OK**. The system generates the INTERVAT tax declaration line and an INTERVAT XML file.
5.  Review the information in the declaration.
