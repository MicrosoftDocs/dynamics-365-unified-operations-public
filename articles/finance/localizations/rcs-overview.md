# Regulatory Configuration Service

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) is a standalone designer and lifecycle management service for no-code/low-code globalization functionality. RCS lets globalization stakeholders extend and customize key globalization areas of tax, e-invoicing, regulatory reporting, banking, and business documents without having to involve developers. This no-code/low-code globalization approach makes globalization easier, faster, and more cost effective to create or extend.

RCS provides the following capabilities:

- Support for all functionality that is provided by Electronic reporting (ER).
- A prerequisite to configure new globalization microservices.
- Support for Electronic Invoicing. For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/electronic-invoicing-add-on-dynamics-365-ga).
- Supports for Tax Calculation. For more information, see [Tax service](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/tax-service-preview).
- Support for new globalization feature functionality that simplifies the lifecycle management of multi-component features and provides extra capability to configure actions and set up feature parameters. For more information, see [Regulatory Configuration Service â€“ simplified globalization feature management for globalization services](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/regulatory-configuration-service-simplified-globalization-feature-management-globalization-services).
- Support for centralized publication, storage, and sharing of custom configurations in the Global repository to simplify configuration management without requiring the use of Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).
