# VAT declaration (Czech Republic)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the value-added tax (VAT) declaration for the Czech Republic. It includes instructions for setting up and generating the VAT declaration and the VAT control statement.

## <a name="overview"></a>VAT declaration overview

### VAT declaration

This section describes the sections and rows of the VAT declaration, calculations, and the relations between the VAT declaration and the VAT control statement.

To automatically generate the VAT declaration and the VAT control statement, you must first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each box on the VAT declaration. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the VAT declaration format and the VAT control statement format, you must associate sales tax codes with the lookup result of the lookup for the VAT declaration boxes. For more information about how to set up application-specific parameters, see the [Set up parameters for declaration fields](#set-up-parameters-for-declaration-fields) section later in this article.

In the table in section 1, the "Lookup result" column shows the lookup result that is preconfigured for a specific VAT declaration row in the VAT declaration format and the VAT control statement format. Use this information to correctly associate sales tax codes with the lookup result and then with the row of the VAT declaration.

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure sales tax codes to post incoming reverse charge VAT by using use tax, you should associate your sales tax codes with the lookup result that contains "UseTax" in the name. For example, for intra-community purchases, configure the **EUPurchaseGoodsUseTaxStandard** lookup result for **Use tax** sales tax codes, or configure the **EUPurchaseGoodsVATPayableStandard** lookup result for sales tax codes that have a reverse charge. For more information about how to configure reverse charge VAT, see [Reverse charges](emea-reverse-charge.md).

The VAT declaration format in the Czech Republic contains the following sections:

- [Section 1: Taxable transactions](#taxabletransactions)
- [Section 2: Other supplies and supplies that originate outside of the Czech Republic with the right to deduct](#othersupplies)
- [Section 3: Additional data](#additionaldata)
- [Section 4: VAT deduction](#vatreduction)
- [Section 5: Reduction of the right to deduct](#righttodeduct)
- [Section 6: Tax calculation](#taxcalculation)

## VAT control statement

The following sections provide an overview of the sections in the VAT control statement.

### <a name="sectiona1"></a>Section A1: Sale of goods and services under domestic reverse charges

Section A1 shows the documents that generate the amount in row 25 of the VAT declaration. It contains the following information about each document.

| Field                                          | XML element   |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Tax document number                            | c\_evid\_dd   |
| VAT number of the customer (numeric part only) | ic\_odb       |
| <p>Date</p><p>(This field specifies the date of the VAT register.)</p> | duzp          |
| Subject code                                   | kod\_pred\_pl |
| Tax base                                       | zakl\_dane1   |

To automatically determine the subject code for the document, set up enough reverse charge item groups, and associate them with items (products), items groups, or procurement categories. For more information, see the [Set up reverse charge item groups](#set-up-reverse-charge-item-groups) section later in this article. For more information about how to configure reverse charges, see [Reverse charge VAT](emea-reverse-charge.md). If you will post incoming reverse charges in the vendor invoice journals that aren't associated with products, you should have enough item sales tax groups to differentiate the subject codes of the reverse charges.

You must also associate the pairs of reverse charge item groups and tax codes with the result of the **\$SubjectCodeLookup** lookup in the application-specific parameters of the **VAT control statement (CZ)** format. For more information about how to set up application-specific parameters, see the [Set up parameters for subject codes](#set-up-parameters-for-subject-codes) section later in this article.

The following subject codes are available in the **VAT control statement XML (CZ)** format.

| Code                     | Description                                                                   |

Information about VAT amount adjustments for customer bad debts is also shown in row 33 of the VAT declaration.

To automatically determine the amount of VAT adjustment for bad debts, create a special tax code, and use it to post the write-off of the customer bad debts. For more information, see the [Write off customer bad debts by using the Write off function](#write-off-customer-bad-debts-by-using-the-write-off-function) section later in this article. Also associate this sales tax code with the **VATAdjustmentCustomerBadDebtsStandard**, **VATAdjustmentCustomerBadDebtsReduced**, and **VATAdjustmentCustomerBadDebtsReduced2** lookup results of **\$ReportFieldLookup** in the application-specific parameters of the VAT declaration format and the VAT control statement format.

## Set up the VAT declaration

To begin to work with the VAT declaration, you should download electronic reporting formats. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2), in the Shared asset library, download the latest versions of the following Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the VAT declaration format:

- **Tax declaration model**
- **Tax declaration model mapping**
- **VAT declaration XML (CZ)** – This configuration is in XML format DPHDP3.
- **VAT declaration Excel (CZ)** – This configuration can be used to preview VAT declaration amounts in Microsoft Excel. Be aware that the Excel template is in English only. If the report must be printed in another language, you must do a small customization to translate the Excel template into another language, and you must attach this customization to your derived configuration.
- **VAT control statement (CZ)** – This configuration is in XML format DPHKH1.

For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

## Set up application-specific parameters for formats

### Set up parameters for declaration fields

To automatically generate a VAT declaration, you should associate sales tax codes in the application and report fields in the ER configuration.

1. Go to **Workspaces \> Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT declaration XML (CZ)** configuration, and then select **Configurations \> Application specific parameters setup**.
3. On the **Lookups** FastTab, select the **\$ReportFieldLookup** lookup.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, associate the sales tax codes and report fields.

    | Column          | Description |
    |-----------------|-------------|
    | Lookup result   | Select the report field for setup. For more information about the report fields and their assignment to VAT declaration rows, see the [VAT declaration overview](#overview) section earlier in this article. |
    | Tax code (Code) | <p>Select the sales tax code to associate with the report field. Posted tax transactions that use the selected sales tax code will be collected in the appropriate report field.</p><p>We recommend that you separate sales tax codes in such a way that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one report field.</p> |
    | Name            | <p>If you didn't create enough sales tax codes so that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one report field, you can set up a transaction classifier. The following transaction classifiers are available:</p><ul><li>**Purchase**</li><li>**PurchaseExempt** (tax-exempt purchase)</li><li>**PurchaseReverseCharge** (tax receivable from a purchase reverse charge)</li><li>**Sales**</li><li>**SalesExempt** (tax-exempt sale)</li><li>**SalesReverseCharge** (tax payable from a purchase reverse charge or a sales reverse charge)</li><li>**Use tax**</li></ul>For each transaction classifier, a classifier for the credit note is also available. For example, one of these classifiers is **PurchaseCreditNote** (purchase credit note). |

5. To prevent the format from throwing an exception error message because of missed setup when you run the report, create the following line as the last line in the parameters.

    | Lookup result | Tax code (Code) | Name          |
    |---------------|-----------------|---------------|
    | Other         | \*Not blank\*   | \*Not blank\* |

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This line must be the last line in the parameters.
    >
    > If you create this line, make sure that you set up parameters for all sales tax codes in the system. Then, if any sales tax codes are missing in the setup, tax transactions that use those codes won't be collected for VAT declaration. If you don't create this line, and any tax transactions use sales tax codes that aren't configured in the application-specific parameters, you will receive an error message when you run the report.

6. In the **State** field, select **Completed**, and review the parameters.

    [![Conditions FastTab on the Application specific parameters page.](media/Pic1_ReportFieldLookup.png)](media/Pic1_ReportFieldLookup.png)

7. On the Action Pane, select **Export** to export the parameters to an XML file.
8. Select the **VAT declaration Excel (CZ**) configuration, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Import** to import the parameters that you configured for **VAT declaration XML (CZ)**. 
9. In the **State** field, select **Completed**.
10. Select the **VAT control statement XML (CZ)** configuration, and then select the same values that you selected in step 4.
11. In the **State** field, select **Completed**.

### Set up parameters for subject codes 

To automatically classify a transaction by using the subject code of a reverse charge in sections A1 and B1 of the VAT control statement, associate pairs of reverse charge item groups and item sales tax groups in the application, and then supply the codes to the ER configuration.

1. Go to **Workspaces \> Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT control statement XML (CZ)** configuration, and then select **Configurations \> Application specific parameters setup**.
3. On the **Lookups** FastTab, select **\$SubjectCodeLookup**.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, associate reverse charge item groups and subject codes.

    | Column                              | Description |
    |-------------------------------------|-------------|
    | Lookup result                       | Select the subject code. For the full list of subject codes, see the [Section A1: Sale of goods and services under domestic reverse charge](#sectiona1) section earlier in this article. |
    | Reverse charge code (Code)          | Select the reverse charge item group to associate with the selected subject code. For some transactions, if you post incoming reverse charge transactions that don't have a reference to the product, you must associate the item sales tax group with the subject code. In this case, select **\*Blank\*** in this field. To prevent an exception error from being generated when transactions don't have a reverse charge, the application-specific parameters must always include one line where the **Lookup result** field is set to **Other** and the **Reverse charge code (Code)** field is set to **\*Blank\***. This line must be the last line in the setup. |
    | Item sales tax group (TaxItemGroup) | Select the item sales tax group to associate with the selected subject code. You must select a specific item sales tax group if you don't have an appropriate reverse charge item group that will be used when you post incoming reverse charge transactions that don't have a reference to the product (for example, transactions from the vendor invoice journal). Otherwise, for all lines, you can select **\*Not blank\*** in this column. |

5. To prevent the format from failing and throwing an exception error message because of missed setup, set up the following line as the last line.

    | Lookup result | Reverse charge code (Code) | Item sales tax group (TaxItemGroup) | Comment |
    |---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|
    | Other         | \*Blank\*                  | \*Not blank\*                       | This line must be set up to prevent an error message from being generated for transactions that don't have a reverse charge code. |

[![Lookup for the subject code.](media/Pic2_SubjectCodeLookup.png)](media/Pic2_SubjectCodeLookup.png)

### Set up parameters for fulfillment mode codes

To automatically classify a transaction by using the fulfillment mode code in section A4 of the VAT control statement, associate sales tax codes in the application and fulfillment subjects mode codes in the ER configuration.

1. Go to **Workspaces \> Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT control statement XML (CZ)** configuration, and then select **Configurations \> Application specific parameters setup**.
3. On the **Lookups** FastTab, select **\$FulfillmentModeCodeLookup**.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, associate the sales tax codes and fulfillment subjects mode codes.

    | Column          | Description |
    |-----------------|-------------|
    | Lookup result   | Select a fulfillment code. For the full list of codes, see the [Section A4: Taxable sales with amounts above 10,000 including VAT and all VAT adjustments made for customer bad debts](#sectionA4) section earlier in this article. |
    | Tax code (Code) | Select the sales tax code. |

5. If you have transactions that use only normal filling, you can create the following line in the setup. Otherwise, set up the same line that you set up as the last line of the preceding setup, to prevent the format from failing and throwing an exception error message because of missed setup.

    | Lookup result | Tax code (Code) |
    |---------------|-----------------|
    | NormalFilling | \*Not blank\*   |

### Set up parameters for no obligation to issue a tax document

A sales transaction can automatically be classified as fulfilling the condition that there was no obligation to issue a tax document, so that the transaction should be shown in section A5, regardless of the threshold. To automatically classify a sales transaction in this way, associate pairs of sales tax groups and sales tax codes from the application with **Yes** or **No** conditions in the ER configuration.

1. Go to **Workspaces \> Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT control statement XML (CZ)** configuration, and then select **Configurations \> Application specific parameters setup**.
3. On the **Lookups** FastTab, select **\$NoTaxDocument**.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, associate sales tax groups and sales tax codes.

    | Column          | Description |
    |-----------------|-------------|
    | Lookup result   | Select **Yes** if there is no obligation to issue a tax document. This situation typically occurs because the customer isn't registered for VAT purposes. |
    | Sales tax group | Select the sales tax group to associate with the customer if there is no obligation to issue tax document. If you can determine the condition by using only a sales tax code, select **\*Not blank\***. |
    | Tax code (Code) | Select the sales tax code to assign to the transaction if there is no obligation to issue a tax document. If you can determine conditions by using only a sales tax group, select **\*Not blank\***. |

5. To prevent the format from failing and throwing an exception because of missed setup, create the following line as the last line in the setup.

    | Lookup result | Sales tax group (TaxGroup) | Tax code (Code) |
    |---------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
    | No            | \*Not blank\*              | \*Not blank\*   |

6. Review the parameters.

    [![Lookup for the condition that there is no obligation to issue a tax document.](media/Pic3_NoTaxDocumentLookup.png)](media/Pic3_NoTaxDocumentLookup.png)

7. Update the **State** field for all the parameters to **Completed**.
