# Get started with Electronic invoicing for Saudi Arabia - Phase one

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information that will help you get started with phase one of Electronic invoicing for Saudi Arabia in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. This article guides you through the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS). These steps complement the steps that are described in [Get started with Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-get-started.md).

### Prerequisites

Before you complete the steps in this article, the following prerequisites must be met: 

- Import the **Saudi Arabian electronic invoice (SA)** Electronic invoicing feature into RCS from the Global repository. For more information, see [Import an Electronic invoicing feature from the Microsoft configuration provider](e-invoicing-get-started.md#import-an-electronic-invoicing-feature-from-the-microsoft-configuration-provider).
- In Dataverse, configure virtual entities for Finance and Supply Chain Management. For more information, see [Configure Dataverse virtual entities](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/admin-reference.md).
- Enable the **CustomerPaymentMethodEntity** virtual entity. For more information, see [Enable Microsoft Dataverse virtual entities](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/enable-virtual-entities.md).
- Add the Dataverse endpoint as a connected application in the RCS instance. For more information, see [Create a connected application](e-invoicing-get-started-service-administration.md#create-a-connected-application).
- Taxpayers and their software for e-invoicing must be onboarded by Saudi Arabian tax authorities. For more information about the onboarding process, see [Electronic invoicing onboarding in Saudi Arabia](e-invoicing-sa-onboarding.md).

## Country-specific configuration for the Saudi Arabian electronic invoice (SA) Electronic invoicing feature
