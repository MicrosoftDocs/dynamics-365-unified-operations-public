# VAT declaration (Spain)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to set up and generate a value-added tax (VAT) declaration model 303 for Spain in the official TXT format. It also describes how to preview the VAT declaration in Microsoft Excel.

To automatically generate the report, first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each box on the advance VAT declaration. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the Electronic reporting (ER) format for the advance VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes with the lookup result of the lookups for the boxes on the VAT declaration.

For Spain, you must configure **Report field lookup**. For more information about how to set up application-specific parameters, see the [Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields](#set-up) section later in this article.

In the following table, the "Lookup result" column shows the lookup result that is preconfigured for a specific VAT declaration row in the VAT declaration format. Use this information to correctly associate sales tax codes with the lookup result and then with the row of the VAT declaration.

#### Purchase reverse charge VAT

If you configure sales tax codes to post incoming reverse charge VAT by using use tax, associate your sales tax codes with the lookup result of **Report field lookup** that contains "UseTax" in the name.

Alternatively, you can configure two separate sales tax codes: one for VAT due and one for VAT deduction. Then associate each code with the corresponding lookup results of **Report field lookup**.

For example, for taxable intra-community acquisitions at a standard rate, you configure sales tax code **UT_S_EU** with use tax and associate it with the **UseTaxEUPurchaseCurrentGoodsServices** lookup result of **Report field lookup**. In this case, amounts that use the **UT_S_EU** sales tax code are reflected in boxes 10, 11, 36, and 37

Alternatively, you configure two sales tax codes:

- **VAT_S_EU**, which has a tax rate value of -21 percent
- **InVAT_S_EU**, which has a tax rate value of 21 percent

You then associate the codes with lookup results of **Report field lookup** in the following way:

- Associate **VAT_S_EU** with the **VATAccruedEUPurchase** lookup result.
- Associate **InVAT_S_EU** with the **VATDeductionEUPurchaseCurrentGoodsServices** lookup result.

In this case, amounts that use the **VAT_S_EU** sales tax code are reflected in boxes 10 and 11. Amounts that use the **InVAT_S_EU** sales tax code are reflected in boxes 36 and 37.

For more information about how to configure reverse charge VAT, see [Reverse charges](emea-reverse-charge.md).

## Configure system parameters

To generate a VAT declaration, you must configure the tax number (Numero de Identificacion Fiscal [NIF]) of your organization.

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. Select the legal entity, and then select **Registration IDs**.
3. Select or create the address in Spain and then, on the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
4. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that is dedicated to Spain and that uses the **VAT Id** registration category.
5. In the **Registration number** field, enter the tax number.
6. On the **General** tab, in the **Effective** field, enter the date when the number becomes effective.

For more information about how to set up registration categories and registration types, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

## Set up a VAT declaration for Spain

### Import ER configurations

Open the **Electronic reporting** workspace, and import the latest versions of these ER formats:

- VAT Declaration Excel (ES)
- VAT Declaration TXT (ES)

For more information, see [Download ER configurations from the Global repository of Configuration service](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).

### <a name="set-up"></a>Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields

To automatically generate a VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes in the application and lookup results in the ER configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you enable the **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled, parameters that are configured for an earlier version of an ER format automatically become applicable for a later version of the same format. If this feature isn't enabled, you must explicitly configure application-specific parameters for each format version. The **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature is available in the **Feature management** workspace as of Finance version 10.0.23. For more information about how to set up the parameters of an ER format for each legal entity, see [Set up the parameters of an ER format per legal entity](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-app-specific-parameters-set-up.md).

Follow these steps to define which sales tax codes generate which boxes on the VAT declaration.

1. Go to **Workspaces** > **Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT declaration TXT (ES)** configuration, and then select **Configurations \> Application specific parameters setup**.
3. On the **Application specific parameters** page, on the **Lookups** FastTab, select **Report field lookup**.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, set the following fields to associate the sales tax codes and report fields.

   | Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   |------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Lookup result          | Select the value of the report field. For more information about the values and their assignment to VAT declaration rows, see the [VAT declaration overview](#vat-declaration-overview) section earlier in this article.                                                                                               |
   | Tax code               | Select the sales tax code to associate with the report field. Posted tax transactions that use the selected sales tax code will be collected in the appropriate declaration box. We recommend that you separate sales tax codes in such a way that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box. |
   | Transaction classifier | If you created enough sales tax codes to determine a declaration box, select **\*Not blank\***. If you didn't create enough sales tax codes so that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box, you can set up a transaction classifier. The following transaction classifiers are available: </br>-   **Purchase**</br>-   **PurchaseExempt** (tax-exempt purchase)</br>-   **PurchaseReverseCharge** (tax receivable from a purchase reverse charge)</br>-   **Sales**</br>-   **SalesExempt** (tax-exempt sale)</br>-   **SalesReverseCharge** (tax payable from a purchase reverse charge or a sales reverse charge)</br>-   **Use tax**. </br>For each transaction classifier, a classifier for the credit note is also available. For example, one of these classifiers is **PurchaseCreditNote** (purchase credit note).</br>Be sure to create two lines for each sales tax code: one that has the transaction classifier value and one that has the transaction classifier for credit note value. |

   > [!NOTE]
   > Associate all sales tax codes with lookup results. If any sales tax codes should not generate values on the VAT declaration, associate them with the **Other** lookup result.

## Generate a VAT declaration from electronic messages

When you use electronic messages to generate the report, you can collect tax data from multiple legal entities. For more information, see the [Run a VAT declaration for multiple legal entities](#run-a-vat-declaration-for-multiple-legal-entities) section later in this article.

The following procedure applies to the electronic message processing example that you imported earlier from the LCS Shared asset library.

1. Go to **Tax** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Electronic messages** > **Electronic messages**.
2. In the left pane, select **ES VAT declaration**.
3. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **New**, and then, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **OK**.
4. Select the message line that is created, enter a description, and then specify the start and end dates for the declaration.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Steps 5 through 7 are optional.

5. Optional: On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Collect data**, and then select **OK**. The sales tax payments that were generated earlier are added to the message. For more information, see the [Settle and post sales tax](#settle-and-post-sales-tax) section earlier in this article. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
6. Optional: On the **Message items** FastTab, review the sales tax payments that are transferred for processing. By default, all sales tax payments of the selected period that weren't included in any other message of the same processing are included.
7. Optional: Select **Original document** to review the sales tax payments, or select **Delete** to exclude sales tax payments from processing. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
8. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Update status**. In the **Update status** dialog box, select **Ready to generate**, and then select **OK**. Verify that the message status is changed to **Ready to generate**.
9. Select **Generate report**. To preview the VAT declaration amounts, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **Preview report**, and then select **OK**.
10. In the **Electronic reporting parameters** dialog box, set the fields as described in the [Preview the VAT declaration in Excel from the Report sales tax for settlement period periodic task](#preview-the-vat-declaration-in-excel-from-the-report-sales-tax-for-settlement-period-periodic-task) section earlier in this article, and then select **OK**.
11. Select the **Attachments** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select **Open** to open the file.
12. Review the amounts in the Excel document, and then select **Generate report**.
13. To generate a VAT declaration in XML format, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **Generate report**, and then select **OK**.
14. In the **Electronic reporting parameters** dialog box, set the following fields.

      | **Field**                                                                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

5. In the **Datasources setup** grid, add a line for each additional legal entity that must be included in reporting. For each new line, set the following fields.

   | Field                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
