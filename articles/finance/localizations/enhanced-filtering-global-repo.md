# Enhanced filtering options for finding configurations in the Global repository

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes enhanced filtering capabilities for Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) Global repository, which have been improved to include the following filters: 
- **Country/region** - based on ISO country codes  
- **Tags** - for functional/feature area; Industry; Business document type 

You can apply filters, either individually or in groups, to find specific or related configurations. For example, to find all configurable business documents related to vendor invoices, you can apply the **Business document type** filter. 

You can further refine a search by selecting the country code and clicking **Apply filter**.
