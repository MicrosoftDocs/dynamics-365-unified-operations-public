# RCS enhanced filtering options for finding configurations in the RCS/Global repository

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes enhanced filtering capabilities for Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) Global repository, which have been improved to include the ability to filter with the following criteria: 
- **Country/region** - Based on ISO country codes  
- **Tags** types for:
  - Functional area
  - Feature area
  - Industry 
  - Business document 

To make it easier to discover specific or related configurations you can apply filters, either individually or as a group. For example, to find a single type of 'configurable business documents that are related to vendor invoices, you could apply a **Business document type** filter to search for that type of document.

You can further refine the search by selecting document type, for example 'vendor invoice' and clicking **Apply filter**. The following example shows the results when filtering on **Business document type** with the document type added.

Filtered results can be imported into a users RCS repository or a Dynamics 365 Finance environment, either individually or as a set. To do this, select the group of configurations, and click **Import**.
