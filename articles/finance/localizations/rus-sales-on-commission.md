# Sales on commission
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The principal engages the intermediary (commissioner) to sell, in the commissioner's own name, the principal's goods (works or services) to third parties.

The intermediary performs the following actions:

- Register a facture that was issued to a third-party buyer on the **Issued** worksheet of the facture accounting journal when goods are shipped.
- Don't register a facture in the sales book, because the goods belong to the principal, and the intermediary doesn't have the obligation to charge VAT.
- Inform the principal about the facture details, so that the principal can reissue the facture in his or her own name.

After the reissued facture is received from the principal, the commissioner registers it on the **Received** worksheet of the facture accounting journal. However, the commissioner doesn't make an entry in the purchase book.

If the agreement includes prepayment terms, the registration procedure for reissuing a facture is similar.

The following illustration shows the business process for registering intermediary deals. Rectangular elements are reflected in the system. Oval elements are present in the business process but aren't reflected in the system.
