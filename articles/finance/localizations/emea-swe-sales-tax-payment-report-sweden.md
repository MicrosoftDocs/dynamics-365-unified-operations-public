For general information about how to set up the value-added tax (VAT) statement, see [VAT reporting for Europe](emea-vat-reporting.md).

## Set up the report layout for sales tax authorities

To generate a sales tax report in the correct format for the appropriate tax authority, you must first set up the report layout for sales tax authorities.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Indirect taxes** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax authorities.**
2. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, select the sales tax authority that will be used in the sales tax codes for the sales tax settlement period.
3. In the **Report layout** field, select **Swedish report layout**.

## Set up sales tax reporting codes for VAT reporting

Set up sales tax reporting codes by following the instructions in [Set up sales tax reporting codes](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations/blob/SE-VAT-declaration/articles/finance/general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-reporting-codes.md). The following table provides an example of sales tax reporting codes for Sweden.

## Set up sales tax codes

## Generate a sales tax payment and print the Swedish sales tax report

At the end of the VAT reporting period, calculate the sales tax amounts for the settlement period.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Declarations** \> **Sales tax** \> **Settle and post sales tax**.
2. In the **Report sales tax for settlement period** dialog box, set the following fields.

| **Field**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| From date                 | Enter the first date of the sales tax settlement period that sales tax should be calculated for. This value corresponds to the date in the **From** field on the **Sales tax settlement periods** page.                                                                                 |
| Transaction date          | Enter the date when the sales tax report is calculated. The default value is the current date. The sales tax payment is calculated for all transactions that were posted during the settlement period.                                                                                  |

If a sales tax settlement has already been generated, select **Latest corrections**.
