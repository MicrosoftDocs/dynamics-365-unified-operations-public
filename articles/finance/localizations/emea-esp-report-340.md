# Report 340 for Spain

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Report 340 contains information about all invoices and taxes that are related to the invoices that a company has issued or received during a specific period. Report 340 should be submitted to the tax authorities during the first 20 days after the reporting period. The reporting period can be a month or a quarter, depending on the size of the company. The report can be uploaded to the tax authorities' website, or it can be submitted by using a free software package that is available from the tax authorities.

The file format for Report 340 consists of two record types that are based on the file structure.

-   **Type 1** – This record type contains header information about the legal entity that generates the report.
-   **Type 2** – This record type contains information about the items and services that are purchased and sold by a legal entity during a specified period.

## Entries that are included in Report 340

Report 340 includes the following entries:

-   **Sales entries** – Value-added tax (VAT) report lines that correspond to sales invoices and project invoices.
-   **Sales credit memos (corrective invoices)** – VAT report lines that correspond to corrective sales invoices.
-   **Purchase entries** – VAT report lines that correspond to purchase invoices.
-   **Purchase credit memos** – VAT report lines that correspond to corrective purchase invoices.
-   **Auto-invoices and auto-credit memos** – VAT report lines that correspond to invoices and credit memos that are automatically created when goods or services are delivered by a vendor in the European Union (EU).
-   **Invoices that include equivalence charge** – Equivalence charge is a type of Spanish sales tax.
-   **Invoices including different VAT% or equivalence charge percentage (EC%)** – Invoices that have more than one VAT percentage or equivalence charge percentage.
