[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

[!include [banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This topic explains how to configure printable invoice layouts to ensure compliance with Bahraini legal requirements. Bahrain-specific invoice layouts are implemented by using the concept of *configurable business documents*. For more information about configurable business documents, see the [Business document management overview](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-business-document-management.md). 

## Prerequisites

The primary address of the legal entity must be in Bahrain.

## <a id="features"></a>Turn on features

In the **Feature management** workspace, turn on the following features:

- (Bahrain) Credit invoicing layout for sales and project invoice reports
- Convert Electronic reporting outbound documents from Microsoft Office formats to PDF

For more information about how to turn on features, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## <a id="ERConfigs"></a>Import Electronic reporting configurations

In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, import the following Electronic reporting (ER) formats from the repository:

- Sales invoice (Excel) (BH)
- Free text invoice (Excel) (BH)
- Project invoice (Excel) (BH)
- Project contract line items (Excel) (BH)
- Project manage invoice (Excel) (BH)

> [!NOTE]
> These formats are derived from related standard formats, based on the invoice model, and they use the invoice model mapping. All required additional configurations will be automatically imported.

For more information about how to import ER configurations, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

1. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, in the **Related links** section, select **Electronic reporting destination**.
2. On the **Electronic reporting destination** page, create destinations for the following related formats:

    - Sales invoice (Excel) (BH)
    - Free text invoice (Excel) (BH)
    - Project invoice (Excel) (BH)
    - Project contract line items (Excel) (BH)
    - Project manage invoice (Excel) (BH)
 
3. For each format, follow these steps:

    1. Select the **Convert to PDF** check box.
    2. In the **Page orientation** field, select **Portrait**.
    3. Select **Settings**, and then, on the **Destination settings** page, on the **Screen** tab, set the **Enabled** option to **Yes** to enable printing to the screen.
