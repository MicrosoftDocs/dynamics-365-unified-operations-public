[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you run a tax settlement, you might receive an error message. Follow the steps in the sections of this article to fix the error.

## Find the version of the setoff rule that is currently used

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Maintain setoff hierarchy profiles**.
2. Use the values in the **Effective date** column to find the version of the setoff rule that is currently used. For example, customers want to settle transactions for February 19, 2020 (2/19/2020). As the following illustration shows, version 1 of the setoff rule is used, according to the effective date.

4. Determine whether the **Recoverable** and **Payable** nodes are selected or no, according to the setoff. If the nodes are not marked as defined, there might be a posting issue. In this case, you should contact Microsoft.
