# Electronic invoicing onboarding in Saudi Arabia

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Onboarding is mandatory for all taxpayers who are subject to electronic invoicing in Saudi Arabia. As a result of the onboarding process, taxpayers obtain Cryptographic Stamp Identifiers (CSIDs). CSIDs are required for integration with the electronic invoicing portal that is managed by the Saudi Arabian tax authority (ZATCA) and for further submission of electronic invoices.

This article explains how to onboard taxpayers and their electronic invoicing software with Saudi Arabian tax authorities.

## Prerequisites

- The legal entity must be registered as a taxpayer in Saudi Arabia and must have a valid value-added tax (VAT) registration number.
- The legal entity must have the access to the [Saudi Arabian Taxation Portal (ERAD)](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/).

## Onboarding process

The onboarding process consists of two steps:

1. Obtain a Compliance CSID (CCSID), which ZATCA assigns to perform compliance checks of Electronic invoice generation solutions (EGSs).
2. Obtain a Production CSID (PCSID), which ZATCA assigns to compliant EGSs.

### Obtain a CCSID

1. In the [Saudi Arabian Taxation Portal (ERAD)](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/), go to the Onboarding and Management Portal by selecting the relevant tile.
2. On the main landing page of the Onboarding and Management Portal, select the **Onboard new solution unit/device** tile, and then select **Generate OTP code**.
3. Select the number of one-time password (OTP) codes to generate. The number depends on the number of e-invoicing generation units (devices) that will be used.
4. Save the generated OTP codes so that you can use them in later steps.
5. Prepare a configuration file for the certificate signing request. This configuration file should be in the form of a plain text file that contains the following data.

    ```txt
    oid_section = OIDs
    [OIDs]
    certificateTemplateName = 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2
    [req]
    default_bits = 2048
    emailAddress = MyEmail@email.com
    req_extensions = v3_req
    x509_extensions = v3_ca
    prompt = no
    default_md = sha 256
    req_extensions = req_ext
    distinguished_name = dn
    [dn]
    C=SA
    OU=Riyad Branch
    O=Contoso
    CN=EA123456789
    [v3_req]
    basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
    keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment
    [req_ext]
    certificateTemplateName = ASN1:PRINTABLESTRING:TSTZATCACodeSigning
    subjectAltName = dirName:alt_names
    [alt_names]
    SN=MSD365Finance10028
    UID=310122393500003
    title=1100
    registeredAddress= MyAddress
    businessCategory=Industry
    ```

6. In the configuration file, update the **emailAddress** value and the following specific data.

    | Code              | Description | Specification |
    |-------------------|-------------|---------------|
    | C                 | The country/region code. | A two-letter code (ISO 3166 Alpha-2) |
    | OU                | The name of the organization unit. | For normal taxpayers, the value is free text. For VAT groups, identify the value through the eleventh digit of the organization identifier being "1". Validate that the input is a 10-digit Tax Identification Number (TIN). |
    | O                 | The name of the organization or taxpayer. | Free text |
    | CN                | The unique name of the solution or unit. | Free text |
    | SN                | The unique identification code for the solution. | Free text |
    | UID               | The VAT registration number of the taxpayer. | Fifteen digits. This number begins with "3" and ends with "3". |
    | title             | The document type that the taxpayer's solution unit will issue. | Four-digit numerical input that uses "0" and "1" mapped to "TSCZ": 0 = False/Not supported, 1 = True/Supported. T = Tax invoice (standard), S = Simplified tax invoice, C = For future use, Z = For future use. |
    | registeredAddress | The address of the branch or location where the device or solution unit is primarily situated. | Free text |
    | businessCategory  | The industry or sector that the device or solution will generate invoices for. | Free text |

7. Run the [onboarding script](#script) that is provided later in this article. Specify the OTP and configuration file as input parameters. Here is an example:

    `.\OnboardingScript.ps1 -action getComplianceCSID -otp 123345 -csrconfig .\csr_config.txt -password 123`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **password** parameter is optional and can be omitted. If it's included, the certificate that is generated will have the specified password.

8. The CCSID is received as a certificate file in PFX format. Save this CCSID certificate file in the Microsoft Azure key vault. For more information, see [Customer certificates and secrets](e-invoicing-customer-certificates-secrets.md).
9. Configure the related feature setup in the **Saudi Arabian electronic invoice (SA)** electronic invoicing feature, and reference the CCSID certificate that you saved in the key vault. The certificate will be used for communication with the ZATCA electronic invoicing portal.

### Obtain a PCSID

To obtain a PCSID, you must correctly configure the solution for electronic invoice generation and submission, and the solution must be fully functioning. To achieve this result, you must complete all the required preliminary configuration steps. For more information, see [Get started with Electronic invoicing for Saudi Arabia](e-invoicing-sa-get-started.md).

To check compliance, generate all types of sample invoices that you plan to issue, based on your business needs, and submit them to ZATCA. Use the standard process for issuing electronic invoices. For more information, see [Issue electronic invoices in Finance and Supply Chain Management](e-invoicing-issuing-electronic-invoices-finance-supply-chain-management.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to invoices, you must generate and submit credit note and debit note samples when you obtain a PCSID to register all types of documents that might be issued.

1. Make sure that all electronic invoices are successfully submitted to ZATCA.
2. Run the [onboarding script](#script) that is provided later in this article. Specify the CCSID as an input parameter. Here is an example:

    `.\OnboardingScript.ps1 -action getProductionCSID -password 123`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **password** parameter is optional and can be omitted. If it's included, the certificate that is generated will have the specified password.

3. The PCSID is received as a certificate file in PFX format. Save this PCSID certificate file in the key vault.
4. Configure the related feature setup in the **Saudi Arabian electronic invoice (SA)** electronic invoicing feature. Replace the previously configured CCSID certificate with the obtained CCSID certificate that you saved in the key vault.

After you complete all the configurations steps, the system is ready to be used in production mode.

To review obtained CSIDs on the ZATCA side, use the **Review Existing Cryptographic Stamp Identifier (CSID)** tile on the landing page of the Onboarding and Management Portal. This portal is accessible from the main [Saudi Arabian Taxation Portal (ERAD)](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/).

1. Use the following Windows PowerShell script to obtain a CCSID and a PCSID.

    ```powershell
