# Land tax declaration 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


According to the tax code of the Russian Federation, land assets are subject to
land tax. The tax period for land tax is one year. At the end of the tax period,
a company must report a land tax declaration.

The land tax declaration should be submitted to the tax authority where the land
is located. In this case, code **270** should be entered for the **at place of**
attribute. However, the greatest taxpayers can submit declarations to the tax
authority where the organization is registered as a greatest taxpayer. In this
case, code **213** should be entered for the **at place of** attribute.

The tax base for the calculation of land tax is the cadastral cost of the land
asset. The cadastral cost is defined by cadastral authorities and should be
specified by the user on the fixed asset card.

    | Benefit type    | Select the type of tax allowance. The following values are applicable to land tax allowances: **Exemption from tax**, **Tax base reduction**, **Reduction of tax rate**, **Reduction of tax amount**, and **Non-taxable area share**. |
    | Name            | Enter the name of the tax allowance.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | Allowance value | Define the tax allowance value, depending on type of tax allowance that you selected in the **Benefit type** field:                                                                                                                   |

    -   **Exemption from tax:** Don't define the allowance value, because exemption
    from tax is always considered 100 percent, and the tax amount is 0 (zero).

    -   **Tax base reduction:** Define the amount, in the local currency, that is
    reducing the tax base amount for each asset.

    -   **Reduction of tax rate:** Define the percentage of the tax rate reduction.
    For example, if the tax rate is 10 percent, and the allowance value is 2
    percent, the reduced tax rate is 8 percent.

    -   **Reduction of tax amount:** Define the amount, in the local currency, that
    is reducing the calculated tax amount for each asset.

    -   **Non-taxable area share:** A value will be defined for each land asset in
    the fixed asset record.

### Assign tax allowances to a sales tax code as a reduction of the tax rate, a reduction of the tax amount, and a tax base reduction

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Tax reporting \> Sales tax
    relations**.

2.  Select the record for the sales tax code.

    address book \> Registration types \> Registration types**), create a
    registration type.

    2.  On the **Registration categories** page (**Organization administration \>
    Global address book \> Registration types \> Registration categories**),
    assign the new registration type to the **RCOAD** registration category.

    3.  In the **Registration number** field, enter the OKTMO code for the legal
    entity's location.

### Set up tax authorities and related OKTMO codes

        location, the tax authority that assessed tax is reported to is defined
        as the tax authority that has the same OKTMO code as the legal entity.

### Optional: Set up company divisions, their registration reason codes (KPP), and their OKTMO codes

If the organization has land assets that are located in territories that differ
from the organization's main location, or if the organization has separate
subdivisions, you should set up company divisions.

    account. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type
    that is associated with the **KPP** registration category.

### Set up the organization's locations and assign them to company divisions

If the organization has land assets that are located in territories that differ
from the organization's main location, or if the organization has separate
subdivisions, you should set up organization locations and assign them to
company divisions.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Location**.

2.  Select an existing location, or create a new location.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Separate division ID** field, select
    the company division that you created in the previous procedure.
    
    If the **Separate division ID** field is left blank, the location is the
    same as the location of the organization's head office.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For land assets that are located in territories that differ from
    the organization's main location, the tax authority that land tax is
    reported to is defined as the tax authority that has the same OKTMO code as
    the separate division that is associated with the land location. 
    >
    > For information about how to associate a fixed asset with a location, see the
    [Specify the location of the land](#specify-the-location-of-the-land)
    section later in this topic.


### Set up territories for distributed land assets

If a land asset is distributed among several territories, it should be reported
under the appropriate OKTMO code. You should set up distribution territories,
assign an OKTMO code to each territory, and associate the OKTMO codes with tax
authorities.

> [!NOTE]
>  Alternatively, create all the OKTMO codes, and then assign a code to the tax authority on the **RCOAD codes** page (**Tax \> Setup \> Sales tax \> RCOAD codes**).

### Set up Fixed assets parameters for posting land tax

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Setup \> Parameters**.

2.  On the **Number sequences** tab, for the **Assessed tax registers journal
    number** reference, select a number sequence for the tax register.

3.  On the **Tax reporting** tab, in the **Land tax** section, in the **Sales
    tax code** field, select the default sales tax code for land tax.

4.  In the **Compression** field, select the level of compression for land tax
    transactions:

    -  **Tax** – A detailed ledger journal for land tax transactions will be
    created for each sales tax code.

    -  **Total** – A ledger journal for land tax transactions will be created as
    one line that has the default sales tax code.

5.  Close the page.

### Set up the journal for posting land tax

If land tax transactions will be automatically created based on calculated tax
registers, you should set up a journal.

1.  In the **Account for FA taxes** field, select a ledger account for the land
    tax expenses.

2.  Make sure that the **Sales tax payable** field is set to the ledger account
    code that you entered for the ledger posting group in step 3.

Create a land asset and set up parameters for land tax calculation
------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an overview of the steps for creating a land asset and setting up
parameters for land tax calculation:

1.  Create a land fixed asset and define parameters for land tax calculation

2.  [Specify the location of the land](#specify-the-location-of-the-land)

3.  [Specify the distribution for a land asset that is located in several
    territories](#specify-the-distribution-for-a-land-asset-that-is-located-in-several-territories)

4.  [Change the cadastral cost of land and specify the tax allowance
    history](#change-the-cadastral-cost-of-land-and-specify-the-tax-allowance-history)

5.  [Change the cadastral cost of a distributed land
    asset](#change-the-cadastral-cost-of-a-distributed-land-asset)

### Create a land fixed asset and define parameters for land tax calculation

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select an existing fixed asset, or create a new fixed asset.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Ground area**.

4.  In the **Flag of ownership** field, select whether the fixed asset is owned,
    under operational management, leased, or owned by someone who is outside
    Russia.

5.  On the **Technical information** FastTab, set the **Category** and
    **Cadastral number** fields for the land asset.

6.  Set the **Start date of building** field if the land was acquired for
    housing construction. Special coefficients that depend on the building
    period will be applied to land assets of this type when land tax is
    calculated. If the construction period exceeded three years during the tax
    period, the land tax declaration will include two occurrences of Section 3:
    one occurrence for land tax before three years passed and one occurrence for
    land tax after three years passed.

7.  On the **Tax reporting** FastTab, in the **Land tax** section, in the **Tax
    base** field, enter the cadastral cost of the land.

8.  In the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code for the assessed
    tax calculation.

9.  If you partially own the fixed asset, in the **Owned share numerator** and
    **Owned share denominator** fields, define your ownership share as a simple
    fraction.

### Specify the location of the land

By default, the assumption is that land assets are located at the organization's
location and reported to the tax authority in the legal entity's territory. (The
OKTMO code of the tax authority matches the OKTMO code of the legal entity, and
land assets are reported under the same OKTMO code.)

If the organization has land assets that are located in different territories
and registered in different tax authorities, you must specify the location of
the land asset.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the line for the land asset.

3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **History** group,
    select **Transfer**.

4.  Create a line.

5.  Set the **Date** and **New location** fields.

### Specify the distribution for a land asset that is located in several territories

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the line for the land asset.

3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **Distribution**
    group, select **Distribution**.

4.  Create a line.

5.  In the **Location** field, select a territory.

6.  Review the values in the **RCOAD** and **Sales tax code** fields. These
    values are automatically entered from the territory location record.

7.  In the **Tax base** field, specify the cadastral cost of the land in the
    specified territory.

8.  If you partially own the fixed asset, in the **Owned share numerator** and
    **Owned share denominator** fields, define your ownership share in the
    specified territory as a simple fraction.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When the line for the change in cadastral value is created, the **Tax base** and **Sales tax** fields in the fixed asset record can no longer be edited.

### Change the cadastral cost of land and specify the tax allowance history

The cadastral cost of a land asset might change because of a change in
qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Follow these steps to record a
change in cadastral value.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the line for the land asset.

3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **History** group,
    select **Tax reporting data**.

4.  Create a line.

5.  In the **Period** field, specify the month when the cadastral value is
    changing.

6.  In the **Tax base** field, specify the new cadastral value of the land. Also
    specify any other values that have changed: **Category**, **Cadastral
    number**, **Owned share numerator**, or **Owned share denominator**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this change is the first change in cadastral value, you must also create a line for the previous values that were originally entered in the fixed asset record.
    >  
    > When the line for the change in cadastral value is created, corresponding fields in the fixed asset record can no longer be edited. They show the actual values from the tax reporting data history record.
    >  
    > Use the **History of tax reporting data** page to define the history of tax allowance changes.

7.  In the **Land tax exemption (art 387)** field, specify the code for the tax
    allowance as an exemption from tax in accordance with federal law.
    Alternatively, in the **Land tax exemption (art 395)** field, specify the
    code for the tax allowance as an exemption from tax in accordance with
    regional law.

8.  Set the **Land tax allowance as non-taxable share** field, if it's
    applicable.

    When the values for tax allowances are added, corresponding fields in the fixed asset record show the actual values from the tax reporting data history record.

### Change the cadastral cost of a distributed land asset

If the cadastral cost of a land asset that is located in several territories
changes, follow these steps to specify the new cadastral cost in each territory.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Common \> Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the line for the land asset.

3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Fixed asset** tab, in the **Distribution**
    group, select **Distribution**.

4.  Select the line for the distribution, and then, on the Action Pane, select
    **History**.

5.  Create a line.

6.  In the **Period** field, specify the month when the cadastral value is
    changing.

7.  In the **Tax base** field, specify the new cadastral value of the land. Also
    specify any other values that have changed: **Owned share numerator** or
    **Owned share denominator**.

> [!NOTE] 
> If this change is the first change in cadastral value, you must also create a line for the previous values that were originally entered in the distribution record.
>
> When the line for the change in cadastral value is created, corresponding fields in the distribution record can no longer be edited. They show the actual values from the history record.

Calculate land tax registers
----------------------------

After you've finished the setup, registered the acquisition of land assets, and
set up all land asset parameters for land tax calculation, you must calculate
land tax registers. The following tax registers are available:

-   **Land tax – ground areas** – This tax register calculates land tax for each
    land asset. For each land asset that is located in a territory that is
    specified by an OKTMO code, the register shows the following information:

    -   The land category and cadastral number.

-   **Design and building period** – The possible values are **3 years** and
        **More than 3 years**.

    -   The cadastral cost, and the owned share as a simple fraction.

    -   Tax allowance codes and amounts.

    -   The tax base in the specified territory and the tax rate.

    -   The ownership period and factor, if the land was acquired or sold during
        the period, or if the housing building period exceeded three years
        during the period.

    -   The cost change period and factor, if the cadastral cost changed during
        the period.

-   **Calculated advance payment/Tax** – If the tax register is calculated
        for the first quarter, second quarter, or third quarter, the tax advance
        amount before tax allowances are applied as a reduction of the tax rate
        or a reduction of tax amount. If the tax register is calculated for the
        year, the land tax amount before tax allowances are applied as a
        reduction of the tax rate or a reduction of the tax amount.

-   **Advance payment amount/Tax amount** – If the tax register is
        calculated for the first quarter, second quarter, or third quarter, the
        final tax advance amount. If the tax register is calculated for the
        year, the final land tax amount.

-   **Land tax** – This tax register calculates total land tax amounts for each
    sales tax code and OKTMO code.

To calculate and approve land tax registers, follow these steps.

1.  Go to **Fixed assets (Russia) \> Journals \> Tax register journal**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  In the **Type of tax** field, either select **Land tax** to create a journal
