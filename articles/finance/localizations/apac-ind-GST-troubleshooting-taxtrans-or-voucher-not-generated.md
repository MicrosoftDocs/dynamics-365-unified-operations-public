Complete the steps in this article if after posting tax there are records missing when you check the voucher and posted sales tax.

## Check if the subledger journal transferred. 

1. Go to **General ledger** > **Periodic tasks** > **Subledger journal entries not yet transferred**.
2. Transfer any record in the list, and then check the voucher and posted sales tax again.

## Check tax configuration

1. Check the posting profile of the expected measure. Select the posting type in the **Debit/Credit** column, and then select **Edit**. 
2. Check the value of tax accounting provider.

  The following is the rule for posting tax transactions and vouchers that are decided by the tax accounting provider. Correct the configuration if it's not working as expected.

  | **Tax accounting provider** | **Posting tax transaction** | **Posting voucher** |
  | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
  | Tax                         | Yes                         | Yes                 |
  | Ledger                      | No                          | Yes                 |
  | Other                       | No                          | No                  |

## Check the formula
