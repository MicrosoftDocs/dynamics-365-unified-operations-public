# Inventory adjustment wizard

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


The **Inventory adjustment** wizard is used to adjust on-hand inventory or inventory transactions. Before you adjust on-hand inventory, it must be closed. For more information about inventory closing, see [Inventory close](../../supply-chain/cost-management/inventory-close.md) and [Inventory cost structure](rus-inventory-cost-structure.md).

You can adjust the amount of an item in the warehouse in a settlement with an arbitrary ledger account, and you can post a negative adjustment as a reversal.

In addition to adjusting the cost in the primary currency, you can adjust the cost in a secondary currency.

In the Russian localization, these features are available through the **Inventory adjustment** wizard. The wizard lets you use the following methods of adjustment: **Item cost price**, **Fixed cost price**, **Amount**, **Value**, **Percent**, and **From ledger account**. You can adjust the cost price of items by using miscellaneous charges. You can also use the wizard to determine the amount that must be allocated to the item cost price, based on the balance of the ledger account. You can select the set of dimensions to determine the account balance.

## Preliminary setup

Before you can adjust item cost by using miscellaneous charges and the **Inventory adjustment** wizard, verify that you've completed the prerequisites in the Inventory cost structure (here will be link to the topic from content deliverable 148943) topic.

Additionally, before you can adjust item cost in a secondary currency, verify that you've completed the prerequisites in the Inventory valuation in secondary currency (here will be link to the topic from content deliverable 148936) topic.

         - If the miscellaneous charges code isn't entered on the item line, and the **Corr. account profit/loss** option on the **Posting** page is set to **Yes**, the adjustment is assigned in the standard manner to the offset profit or loss account that is set up on the **Inventory** tab of the **Posting** page (**Inventory management \> Setup \> Posting \> Posting**).

    ![Balance from ledger account or dimensions page, Allocation principle field](media/11%20Balance%20from%20ledger%20account%20or%20dimensions.png)

7. Select **Next**.
8. Complete the remaining steps of the adjustment as described in the [Adjust item cost by using the Inventory adjustment wizard](#adjust-item-cost-using-inventory-adjustment-wizard) section.

This method determines the balance of the account in the context of financial dimensions only to determine the amount of the adjustment. It doesn't automatically close the balance on the dimensions at the item cost price of the inventory.

#### Example

On account 26.100, the **Department** dimension accumulates the amounts that you want to allocate to the cost of inventory that is accounted for in specific warehouses. To complete this process in the system, follow these steps.

1. Close the inventory before the end of the closing period.
2. Open the **Inventory adjustment** wizard, select the **On-hand** method of adjustment, and then select **Next**.
3. On the **Select on-hand inventory** page, set the following fields:

    - On the **Parameters** FastTab, set the **Warehouse** option to **Yes**.
    - On the **Records to include** FastTab, select **Filter**, and specify a filter for a specific warehouse or warehouses.

4. Select **Next**.
5. On the **Functions for calculating adjustment amounts** page, select **From ledger account**, and then select **Next**.
6. On the **Balance from ledger account or dimensions** page, set the following fields:

    - In the **Main account** field, select main account **26.100**.
    - In the **Balance on the date** field, specify the date when the balance is determined.
    - Select the **Balance from ledger account and dimensions** option, and then, in the **Dimension set** field, select the dimension set.

7. Select **Next**.
8. On the next page, select the lines for the **Department** dimension values from which the balances should be assigned to the inventory of the selected warehouse or warehouses, and then select **Next**.
9. Set the **Corr. account profit/loss** option to **Yes**, and set the **Corr. account** field.
10. Complete the remaining steps of the adjustment as described in the [Adjust item cost by using the Inventory adjustment wizard](#adjust-item-cost-using-inventory-adjustment-wizard) section. Repeat the allocation operation for all warehouses and dimensions that you want to do allocation for.

As you've seen, the system lets you determine the adjustment amount based on the balance on the account in the context of the dimensions. You can also allocate it to the cost price of inventory or warehouse receipts.
