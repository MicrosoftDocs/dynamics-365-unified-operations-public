# Cash flow tax registers

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Overview

Cash flow tax registers are generated based on accounting data from general ledger transactions. There are two types of tax registers:

   - **Cash payment receipt (Cash flow = Pay in)**: The cash inflow tax register is designed to consolidate cash inflow information to identify either income that is related to current and future periods, or transactions that determine future expenses.
   - **Cash payment issue (Cash flow = Expense)**: The cash outflow tax register is designed to consolidate cash outflow information to identify either expenses that are related to current and future periods, or transactions that determine future income.

Cash accounts include the following types of accounts:

   - **Cash**: This type includes the company's cash accounts (ledger account **50**).
   - **Bank**: This type includes accounts that reflect the balance on bank accounts (ledger accounts **51**, **52**, and **55.1** for accounting for letters of credit).
   - **Other**: This type includes other special cash accounts.

Accounting transactions where ledger account **57** (**Transfers in transit**) is specified as a credit account should be excluded from the tax registers. The following types of accounting transactions should also be excluded:

   - Debit ledger account **51** = credit ledger account **50** (**Deposited to the bank in cash**)
   - Debit ledger account **50** = credit ledger account **51** (**Received from the bank in cash**)

## Set up the tax registers

### Set up account interval groups for Bank, Cash, and Other account types

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Profit tax** > **Account interval groups**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
3. In the **Interval group** field, enter a name for the new account interval group. For this example, enter **Bank**.
4. On the **Account intervals** FastTab, select **Add**.
5. In the **Account (Interval: From)** field, select a ledger account. For this example, select **51.000**.
6. In the **Account (Interval: To)** field, select a ledger account. For this example, select **51.999**.
7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 to create a second account interval group that is named **Cash**, for ledger accounts **50.000** through **50.999**, and a third account interval group that is named **Transfers in transit**, for ledger accounts **57.000** through **57.999**.

### Assign expense codes to tax registers and set up exceptions

Follow these steps to set up expenses for the **Cash payment issue** and **Cash payment receipt** tax registers.

1. Go to **Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Profit tax &gt; Registers**.
2. Select the tax register, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Expense codes**.
3. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
4. In the **Expense code** field, select the expense code. The tax register will reflect transactions that have the selected expense code.
5. In the **Condition name** field, enter a description.
6. On the **Exceptions** FastTab, create the following exceptions to specify that the tax register won't reflect the cash flow between cash accounts and bank accounts, or the cash flow for transfer accounts:

    To exclude transactions from cash accounts to bank accounts, select **Add**, and then set the following fields:

      - **Debit** fields: Set the first **Valid for** field to **Group** and the **Debit account** field to **Bank**.
      - **Credit** fields: Set the second **Valid for** field to **Group** and the **Credit account** field to **Cash**.

    To exclude transactions from bank accounts to cash accounts, select **Add**, and then set the following fields:

      - **Debit** fields: Set the first **Valid for** field to **Group** and the **Debit account** field to **Cash**.
      - **Credit** fields: Set the second **Valid for** field to **Group** and the **Credit account** field to **Bank**.

    To exclude transactions for transfers in transit, select **Add**, and then set the following fields:

      - **Debit** fields: Set the first **Valid for** field to **All**.
      - **Credit** fields: Set the second **Valid for** field to **Group** and the **Credit account** field to **Transfer**.
