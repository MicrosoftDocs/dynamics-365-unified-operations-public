[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the European Union (EU) sales list report that is based on form U13. The Austrian EU sales list report contains information about the sale of goods and services for reporting in XML format.

The following fields are included on the Austrian EU sales list report:

- **EU sales list header:**

    - Reporting period
    - Authority ID
    - Company tax registration number
    - Date and time of the report creation

- **EU sales list lines:**

    - Customer VAT ID
    - The total amount of items
    - The total amount of services
    - Total amount of the triangular trade

## Setup

For general setup information, see [EU Sales list reporting](emea-eu-sales-list.md#prerequisites).

>[!NOTE] 
>The company's tax registration number will be shown in the .xml file for the EU sales list report.

### Set up company information

First create a registration type and assign it to the **VAT ID** registration category for Austria and all the countries or regions that your company does business with. For more information, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

Then follow these steps to set up information about your company.

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. In the grid, select your company.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Registration IDs**.
4. On the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
5. On the **Overview** tab, in the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that you created earlier.
6. Enter your company's value-added tax (VAT) ID.
7. Optional: On the **General** tab, in the **General** section, change the period that the VAT ID is used for.
8. Close the page.

> [!NOTE] 
> If the **VAT exempt number export** field in the **Intrastat** section of the **Foreign trade and logistics** FastTab is set (that is, it isn't blank), the value will be used, instead of the VAT ID that you created in step 6, in the .xlsx file for the EU sales list report.
