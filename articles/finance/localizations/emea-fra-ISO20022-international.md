Before you can set the ISO20022 payment format, you need to import the most recent versions of the following Electronic reporting configuration from Lifecycle Services (LCS):

- ISO20022 Credit transfer (FR): All required model and model mapping configurations will be imported automatically with this.

For more information about the import process, see [Import ISO20022 credit transfer configuration](tasks/import-iso20022-credit-transfer-configuration.md).
