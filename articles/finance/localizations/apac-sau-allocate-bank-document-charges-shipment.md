[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can allocate bank document charges that are posted in the general journal to purchase order lines. The purchase order should have a related letter of credit or import collection.

## Prerequisites

Before you start to allocate the bank document charges, [set up bank facilities and posting profiles for letters of credit](../cash-bank-management/tasks/set-up-bank-facilities-posting-profiles-letter-credit.md), and create a purchase order that has an [imported letter of credit](../cash-bank-management/tasks/import-letter-credit.md).

## Set up a charge code for bank document charges

Follow these steps to set up a charge code for bank document charges.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Charges setup** \> **Charges code**.
2. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Debit** section, in the **Type** field, select **Item**. The **Bank document charge code** option in the **Bank document charge** section becomes available.
3. Set the **Bank document charge code** option to **Yes**. The **Type** field in the **Credit** section is automatically set and can't be edited.
