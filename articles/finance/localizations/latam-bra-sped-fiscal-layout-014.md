# SPED fiscal ICMS-IPI layout 014 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up and generate the SPED fiscal statement layout 014. This layout is applicable as of January 2020 under the practical guide, **EFD-ICMS/IPI – version 3.0.3**.

To view the new layout, go to **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Tax statements parameters** \> **Sped fiscal** \> **Sped fiscal parameters** \> **Layout version**.

## Record 0002: Classification of fiscal establishment

Record 0002 is generated when the **IND\_ATIV** field of record 0000 is set to **0** (zero), and the classification of the fiscal establishment is configured and assigned. To configure the classification and assign it to the fiscal establishment, go to **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Tax statements parameters** \> **Sped fiscal** \> **Sped fiscal parameters** \> **Classification**.

If more than one type of classification applies to the fiscal establishment, select the most relevant classification.

## Record C500: Incoming fiscal documents

Record C500 is generated for incoming fiscal document models 6, 66, 29, and 28. The following new fields are included as part of the new layout.

| Number | Field          | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| 28     | CHV\_DOCe      | If the fiscal document model is 66, the access key of the fiscal document. Otherwise, this field is blank. |
| 29     | FIN\_DOCe      | If the fiscal document model is 66, the fixed value **1**. Otherwise, this field is blank. |
| 30     | CHV\_DOCe\_REF | If the fiscal document model is 66, the access key of the referenced fiscal document, if a referenced fiscal document exists. Otherwise, this field is blank. |
| 31     | IND\_DEST      | The fixed value **1**, because the fiscal establishment is the ICMS taxpayer. |
| 32     | COD\_MUN\_DEST | The IBGE code of the fiscal establishment. |
| 33     | COD\_CTA       | The expense or asset main account posted for the fiscal document |

## Complement and compensation of ICMS-ST tax

The tax authority has introduced records C180, C185, 1010, and 1250 to record details of the operations that are subject to ICMS-ST tax when the company applies the complement and compensation of ICMS-ST tax. Each state will address the generation of these records.

### Prerequisites

Before you enable the generation of records C180, C185, 1010, and 1250, you must enable the calculation of presumed tax. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Brazilian parameters** \> **Fiscal document**, and turn on the following parameters:
	
- ICMS-ST presumed tax
- ICMS-ST presumed tax in fiscal books

Next, follow these steps to set up the rule that will enable the generation of the records. The rule must be set up for each state.

1. Go to **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Fiscal books parameters per state**.
2. Select the related state. For example, for São Paulo state, select **SP**.
3. Set the **Enable record C180 and C185** option to **Yes** to generate the related records. In addition to this, instances of record H030 with the **MOT\_INV** field is set to **06**, H005, 1010, 1250, and 1255 will also be generated.
4. In the **SPED presumed tax calculation algorithm** field, select the method of calculation. The amounts that are calculated in the presumed tax process will be reported in record C185.

### Table 5.7 – Reason code table for complement and restitution

Table 5.7 represents the classification for the complement and restitution (compensation) of ICMS-ST amounts. This table is implemented by each state. To configure it, go to **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Reason code for complement and restitution**.

![Code of reason for restitution or complement page](media/bra-sped-fiscal014-table57-setup.png)

After you've finished configuring the reason code table (table 5.7), you must go to **Fiscal books** \> **Setup** \> **Table 5.7 determination** and set up the determination for it by using the following criteria:

- Item code
- CFOP code
- Taxation code
