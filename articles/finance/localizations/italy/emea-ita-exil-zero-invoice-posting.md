# Posting invoices with zero amount

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

In Italy, you must post financial transactions for invoices that have a total amount of 0 (zero).

## Prerequisites

Before you can post financial transactions for invoices that have a total amount of 0 (zero), the following prerequisites must be met:

- The primary address of the legal entity is in Italy.
- In the **Feature management** workspace, turn on the **Posting invoices with zero amount** feature. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Posting invoices that have an amount of 0 (zero)

The Posting invoices with zero amount feature applies to invoices that you create in the **Accounts receivable** and **Accounts payable** modules.

When you post invoices that have an amount of 0 (zero), the system creates customer or vendor transactions and voucher transactions.
