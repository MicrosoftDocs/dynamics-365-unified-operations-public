# Configure system parameters to report sales tax books for Italy

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure system parameters to report sales tax books for legal entities in Italy.

As of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.39, the Italian sales tax books functionality supports reporting of Italian sales tax books in the [Electronic reporting (ER) tool](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting). It also accommodates reporting for [multiple value-added tax (VAT) registrations](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md).

## Address of the legal entity

The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy. (Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities** \> **Addresses** \> **Country/region**.)

As of Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.39, the ER format of Italian sales tax books can be generated from a legal entity that has a primary address that's outside Italy. In this scenario, you must set up an address and a tax registration number in Italy. For more information, see [Set up a VAT ID for a legal entity, customers, and vendors](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md#set-up-a-vat-id-for-a-legal-entity-customers-and-vendors).

## <a id="number-sequences"></a>Number sequences and number sequence groups

Set up as many number sequences and number sequence groups as you require to cover all the required types of sales tax transactions. For more information about number sequences in Finance, see [Number sequences overview](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/number-sequence-overview).

For continuous numbering of documents in Italian sales tax books, number sequences must be continuous, and they must have the **Company** scope.

In parameters of the **Accounts receivable**, **Accounts payable**, and **Project management and accounting** modules in Finance, you can set up number sequence groups to allocate specific number sequences to specific customers or vendors.

### Accounts receivable parameters

To set up number sequence groups in Accounts receivable parameters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.
2. On the **Number sequence** tab, in the **Reference** column, select **Free text invoice**.
3. Select the **Group** button above the grid.
4. On the **Number sequence groups** page, define the required number sequence groups. On the **References** FastTab, associate each number sequence that you previously set up with the appropriate area. The **Sales tax book section** column shows the sales tax book section that's associated with the selected number sequence when you set up [sales tax book sections](emea-ita-sales-tax-books.md#sales-tax-book-sections).
5. For vouchers to follow the number sequences of the related invoices and credit notes, you must select the **Reuse numbers** checkbox when you define the number sequences for those invoices and credit notes. For example, on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page, on the **Number sequences** tab, select the **Reuse numbers** checkbox for **Free text invoice voucher** to synchronize number allocation for free text invoice vouchers and free text invoices.

### Accounts payable parameters

To set up number sequence groups in Accounts payable parameters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts payable parameters**.
2. On the **Number sequence** tab, in the **Reference** column, select **Internal invoice**.
3. Select the **Group** button above the grid.
4. On the **Number sequence groups** page, define the required number sequence groups. On the **References** FastTab, associate each number sequence that you previously set up with the appropriate area. The **Sales tax book section** column shows the sales tax book section that's associated with selected number sequence when you set up [sales tax book sections](emea-ita-sales-tax-books.md#sales-tax-book-sections).
5. For vouchers to follow the number sequences of the related invoices and credit notes, you must select the **Reuse numbers** checkbox when you define the number sequences for those invoices and credit notes.

### Project management and accounting parameters

To set up number sequence groups in Project management and accounting parameters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Project management and accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Project management and accounting parameters**.
2. On the **Number sequence** tab, in the **Reference** column, select **Invoice voucher**.
3. Select the **Group** button above the grid.
4. On the **Number sequence groups** page define the required number sequence groups. On the **References** FastTab, associate each number sequence that you previously set up with the appropriate area. The **Sales tax book section** column shows the sales tax book section that's associated with the selected number sequence when you set up [sales tax book sections](emea-ita-sales-tax-books.md#sales-tax-book-sections).
5. For vouchers to follow the number sequences of the related invoices and credit notes, you must select the **Reuse numbers** checkbox when you define the number sequences for those invoices and credit notes.

## Journal names

Set up the required journal names.

To set up journal names for General ledger, go to **General ledger** \> **Journal setup** \> **Journal names**.

To set up journal names for Project management and accounting parameters, go to **Project management and accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Journals** \> **Journal names**.

The following table shows the recommended setup of journal name parameters for legal entities that report Italian sales tax books.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Number allocation at posting | Yes |
| Italian sales tax book | <ul><li><strong>Not included</strong> – Select this value for invoices and credit notes that come from countries/regions that are outside the European community.</li><li><strong>Purchase</strong> – Select this value for purchase invoices and credit notes.</li><li><strong>Sales</strong> – Select this value for sales invoices and credit notes.</li><li><strong>Empty</strong> – Select this value for all other types of transactions.</li></ul><p>In some cases, the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field is automatically set based on the value of the <strong>Journal type</strong> field. For example, if the <strong>Journal type</strong> field is set to <strong>Invoice register</strong>, the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field is set to <strong>Purchase</strong> by default.</p> |
| Voucher series | Select a number sequence that you set up in the [Number sequences and number sequence groups](#number-sequences) section of this article. |

## General ledger parameters

The Italian localization doesn't support corrections to the Italian sales tax payment report for a sales tax period that's already settled. Therefore, on the **General ledger parameters** page, on the **Sales tax** tab, in the **Special report** section, set the **Include corrections** option to **No**.

## Company, vendor, and customer fiscal codes and tax registration numbers

> When [Tax Calculation service](../global/global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md) is used, and functionality for [multiple VAT registration numbers](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md) is enabled, you must set up [registration IDs](../europe/emea-registration-ids.md) to define the tax exempt number (tax registration number) of your legal entity, customers, and vendors, as described in [Set up a VAT ID for a legal entity, customers, and vendors](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md#set-up-a-vat-id-for-a-legal-entity-customers-and-vendors).
