# Support for multiple VAT registration numbers in the VAT return of Poland (JPK-V7M)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

As of Finance version 10.0.29, the JPK-V7M feature lets you file a VAT return for [multiple VAT registrations](emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md). 

For more information about how to set up and use the JPK-V7M feature in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, 
see [VAT declaration with registers (JPK-V7M, VDEK)](emea-pol-vdek.md).

If you want to be able to report a VAT return of Poland from a legal entity that has a primary address outside of Poland, 
we recommend that you use the [Tax Calculation](global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md) service, 
and that you enable the [Support multiple VAT registration numbers](emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md) 
feature in the **Feature management** workspace.
