## Invoices

The form **M-15** invoice for the release of materials is a document that is the basis for the movement of material values from one organization to another.

The form **TORG-12** invoice is a document that is the basis for the transfer of inventory items from one organization to another.

### Set up number sequences for invoices

You can use the **Accounts receivable parameters** page to set up number sequences for sales invoices and corrective invoices that are posted in the **M-15** and **TORG-12** formats. For all the selected number sequences, the **Continuous** option should be set to **Yes**.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Accounts receivable parameters**.
2. On the **Number sequences** tab, in the **Number sequence code** field, select a number sequence code for the following references.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

## Product receipts

### Set up number sequences for product receipts

Before you work with product receipts, you must set up number sequences for them. The number sequence that you select for a product receipt is assigned when the document is posted.
