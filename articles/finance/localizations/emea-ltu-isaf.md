# i.SAF reporting for Lithuania

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to Order No VA-55, "On the Approval of Rules for the Processing and Submitting of the Data Taxes Invoice Registers", which was approved by the Head of the State Tax Inspectorate under the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Lithuania in 2004 April 21, the processing and submission of data about value added tax invoice registers is updated to create conditions for the taxable persons to present the data of issued and received invoices for the Tax Authority using standardized format for the i.SAF application. The i.SAF format must match the current standard of accounting data files technical specifications and technical requirements (FileVersion iSAF1.2).

## Overview

This topic describes how to set up Electronic Reporting (ER) configurations for i.SAF report and how to set up and use Electronic Messages (EM) functionality in Dynamics 365 Finance.

The topic includes information about the following:

- Import and set up ER configurations and application-specific parameters
- Set up EM functionality
- Work with EM functionality to prepare i.SAF report.

## Import and set up Electronic Reporting configurations

To prepare Finance for i.SAF reporting, you must import the following ER configurations.

| Configuration name	| Configuration type |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Invoices Communication Model	| Data model |
| i.SAF model mapping	| Model mapping |
| i.SAF format (LT) |	Format	|

Import the latest versions of these configurations. The version description usually includes the number of the Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) article that explains the changes that were introduced in the configuration version.

> [!NOTE]
> After all the ER configurations from the preceding table are imported, set the **Default for model mapping** option to **Yes** for  **i.SAF model mapping** ER configuration.

For more information about how to download ER configurations from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

## Standard VAT codes and application-specific parameters setup

Table 1 “VAT table” of the **“Tables of the Technical Specification of the Standard Accounting Data File”** (here and further “Standard VAT codes”) defines the following standard VAT codes used by companies in Lithuania for i.SAF reporting:

Starting from version **52.4** of the **i.SAF format (LT)** ER configuration, the format includes application-specific parameters where a user must define which **Sales tax codes** in the system correspond to which values from the enumerated list of VAT codes prescript as "Standard VAT codes".

1. To setup application-specific parameters, go to the **Electronic Reporting** workspace, select the **i.SAF format (LT)** format, and then select **Configurations** > **Application specific parameters** > **Setup**.
2. On the Action Pane, on the **Lookups** tab, select **ReportTaxCodesLookup** to view the latest version of the format.
3. On the **Conditions** FastTab, define which **Standard VAT codes** must correspond to which **System Sales tax codes**.

For example, if you have in the system two **System Sales tax codes**, VAT1 and VAT2 which must be reported in one **Standard VAT codes PVM1**, you would need to add the following lines on the **Conditions** FastTab:

| Lookup result | Line | Tax Code |
|---------------|------|----------|
| **PVM1** (the value must be selected from the predefined enumerated list) | 1 | **VAT1** (the value must be selected from the list of values which are entries in the **Sales tax codes** table) |
| **PVM1** (the value must be selected from the predefined enumerated list) | 2 | **VAT2** (the value must be selected from the list of values which are entries in the **Sales tax codes** table) |

The **Line** column is used for the counter which controls the order of execution of the conditions of the lookup field.

4. Add all of the conditions for those “Standard VAT codes” that must be reported for your Legal entity. According to documentation, the list of “Standard VAT codes” is the following:

| **Lookup result** | **Line**              | **Tax Code**      |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **PVM100**        | The last in your list | **\*Not blank\*** |

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to add “PVM100” which must collect data by “other cases” as the last in the list. The **Line** value must be the last in your table. 

This setup means that all the tax transactions for **Sales tax code**, of which there is no specific setup as no “Standard VAT code” is specifically defined for it, will be considered for **PVM100.** It is mandatory to define this lookup result field at the end of the list of your conditions.

You can easily export the setup of application-specific parameters from one version of a report and import it into another version. You can also export the setup from one report and import it into another report, provided that both reports have the same structure of lookup fields.

When you've finished setting up conditions, change the value of the **State** field to **Completed**, save your changes, and close the page.

## Import a package of data entities that include a predefined electronic messaging setup

**Electronic Messages** functionality is provided to maintain different processes of electronic reporting of different document types. For more information about Electronic messages, see [Electronic messaging](../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.md).

The process of setting up the Electronic messages functionality for i.SAF has many steps. Because the names of some predefined entities are used in the ER configurations, it's important that you use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you import setup data from the package of data entities, complete the  to make sure that the data entities in your application are refreshed and synced.

1. In [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2), go to the Shared asset library, and select the **Data package** asset type. 
2. Find **LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip** in the list of data package files, and download it to your computer.
3. After the **LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip** file is downloaded, open Finance, select the company that you will interoperate with HMRC from, and then go to **Workspaces** \> **Data management**.
4. In the **Data management** workspace, go to **Framework parameters** \> **Entity settings**, and then select **Refresh entity list**. Wait for confirmation that the refresh has been completed. For more information about how to refresh the entity list, see [Entity list refresh](../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities.md#entity-list-refresh).
5. Validate that the source data and target data are correctly mapped. For more information, see the section about validation in [Data import and export jobs](../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md#validate-that-the-source-data-and-target-data-are-mapped-correctly).
6. Before the data entities are used for the first time to import the data from the package, sync the mapping of source data and target data. In the list for the package, select a data entity, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Modify target mapping**. 
7. Above the grid for the package, select **Generate mapping** to create a mapping from scratch and then save the mapping.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each data entity in the package before you start the import.

For more information about data management, see [Data management](../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md). 

9. You must now import data from the **LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip** file into the selected company. In the **Data management** workspace, select **Import**, and set the **Source data format** field to **Package**. 
10. Select **Upload and add**, select the **LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip** file on your computer, and upload it.

![Import a package of data entities](media/isaf-data-management.jpg)

You will get a notification in **Messages**, or you can manually refresh the page to see data import progress. When the importing process is complete, you will see the results on **Execution summary** page.

The **LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip** package provides a setup for **"i.SAF"** processing that supports the process of i.SAF reporting composed generaly of three elements:

- **Populate invoices** – Invoices are added to the **Message items** table.
- **Attributes evaluation** – The **Document type** field values are evaluated for all of the invoices added to the **Message items** table.
- **Generate message** – **Electronic message** will be created, and related **Message items** according to their status and criteria setup will be linked to the generated **Electronic message**. The i.SAF report will be generated and attached to the **Electronic message**.

## Set up data sources to collect documents to be reported

**i.SAF** processing lets you collect invoices to be reported in the legal entity. You can then generate an i.SAF report. The collection of invoices is implemented by using the **Populate invoices** action of the **Populate record** type. To correctly collect invoices, you must define a period for the **Populate invoices** action.

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Electronic messages** > **Populate records actions**, and select **Populate invoices**. 

For **i.SAF** processing, default data sources set up includes following three data sources:

 - **VendInvoiceJour:** Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Invoice** \> **Invoice journal**
 - **CustInvoiceJour:** Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Invoice** \> **Invoice journal**
 - **ProjInvoiceJour:** Go to **Project management and accounting** \> **Project invoices** \> **Project invoices**

By default, all records from these data sources will be populated to the **Message items** table when you select **Populate records**.

2. On the **Datasource setup** FastTab, select the **Vendor invoice journal** record, and then select **Edit query**. 
3. For the **Date** field of the **Vendor invoice journal** table, define the period from which vendor invoices from the selected legal entity must be reported in i.SAF format. You can specify other selection criteria here to reflect specific requirements of your company to i.SAF report. 
4. Repeat the same setup for other data sources of the report (Sales invoice journal, Project invoice journal) or delete unnecessary data sources from the list.

![Populate invoices data sources](media/isaf-populate-records.jpg)

## Set up Electronic messaging parameters for i.SAF

After the data entities are imported into the database, complete the following steps and the Electronic Messages functionality will be ready for use.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Executable class settings**, select the **EvaluateInvoiceType_LT** executable class, and on the Action Pane, select **Parameters**. 
2. In the **Invoice type** field, select **InvoiceType** and then click **OK.**
3. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Message processing actions** and set up related GER configurations in the **Format mapping** field for the following actions:

| **Message processing actions name** | **GER configuration** |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Generate message                     | i.SAF format (LT)     |

4. Go to **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters** to set up **Number sequences**:

| **Number sequences reference** | **Number sequences description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Message                        | The unique key for a message. Set up a non-continuous number sequence for this Reference. This number sequence will be used for numbering messages when they are generated. |
| Message item                   | The unique key for a message item. Set up a non-continuous number sequence for this Reference. This number sequence will be used for numbering message items when they are generated from the source tables. |

## Set up security roles for electronic message processing

Different groups of users might require access to **i.SAF** precessing. You can limit access to the processing, based on security groups that are defined in the system.

Complete the following steps to limit access to the **i.SAF** processing.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic message processing**. 
2. Select the **i.SAF** processing, and add the security groups that must work with this processing. If no security group is defined for the processing, only a system admin can see the processing on the **Electronic messages** page.

## Collect data for i.SAF report

The setup of **i.SAF** processing that is provided by using a package of data entites is shown in the following schema.

![i.SAF electronic messaging process](media/isaf-processing.jpg)

The green boxes on the schema show the general process of i.SAF report generation.

1. Got to **Tax** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Electronic messages** > **Electronic message items**, and on the Action Pane, select **Run processing**. 
2. In the **Processing** field, select **i.SAF**. 
3. To start collecting data for the i.SAF report, mark the **Choose action** check box and select **"Populate invoice"**. If you don't mark the **Choose action** check box, when you select **"Populate invoice"** the action will run automaticaly as the first from the selected processing. By selecting **"Populate invoice"**, all the invoices from the data sources defined in the procedure, *Set up data sources to collect documents to be reported* will be generated in **Message items** table according to the criteria defined for these data sources. All of the invoices will be of the same, "Invoice" **Message item type**.
4. On the Action Pane, select **Original document** to review original document of the selected **Message item**.

## Define invoice types for i.SAF reporting

When invoices are successfully populated from data sources to the **Message items** table, the invoice type must be defined for each invoice. **Invoice type** is stored in the **Additional field** group for each invoice. 

1. To define the invoice type, on the Action Pane, select **Run processing**. 
2. In the **Processing** field, select **i.SAF**. 
3. Select the **Choose action** check box and select **"Attrib. evaluation"** to start defining the invoice type, or leave the **Choose action** check box cleared and **"Attrib. evaluation"** action will run automaticaly as the next action from the selected processing. As a result of **"Attrib. evaluation"** action, for all the invoices which have a status of **Populated**, the invoice type will be defined and shown in **Invoice type** field in the **Addtional field** group for each invoice.

![i.SAF Invoice type evaluation](media/isaf-invoice-type.jpg)

## Generate i.SAF report in XML

The i.SAF report must be generated and provided to the Tax Authority in XML format.

1. To generate i.SAF report, go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Message itemss**, and on the Action Pane, select **Generate report**. 
2. Select **i.SAF** in the **Processing** field and then select **"Generate message"** in the **Action** field to generate i.SAF report. 
3. In the **Electronic report parameters** dialog page define the following parameters:

| **Parameter name** | **Description** |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Report type** | Select one of the allowed reporting types:<ul><li> - **F**: The report will include received and issued invoices</li><li> - **S**: The report will include only issued invoices</li><li> - **P**: The report will include only received invoices </li></ul> |
| **From date** | Select the start date of the period for which the i.SAF report must be generated. |
| **To date** | Select the end date of the period for which i.SAF report must be generated. |
| **Settlement period** | Select the **Settlement period** to define tax transactions posted, where the **Settlement period** must be included in the report. |
| **Part number** | Enter the number of the part of the report. |
| **Number of parts** | Enter the number of the parts. |

As a result of the **"Generate message"** action, for all of the invoices with a status of **Evaluated**, an electronic message will be created and shown in **Message** column in relation with each invoice. The **Status** of the messages items included to the report will be changed to **Reported**.
5. To view the file, select the electronic message item, and then select **Attachments** (paper clip icon) in the upper-right corner of the page. 
6. On the **Attachments** page for the selected message, select the last attachment, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Open**.

## Regenerate i.SAF report 

If you must regenerate i.SAF for some message items, select **Update status** on the Action Pane to update the status of the message items to initial status. On the **Update status** dialog page, select **i.SAF** processing and then **Update to initial status**. To reverse an invoice status to the initial status, select one of allowed values, **Populated** or **Evaluated**.

## Exclude or postpone invoice reporting in i.SAF

If you want to exclude an invoice from i.SAF report, select **Update status** on the Action Pane to update the status of the message items to **Excluded**. Invoices with a status of **Excluded** will not the included into the report. On the **Update status** dialog page, select **i.SAF** processing, select **Exclude message item** in the **Action** field,  and then select **Excluded** in the **New status** field. You can define additional criteria using the **Filter** function, and specify which invoice must be excluded from further processing.

![i.SAF Exclude message item from processing](media/isaf-exclude-message-item.jpg)

If you want to postpone reporting of an invoice in i.SAF report, select **Update status** on the Action Pane to update the status of the message items to **Postponed**. Invoices with a status of **Postponed** will not the included into the report. On the **Update status** dialog page, select **i.SAF** processing, select **Update to Postponed** in the **Action** field,  and then select **Postponed** in tje **New status** field. You can define additional criteria by using the **Filter** function, to specify reporting of which invoice(s) must be postponed by criteria.

You can always reverse status of **Excluded** or **Postponed** message items by using the **Update to initial status** action.
