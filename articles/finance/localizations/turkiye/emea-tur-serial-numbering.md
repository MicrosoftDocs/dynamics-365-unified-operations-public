# Use continuous serial numbering of packing slips and invoices

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to use continuous serial numbering for packing slips and invoices for the Republic of Türkiye in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

In the Republic of Türkiye, specific number sequences are required for packing slips and invoices to ensure legal compliance and accurate tracking. To manage and track numbers in a system, you must follow a set of rules for number sequences. These rules ensure that each number is unique, in order, and easy to understand.

You can maintain organized records by using a specific format that includes prefixes, a year, and unique digits. To prevent confusion, you must ensure that the dates that are associated with these numbers are in the correct order.

Many types of documents benefit from this systematic approach to number sequencing. Examples include sales order packing slips, purchase return order product receipts, free text invoices, sales order invoices, purchase return order invoices, vendor invoice journals, customer invoices, and vendor return invoices in general journal entries.

When you use preprinted serial numbers, you must ensure that the posting date maintains chronological consistency. The posting date of each preprinted serial number must always follow the posting date of the previous preprinted serial number. In addition, to prevent the premature use of future dates, it must always precede the posting date of the next preprinted serial number. If there is a conflict with the posting date, a different number sequence should be used. This number sequence should be managed through number sequence groups.

Preprinted serial number configurations are set up through common pages that you can open by using the following paths in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance:

- **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Preprinted serial numbers**
- **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Preprinted serial numbers**

> [!NOTE]
> As the preceding paths show, the **Preprinted serial numbers** setup and parameter pages can be opened from both the **Accounts payable** module and the **Accounts receivable** module. Any changes that you make to the pages in one module are reflected on the pages in the other module.

## Serial numbering requirements

In Türkiye, preprinted serial numbers that are assigned to documents that are sent to customers and vendors must use a serial prefix. Here are the general requirements for serial numbering in Türkiye:

- **Continuous values:** Numbers must be in order, without gaps.
- **Predefined format:** Set the format of the number sequence before you use it.
- **Prefix (three digits):** Numbers must include a three-digit code that identifies the sequence.
- **Year:** Numbers must include the current year in the sequence.
- **Number (nine digits):** Numbers must include a nine-digit number that uniquely identifies each entry.
- **Separators:** Use specific characters to separate the different parts of the sequence.

The **Serial prefix** field on the posting page must be set for invoices and packing slips that are sent to customers, and for return product receipts and return invoices that are sent to vendors. You can manually select the serial prefix when you post the relevant documents to the ledger. Alternatively, the field can be set automatically, based on a predefined parameter.

## Set up a serial number format

This section explains how to define serial number formats for various document types, such as e-archives, e-invoices, and e-packing slips. It provides information about preprinted serial numbers, including details about serial number formats and number sequences.

In Türkiye, serial numbers must be generated in a specific format that complies with regulations. The serial number must be 16 digits long (for example, *AAA2025000000001*), and it must include the following details:

- **Serial prefix:** Three digits (*AAA*)
- **Year:** Four digits (*2025*)
- **Serial number:** Nine digits (*000000001*)

You configure serial number formats on the **Serial number formats** tab of the **Preprinted serial numbers** parameter page (**Accounts payable** or **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Preprinted serial numbers** \> **Parameters**).

The following table describes the fields that you can set on the **Serial number formats** tab.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Format name | Specify the name of the serial format.|
| 1.field name | Select the value that appears in the first part of the serial number format.|
| 1.separator | Specify the characters or symbols that are used to divide the first and second parts of a preprinted serial number. |
| 2.field name | Select the value that appears in the second part of the serial number format.|
| 2.separator | Specify the characters or symbols that are used to divide the second and third parts of a preprinted serial number. |
| 3.field name | Select the value that appears in the third section of the serial number format.|
| 3.separator | Specify the characters or symbols that are used to divide the third and fourth parts of a preprinted serial number.|
| 4.field name | Select the value that appears in the fourth section of the serial number format.|
| 4.separator | Specify the characters or symbols that are used to divide the fourth and fifth parts of a preprinted serial number. |
| 5.field name | Select the value that appears in the fifth section of the serial number format.|
| Format | Specifies how the serial number format is structured based on the selections in each column.|

For the five ***x*.field name** fields (**1.field name**, **2.field name**, …**5.field name**), you can select the following options:

- **Serial prefix** – Select this option to specify that the serial prefix appears in the corresponding part of the serial number format.
- **Fiscal year** – Select this option to specify that the fiscal year appears in the corresponding part of the serial number format.
- **Number** – Select this option to specify that the unique serial number appears in the corresponding part of the serial number format.
- **None** – Select this option to specify that there is no value in the corresponding part of the serial number format.

The serial number format is then formed by sequentially combining the values of the ***x*.field name** and ***x*.separator** fields in the following way:

**1.field name** + **1.separator** + **2.field name** + **2.separator** + **3.field name** + **3.separator** + **4.field name** + **4.separator** + **5.field name**

For example, to generate a 16-digit preprinted serial number (such as *AAA2025000000001*) that complies with legal regulations, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable** or **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Preprinted serial numbers** \> **Parameters**.
1. On the **Serial number formats** tab, select **New**.
1. In the **Format name** field, enter a name.
1. In the **1.field name** field, select **Serial prefix**.
1. Leave the **1.separator** field blank.
1. In the **2.field name** field, select **Fiscal year**.
1. Leave the **2.separator** field blank.
1. In the **3.field name** field, select **Number**.
1. Leave the **3.separator** field blank.
1. In the **4.field name** field, select **None**.
1. Leave the **4.separator** field blank.
1. In the **5.field name** field, select **None**.
1. Select **Save**.

In this case, the serial number format is as follows:

*Serial prefix* + *Fiscal year* + *Number*

## Set up a serial prefix

This section explains how to set up a serial prefix for documents that are sent to customers or vendors. You can define and manage serial prefixes for various document types. The setup is essential for maintaining accurate records and ensuring compliance with regulations, because it ensures that each document type uses a unique and traceable serial number format.

The following table describes the fields that are used to set up a serial prefix.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Serial prefix | Enter a three-digit character set.|
| Number sequence group | Define a number sequence group for each serial prefix to maintain unique number sequences.|
| Serial type | Select the type of document.|
| Fiscal year | Enter the fiscal year. |
| Number of digits | Enter the length of the serial number.|
| Default prefix | Mark a serial prefix as the default. |

> [!NOTE]
> A separate number sequence group must be assigned to each serial prefix. If more than one serial prefix uses the same number sequence group, the integrity of the number series is disrupted.

After you define a serial number format, you should set up a serial prefix for the document type. 

For example, to set up a serial prefix for the document type for the serial number format that you created for a 16-digit preprinted serial number (such as *AAA2025000000001*), follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable** or **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Preprinted serial numbers** \> **Preprinted serial numbers**.
1. In the **Document type** field, select the document type to create the serial prefix for.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Serial prefix** field, enter "AAA" as the three-digit prefix.
1. In the **Number sequence group** field, select the number sequence group that you created for the serial prefix.
1. Select **Save**.
1. In the **Reference** section, select the number sequence code that was created for the number sequence group. To create a number sequence, follow these steps:
    1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Number sequences** \> **Number sequences**.
    1. In the **New** section, select **Number sequence**.
    1. In the **Number sequence code** field, enter a code for the new number sequence.
    1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the number sequence.
    1. On the **Scope parameters** FastTab, in the **Scope** field, select *Company*. Then, in the **Company** field, select your company.
    1. On the **Segments** FastTab, define a single segment where the **Segment** field is set to **Alphanumeric**. In the **Value** field, enter 16 number signs ("\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#").
    1. Select **Save**.
1. In the **Serial type** field, select the relevant serial type.
1. In the **Fiscal year** field, enter "2025".
1. In the **Number of digits** field, enter "9".
1. In the **Serial format** field, select the serial number format that you created.
1. Select the **Default prefix** option if the serial prefix is the default serial prefix.
1. Select **Save**.

Use the **Open**, **Closed**, and **Cancelled** tabs to manage and track the status of preprinted serial numbers for various documents. The following table describes these tabs.

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Open | This tab lists all preprinted serial numbers that are currently active and available for use as they are needed. These serial numbers have been generated, but they haven't yet been assigned to any document. You can change the status of a preprinted serial number from *Open* to *Cancelled* by using the **Cancel** button. |
| Closed | This tab lists preprinted serial numbers that have been assigned to specific documents. These serial numbers are no longer available for new assignments. However, they are retained in the system for record-keeping and tracking purposes. *Closed* status indicates that the preprinted serial number is associated with a document that has been posted to a document. Therefore, you can't change the status of a serial number if it's *Closed*. |
| Cancelled | This tab lists preprinted serial numbers that have been invalidated or voided. These serial numbers aren't available for use and are marked as canceled because of errors, duplicates or other reasons. However, they are retained in the system for audit and compliance purposes. You can change the status of a preprinted serial number from *Cancelled* to *Open* by using the **Open** button. |

> [!NOTE]
> - If an error occurs during the posting process, the system creates the preprinted serial number and assigns *Free* status to it on the **Open** tab. After the errors are fixed, and posting is completed, the system reuses the preprinted serial number and moves it to the **Closed** tab.
> - If the intended posting date is earlier than the date of the last posted document for the same serial prefix, the system prevents the posting and shows an error message. In this case, you must select a different serial prefix and then reattempt the posting.
