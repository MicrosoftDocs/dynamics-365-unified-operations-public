### Define transaction codes for check and promissory note operations

This section explains how to define transaction codes to create a check and promissory note transaction in Finance.

The **Check or promissory note transaction codes** page defines standardized transaction codes for managing checks and promissory notes in Finance. 
These codes represent actions like endorsement, collection, return, protest, or cancellation, and are essential for tracking the legal and financial status of commercial paper. 

Transaction codes are central to managing check and promissory note operations in Turkey. 
Each type of check or promissory note movement, such as receipt, issue, transfer, collection, return, or bounce, is represented by a unique transaction code.

This page lets users configure these codes to support financial and legal processes like automated posting, matching, and categorization. 
These codes are then used in the **Check and promissory note journal** to determine how each document is recorded and processed.

The page is used to:

  - Create codes that represent different types of financial movements for checks and promissory notes.
  - Assign behavior parameters to each code, such as whether it's a receipt, issue, collection, or return.

## Calculate rediscount amount for checks and promissory notes

This section provides an overview of the rediscount calculation logic for checks and promissory notes in Finance.

Rediscounting is a financial adjustment process for post-dated checks and promissory notes that aren't matured at the end of the fiscal period. 
This process reflects the time value of money by rediscounting future receivables or payables to their present value.

In Türkiye, rediscount calculations are typically performed at month-end or year-end for both customer (receivable) and vendor (payable) documents. The system calculates the rediscount amount using three key factors:
  
  - The number of remaining days until maturity
  - The applicable interest rate
  - The nominal value of the document

Automating rediscount journal postings and reversals lets organizations maintain compliant and accurate financial records while reducing manual work. 
Rediscount entries reverse in the next fiscal period, restoring the original document value after fulfilling reporting requirements.

The parameters on the **Check and promissory note rediscount calculation** page are explained in the following table;  

| Field                  | Description                                                                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version ID             | Specifies the version code for the period in which the discount calculation will be performed. |
| Current reference date | Defines the reference date for the discount calculation. The period reference date must be the last day of the month. |
| Next reference date    | Defines the reference date for the next period's discount calculation. The next period reference date must be the first day of the month and can't be before the period reference date. The system records a reverse entry for this date. |
| Exchange rate type     | Specifies the type of currency for foreign currency checks and notes. The value defined in the check-note parameters is used as the default.     |
| Detail level           | Specifies the level of detail for the journal entry when the discount values are posted. The value defined in the check-note parameters is used as the default. |
| Journal name           | Specifies the journal that is used to post the rediscount transaction. |
| Posted                 | Indicates whether the rediscount journal has been successfully posted. |

Follow these steps to create a rediscount calculation:

1. Go to **Cash and bank management**** > ****Inquiries and reports**** > ****Check and promissory note operations**** > ****Check and promissory note rediscount calculation**.
1. Define the interest rate for the relevant period on the **Interest rates** page, then select **Save** and close the page.
