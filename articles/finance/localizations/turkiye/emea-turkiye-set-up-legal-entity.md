# Set up a legal entity for Türkiye

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up a legal entity for a company that's located in Türkiye and is using the features for Türkiye that are available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. A legal entity represents the company, and it contains the tax and legal attributes that are required for the rest of the configuration for Türkiye.

Before you begin, open the **Feature management** workspace, and verify that the **Globalization expansion - Türkiye** feature is enabled. 
If it is not enabled, enable it. After you're sure that the feature is enabled, complete the following procedures.

## Create a legal entity

To create a legal entity, follow this step.

- Go to **Organization administration > Organizations > Legal entities**, create a legal entity, and set the country of the primary address to Türkiye. Some functionality is enabled only for Türkiye. Examples include specific reports or electronic invoices.

## Configure VAT IDs of the legal entity, customers, and vendors

In Türkiye, the Value-added tax (VAT) ID is a 10-digit numeric code assigned by the Revenue Administration (GIB) to individuals and legal entities for use in tax-related transactions. While Turkish citizens may use their Turkish Citizenship Number which is 11-digit for personal tax matters, obtaining a VAT number is mandatory for legal entities (such as companies, associations, and foundations) as well as for individuals engaged in commercial activities.

You can set up the VAT ID of the legal entity and its vendors and customers using the [Registration IDs](../../localizations/europe/emea-registration-ids.md) functionality.

### Configure a registration type for VAT ID

Before you set up the VAT ID of the legal entity and its vendors and customers, you need to configure the registration type for VAT ID by following the steps described in [Set up VAT ID](../../localizations/europe/eur-00015-vat-id.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> When creating a new Registration type, the **Country/Region** value must be set to **TUR** for Türkiye.

You need to configure two distinct registration types for the following party types:

- Organizations
- Persons

To do that, you need to assign distinct names to the registration types, for example:

- "TURVAT_Organization" for organizations.
- "TURVAT_Person" for persons.

In the **Restricted to** field:

- You must select **Organization** for the "TURVAT_Organization" registration type.
- You must select **Person** for the "TURVAT_Person" registration type.

In the **Format** field;

- For TURVAT_Organization, enter 10-digit "##########".
- For TURVAT_Person, enter 11-digit "###########".

Complete setting up the registration type and registration category for VAT ID by following the steps described in [Set up VAT ID](../../localizations/europe/eur-00015-vat-id.md).

### Configure tax offices (Issuing agencies)

In Türkiye, every legal entity, customer, and vendor must be linked to a **tax office** for identification and regulatory reporting.  
In Finance, this information is managed through the **Issuing agencies** set up. When you define tax office names and codes, you ensure that **Registration IDs** are correctly associated with the appropriate tax authority. This setup is essential for generating compliant e-invoice (UBL-TR) documents and other statutory reports.

To define tax offices, follow these steps.  

1. Go to **Organization administration > Global address book > Issuing agencies**.  
1. On the **Issuing agencies** page, select **New**.  
1. In the **Issuing agency** field, enter the numeric tax office code (for example, *34272*).  
1. In the **Description** field, enter the name of the tax office (for example, *Kadıköy vergi dairesi*).  
1. Repeat these steps for all relevant tax offices.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The tax office information entered here is used in e-invoice (UBL-TR) XML files and other legal reports. Incorrect configuration may result in validation errors from GİB (Turkish Revenue Administration).
