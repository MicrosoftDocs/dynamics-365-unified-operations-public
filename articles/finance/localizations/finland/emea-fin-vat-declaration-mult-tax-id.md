# Support for multiple VAT registration numbers in the VAT return of Finland

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

To report a VAT return of Finland from a legal entity that has a primary address outside Finland, we recommend that you use the [Tax Calculation](../global/global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md) service, and that you enable the [Support multiple VAT registration numbers](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md) feature in the **Feature management** workspace. Additionally, set up a VAT registration number in the **Tax registration number** additional field of your **FI VAT declaration** processing in the Electronic messages setup. For more information about how to set up a VAT registration number, see [Set up the VAT registration number of the company that is reporting VAT](emea-fin-vat-declaration.md#vat-id).

For more information about how to set up and generate a VAT declaration of Finland, see [VAT declaration (Finland)](emea-fin-vat-declaration.md).
