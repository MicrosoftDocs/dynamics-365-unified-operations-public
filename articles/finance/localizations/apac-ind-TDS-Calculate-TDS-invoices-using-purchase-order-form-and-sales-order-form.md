This article lists the steps for calculating Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on various types of invoices using the **Purchase order**, **Purchase journal**, **Blanket order**, and **Sales order** pages.

1. Create a purchase order, purchase journal, purchase blanket order, or a sales order using the page listed. Enter the required details.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **TCS group** field isn't available when you select a TDS group in the **TDS group** field. TDS is calculated only if the **Calculate withholding tax** check box is selected for the vendor or customer on the **All vendors** or **All customers** page.

   - **Withholding** **tax** **amount** **in** **total** - The total TDS calculated for the transaction for the TDS group.

   - **Value** - The total percentage used to calculate TDS for the transaction. The total percentage is based on the formula that is defined for TDS tax codes attached to the TDS group.

   - **Adjusted withholding tax amount in total** - The total adjusted TDS amount for all tax codes in the TDS group.

   - **TDS** - If selected, a TDS group is attached to the transaction.

The fields on the **Overview**, **General**, and **Adjustment** tabs on the **Temporary withholding tax transactions** page display the calculated TDS amount and adjusted TDS amount details for each TDS tax code attached to the TDS group.
