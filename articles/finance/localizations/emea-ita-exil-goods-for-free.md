# Tax invoice for goods delivered for free

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to manage goods that were delivered free of charge. The functionality that is available through the **Tax invoice for goods delivered for free** feature lets you generate invoices that include the words "Free invoice." The total of these invoices equals the tax amount only.

To generate these invoices, you must set up delivery reasons that can be used in the sales order.

These invoices can be used in two cases, depending on who pays the taxes on the items:

- Your company pays the sales tax, and the system generates a self-invoice and accounting entries for the payment.
- The customer pays the sales tax.

The delivery reason on the invoice determines which case you use.

## Prerequisites

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.
- In the **Feature management** workspace, turn on the **Tax invoice for goods delivered for free** feature. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Set up the summary update parameters

You can set up the summary update parameters only if a delivery reason is available for both the packing slip and the invoice.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.
2. On the **Summary update** tab, select **Summary update parameters**.
3. The **Delivery reason** summary update parameter must be selected for both packing slips and invoices. On the **Invoice** tab, in the **Available** list, select **Delivery reason**. Then select the right arrow button to move **Delivery reason** to the **Selected** list. Repeat this step on the **Packing slip** tab.

Miscellaneous charges aren't always required or wanted when free sales invoices are issued. Follow these steps to exclude miscellaneous charges when they are automatically generated.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Charges setup** \> **Charges code**.
2. Create or select an existing charges code.
2. Set the **Exclude charge in free invoices** option to **Yes**.

2. Select the **Goods for free** check box.
3. In the **Invoice account** field, select the customer account that represents your company.
4. In the **Terms of payment** field, specify cash terms of payment.

> [!NOTE]
> The company issues a self-invoice to account for required taxes for goods that are delivered for free. In addition to the invoice posting, the accounting entries for the payment must be generated. To make that process available, you must have a customer account that represents your company. In this case, the invoice account on a sales order will be set to the company customer account by default. Therefore, the invoice that is issued will be a self-invoice. When you specify cash term of payments, the payment occurs in addition to the self-invoice. Finally, the customer transaction is closed, and the amount is posted to the cash account that is specified in the **Terms of payment** field. This field will be also set by default on a sales order header.
>
> If your customer pays the taxes, the **Invoice account** and **Terms of payment** fields must be left blank.

## Posting tax invoices for goods delivered for free

When you create a sales order for goods that are delivered for free, the specified delivery reason determines whether a self-invoice is generated for your company, or whether an invoice is generated for your customer. If you use cash terms of payment, payment accounting entries will also be created when you post the sales invoice.

## Printing tax invoices for goods delivered for free

The invoice printout will show the title **Free invoice**. Additionally, items will be prefixed with **Free item:** if the **Goods for free** flag is active on the delivery reason that is used for the order.
