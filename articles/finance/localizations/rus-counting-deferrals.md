# Deferrals counting (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The deferrals functionality supports the process of deferrals counting and lets you print the **Inventory act (INV-11)** report.

Before you generate the **Inventory act (INV-11)** report, you must create deferrals and post writing-off transactions in the deferrals journal.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Deferrals** \> **Deferrals counting journal**.

    You can use the **Deferrals counting journal** page to create a Deferrals counting journal and print the **Inventory act (INV-11)** report.

    The following table describes the tabs on the **Deferrals counting journal** page.

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Tab</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>Overview</td>
    <td>Create a new Deferrals counting journal.
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can't create more than one journal that has the same counting date.</p>
