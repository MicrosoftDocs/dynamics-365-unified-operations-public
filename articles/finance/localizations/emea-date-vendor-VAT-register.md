# Date of vendor VAT register

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.24, a new **Date of vendor VAT register** field is available for vendor invoices. This field specifies the date of the taxable supply for a purchase.

To enable the new field, go to the **Feature management** workspace, find and select the **Enable date of vendor VAT register on vendor invoices** feature, and then select **Enable now**.

Incoming invoices from your suppliers can have two dates: the date when the vendor issued the invoice and the date of the taxable supply (that is, the date when the vendor charged the value-added tax [VAT] payable). In some scenarios, these two dates might differ.

You can deduct the incoming VAT amount for a purchase invoice and include that invoice on VAT reports later, on a date that differs from both the previously mentioned dates. This date is controlled by local legislation rules about postponed incoming VAT deduction for some scenarios. It varies by country or region.

Some VAT reports, such as the [VAT Control statement report](emea-cze-vat-declaration-tax-declaration-model.md#vat-control-statement) in the Czech Republic, require that the date of the taxable supply be reported for a purchase document. This date must be reported so that the tax authorities can reconcile the VAT reporting between counterparties.

In Finance, you can define dates in the following fields:

- **Invoice date** – The date when the invoice was issued by the supplier.
- **Date of VAT register** – The date of the VAT amount deduction for the purchase invoice.
- **Date of vendor VAT register** – The date of the taxable supply of the vendor.
- **Receive document date** – The date when you received the invoice.

These fields are included on the following pages:

- Vendor invoice
- Vendor invoice register
- Vendor invoice approval
- Vendor invoice journal

After the vendor invoice is posted, you can review the dates on the **Invoice journal** and **Vendor transactions** pages.
