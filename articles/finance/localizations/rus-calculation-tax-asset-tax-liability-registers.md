# Calculation of tax asset and tax liability registers

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to Russian legislation, the accounting profit and the profit tax base are formed according to different legislation and rules. Therefore, two tax types have been developed:

- **Constant tax**: Differences are based on income and expenses that form the accounting profit (loss) and are excluded from the calculation of the tax base for income tax. Constant tax differences generate constant tax income (CTI) and constant tax expense (CTE).
- **Temporary tax**: Differences are based on deferred income tax. The tax is from when expenses or income that form the accounting profit are in one reporting period, and the tax base is in another reporting period or in other reporting periods. Temporary tax differences generate deferred tax asset (DTA) and deferred tax liability (DTL).

This article provides information about the two methods that tax registers use to calculate tax differences:

- Balance method:
    - **Calculation of temporary tax differences by balance method** tax register
    - **Calculation of constant tax differences by balance method** tax register

- Accrual method:
    - **Calculation of temporary tax differences** tax register
    - **Calculation of constant tax differences** tax register
   
> [!NOTE]
> As of January 1, 2020, tax differences must be calculated by using the balance method.

## Turn on the feature

1. In the **Feature management** workspace, find and select the feature that is named **Tax differences registers by balance method**.
2. Select **Enable now**.

## Set up journal voucher creation for tax differences

Before you create a journal voucher for tax differences in the system, you must complete the following setup procedures.

1. [Set up General ledger parameters](#parameters).
2. [Set up a journal for ledger posting of tax differences by using the balance method](#method).
3. [Set up ledger accounts for deferred taxes](#taxes).
4. [Set up a sales tax code for profit tax](#profit).
5. [Set up a sales tax code for temporary tax differences that are based on deferrals](#deferrals).
6. [Set up tax registers](#registers).
7. [Set up tax difference registers](#difference).

### <a name="parameters">Set up General ledger parameters</a>

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Parameters** > **General ledger parameters**.
2. On the **Profit tax** tab, in the **Compression** field, specify the level of detail that transactions for tax differences should have:

    - **Active and liability**: Generate a uniform transaction for each operation for each object. Operations include formation, repayment, and write-off.
    - **Expense and income**: Generate a uniform transaction for each operation for all objects that have the same expense/income code.
    - **Tax**: Generate a uniform transaction for each operation for all objects that have the same sales tax code.
    - **Total**: Generate a uniform transaction for each operation for all objects.

### <a name="method">Set up a journal for ledger posting of tax differences that are calculated by using the balance method</a>

1. Go to **General ledger** > **Journal setup** > **Journal names**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter **Tax differences by balance method**.
4. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the journal.

    - If you calculate that current profit tax based on the profit tax declaration (tax accounting data), enter a ledger account from group of accounts **99** for tax differences.

   > [!NOTE]
   > According to the methodological recommendations for applying the new PBU18 accounting standard, as of January 1, 2020, companies have a choice about how they calculate the current profit tax. The calculation can be based on either accounting data or the profit tax declaration.
   > 
   > - When the current profit tax is calculated based on accounting data, the ledger posting of temporary deferred tax should be posted in correspondence with ledger  account **68.profit tax**. In this case, the ledger posting of constant tax differences should be posted in correspondence with ledger account **68.profit tax**.
   > - When the current profit tax is calculated based on the profit tax declaration, the ledger posting of temporary deferred tax should be posted in correspondence with  ledger account **99**. In this case, there is ledger posting of constant tax differences.
   > 
   > The company should make a make a note of their choice in the accounting policy.

### Tax registers for the calculation of constant tax differences

The **Calculation of constant tax differences by balance method** and **Calculation of constant tax differences** tax registers reflect information about the constant difference that is determined based on the amount of expenses and the rated amount for expenses of this type.
The **Calculation of constant tax differences by balance method** tax register has the following sources of information:

   - The **Incomes and expenses that do not influence the tax base** tax register.
   - The **Standard expenses in current period** tax register. For more information, see [Rated expenses registers](rus-rated-expenses-registers.md).

Unlike the **Calculation of constant tax differences by balance method** tax register, the **Calculation of constant tax differences** tax register isn't based on the following tax registers:

   - Restoring of depreciation bonus
   - Reserves for bad debts

The tax registers differ because, as of January 1, 2020, these assets form temporary tax differences.
The following illustration show an example of the **Calculation of constant tax differences by balance method** tax register.

## Create a journal voucher for tax differences

1. Go to **Tax** > **Journal entries** > **Tax register journal**.
2. Select the line for the period where the **Calculation of temporary tax differences by balance method** and **Calculation of constant tax differences by balance method** tax registers are calculated and approved.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Ledger journal** > **Tax differences by balance method**.
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > On the **Ledger journal** menu, the **Tax differences** command generates the tax difference amounts that are calculated in the **Calculation of temporary tax differences** and **Calculation of constant tax differences** tax registers. If you generate a ledger journal that has transactions for tax differences of one type, such as accrual method or balance method, the second menu item becomes unavailable. In other words, you can't simultaneously use the old and new methods to create a ledger posting for tax differences.

4. On the Action Pane, select **Create** > **Create journal**. The journal is created, and its lines include the vouchers for the tax difference of the current period.
5. On the Action Pane, select **Lines** to view the vouchers and other details.
