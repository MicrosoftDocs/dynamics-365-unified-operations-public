# Set up customs clearance

This article explains how to set up the registration information that reflects the customs clearance process for products that are transported across the border of the Russian Federation. The customs clearance process includes the following tasks:

- Calculate customs payments. These payments include import and export customs fees, customs duties, value-added tax (VAT), and excise tax that is collected on products that are imported into the customs territory of the Russian Federation.
- Reflect the fact that the customs authorities have issued the cargo customs declaration (GTD) and the adjustment of the customs value (KTS).
- Generate postings for debts to customs or a customs broker, based on the amount of customs payments.
- Adjust the cost of imported products, based on the amount of customs duties and fees.
- Write off duties and fees for expenses.

## Set up the statistical value currency and number sequences

1. Go to **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Inventory and warehouse management parameters**.
2. On the **General** tab, in the **Customs declaration** section, in the **Currency of statistical value** field, select a currency code for the statistical value that reflects the totals for customs payments. For example, select **USD**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you leave the **Currency of statistical value** field blank, the main currency of the company will be used as the currency of the statistical value. This currency is listed on the **Section overview** page.

3. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.
4. On the **Number sequences** tab, set number sequences for customs journals, KTS numbers, and operations for posting GTD and KTS.

### Set up sales tax codes

Follow these steps to set up a sales tax code that can be used to automatically calculate customs payments.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Indirect taxes** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax codes**.
2. Create and set up a sales tax code. For more information, see [Set up sales tax codes](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-codes.md).
3. In the **Type of tax** field, select **Customs duty** or **Customs fee**.
4. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Ledger posting group** field, select the ledger posting group that you created earlier.
5. If you selected **Customs fee** in the **Type of tax** field, follow these steps:

       ![Settings on the General FastTab of the Sales tax codes page for a sales tax code of the Customs fee tax type.](media/set-up-customs-clearance-04.png)

    –or–

    If you selected **Customs duty** in the **Type of tax** field, follow these steps:

    1. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Complex rate** field, select the complex rate value that is applied to the customs duty:

        - If you leave this field blank, the complex rate value is an *ad valorem* duty and is calculated as a percentage of the customs value of the products. In this case, the distribution of the duty on the lines in the section of the customs journal is proportional to the value.
        - If you select **Maximum**, the rate is determined by comparing the calculated value of the customs duty (from the customs value) with the result of the formula *K* = (*r* &times; *m*) &divide; *q*, where *r* is the value of the **Amount rate** field, *m* is the quantity, weight, or volume in the customs journal, based on the **Method of duty calculation** field, and *q* is the value of the **Calculated quantity** field. The larger of the two values is used as the duty value. In this case, the distribution of the duty on the lines in the section of the customs journal is based on the value of the **Method of duty calculation** field.
        - If you select **Summation**, the calculated value of the customs duty (from the customs value) is added to the result of the formula *K* = (*r* &times; *m*) &divide; *q*, where *r* is the value of the **Amount rate** field, *m* is the quantity, weight, or volume in the customs journal, based on the **Method of duty calculation** field, and *q* is the value of the **Calculated quantity** field. In this case, the distribution of the duty on the lines in the section of the customs journal is proportional to the value.

    2. If you selected a value in the **Complex rate** field, set the following fields:

        - In the **Method of duty calculation** field, select the method that is used to calculate the customs duty.
        - In the **Unit** field, select the unit of measurement that the value of the **Amount rate** field is measured in.

## Set up the terms of delivery for customs clearance of products

Follow these steps to set up the terms of delivery for the customs clearance of imported products. These terms of delivery determine the time of the transfer of ownership and the overhead expenses.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Terms of delivery**.

    –or–

    Go to **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Distribution** \> **Terms of delivery**.

    –or–

    Go to **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Distribution** \> **Terms of delivery**.

2. Create and set up a set of terms of delivery.
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Receipt transactions status** field, select the status of the receipt transactions that are included in the customs journal of import:

    - **Purchased** – The products in transit are purchased. The transfer of ownership occurs before the products cross the customs border.
    - **On order** – The products in transit are ordered but not purchased. The transfer of ownership occurs after the products cross the customs border.

4. In the **Inventory profile** field, select the inventory profile that is used for inventory transactions after the customs cargo declaration is issued. This field is available only if you selected **Purchased** in the **Receipt transactions status** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The inventory profile must have a **Basic** activity.

5. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

    ![Terms of delivery page.](media/set-up-customs-clearance-06.png)

## Set up a charges code for customs payments

For imported purchases, if the transfer of ownership occurred after the customs clearance process, the amounts of customs duties and fees adjust the purchase amount. The invoice lines for duties and fees are automatically created when the customs journal or KTS journal is posted.

If the transfer of ownership occurred before the products crossed the customs border, the change in the cost of receipt is made by correcting the overhead expenses for the purchase order invoice when the customs journal or KTS journal is posted.

The cost adjustment is made if the **Include to the cost** option is set to **Yes** on the customs journal header or in the KTS journal. Otherwise, the amount of fees and duties will be charged as expenses to the account that is set up in the posting group of the corresponding tax code.

Follow these steps to set up a charges code that is used to calculate customs payments for import and export operations.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Charges** **setup** \> **Charges code**.
2. Create and set up a charges code. For more information, see [Create charges codes](/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/create-charges-codes).
3. In the **Customs payment type** field, select the type of customs payment to establish compliance with the overhead expense.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Charges codes where the **Customs payment type** field is set aren't available for manual selection when you create a purchase order.

4. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Debit** section, in the **Type** field, select **Item**. Alternatively, in the **Credit** section, in the **Type** field, select **Ledger account**.
5. In the **Credit** section, set the following fields:

    - In the **Posting** field, select the appropriate posting type. For example, select **Purchase charges duty** for duty.
    - In the **Account** field, select the account that is used as a transit account if the transfer of ownership occurs after the customs clearance process. In this case, the invoice is posted in two iterations: it's posted to the transit account when the customs journal or KTS journal is posted, and it's posted to the nomenclature account when the purchase order invoice is posted.

6. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

    ![Charges codes page.](media/set-up-customs-clearance-07.png)

## Assign a charges code to terms of delivery

Follow these steps to relate the terms of delivery to overhead expenses that increase the transaction amount (the cost of imported products).

    > [!NOTE]
    > After the customs journal is processed, you can't distribute expenses to customs journal purchase lines or invoice overhead expense lines where the delivery condition corresponds to the delivery conditions on the customs journal header. This restriction exists because those overhead expenses affect the basis for calculating customs payments.
