# Advanced notes management

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Advanced notes management feature lets you set up predefined notes that apply to all or specific customers, vendors, and products. You can then add these notes to specific business documents.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the setup, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The **Advanced notes management** feature must be turned on in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Advanced notes setup

If similar notes must be printed on documents for groups of customers, you can define new groups specifically for advanced notes. 

### Define group codes and descriptions

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Advanced notes** \> **Customers advanced notes groups**.

## Advanced notes processing

### Generating advanced notes

In Accounts receivable, the notes for confirmations, picking lists, packing slips, and invoices are automatically generated as attachments to the sales orders that are generated for selected customers and products.

The notes for quotations and free text invoices are automatically generated in the appropriate documents.

In Accounts payable, notes are automatically generated as attachments to new purchase orders for applicable vendors and products.

### Printing advanced notes

Advanced notes which are defined as **External** are printed in the related business documents depending on the settings on the **Form setup**
