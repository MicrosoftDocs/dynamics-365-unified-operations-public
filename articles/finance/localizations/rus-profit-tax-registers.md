# Create tax registers and the tax register journal

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)] 

To organize the accounting of profit for an organization in Russia, a system that consists of a list of tax registers is recommended. The tax registers track the types of income and expenses for the organization, from the time when primary documents (invoices and factures) are calculated until the time when the cost price of finished products is calculated. The data in the tax registers is used to confirm the declared amount of the organization's profit.

The following modules are the data sources for tax registers:

- **Fixed assets (Russia)**
- **Inventory management**
- **Production control**
- **General ledger**
- **Accounts payable**
- **Accounts receivable**

The following types of tax registers exist:

- **First-level tax registers, or "operations" tax registers**: These registers are generated based on operations (transactions) in the system.
- **Second-level tax registers**: These registers use the results of the first-level ("operations") tax registers.
- **Resulting tax registers**: These registers use data from the second-level tax registers.

The data structure of every tax register is almost unique.

Register calculation results are related by the **Expense and income code** value.

In the system, tax registers are grouped according to the information that is shown in them:

- **Tax registers of intermediate calculations**: These tax registers show and store the results of intermediate calculations. Data from these tax registers doesn't have corresponding lines in the tax declaration. The results are used to calculate resulting tax registers.
- **Tax registers of the tax accounting object status**: These tax registers show information about the status of tax accounting objects for each reporting date, and changes in that status.
- **Tax registers for generating reporting data**: These tax registers show values that can be transferred to specific tax declaration lines.

## Available tax registers

The following table shows the full list of available tax registers, grouped by tax register type.

## Create a tax register

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Profit tax** > **Registers**.
2. Select **New** to create a tax register, and set the following fields:

    - **Register type**: Select the tax register type.
    - **Register code**: Enter the unique tax register code.
    - **Period types**: Select how often tax registers are created.

3. On the **Hide** FastTab, move the fields that you want to hide from the **Available fields** column to the **Selected fields** column, and then select the **Hide** checkbox for those fields.

    When new tax register journal lines are created, the fields that you hide are automatically excluded from the tax register.
    The list of fields that are included in the calculation for each tax register can be adjusted on the tax register lines.
    If the list of hidden fields is changed, the fields will be saved for all data that was created before those changes were made.

4. On the **Parameters** FastTab, you can set up additional parameters for the tax register. On the line for each parameter, specify a value in the **Value** field. The parameters are different for every register. For more information about parameters, see the article for each tax register.

### Set up expense and income codes for the tax register

For some tax registers, you must determine which expense and income codes form the information in the tax register.

1. On the **Tax registers** page, in the left pane, select a tax register. Then, on the Action Pane, select **Expense codes** to set up expense and income codes for the tax register.
2. On the **Expense code setup** page, in the left pane, select an expense or income code, or create a new line.
3. In the **Expense code** field, select the expense or income code that is used for the account entries that should be transferred to the tax register.
4. In the **Condition name** field, enter the name of the expense code.
5. On the **Setup** FastTab, set the **Type** option and the **Fixed assets type** field. For more information, see [Fixed assets and intangible assets registers](rus-assets-tax-registers.md).

### View the tax registers tree

1. On the **Tax registers** page, in the left pane, select a tax register. 
2. On the Action Pane, select **Tree** to view the structure of the tax register tree.

    Here is an example of a tree structure for tax registers:

            - Warehoused items
        - **FA/IA sale**
            - FA – information about object

The tree structure shows that some tax registers are calculated by using information from other tax registers. Bold text indicates tax registers that exist in the system and are configured on the **Tax registers** page. Regular text indicates tax registers that exist in the system but aren't configured for calculation on the **Tax registers** page.

## Create and work with a tax register journal

### Create a tax register journal

A new journal can be created only if all journals for previous periods have been approved.
