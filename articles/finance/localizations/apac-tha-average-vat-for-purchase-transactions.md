# Average VAT for purchase transactions

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An individual or legal entity might purchase goods or services that are
used by both value-added tax (VAT) businesses and non-VAT businesses. In
these cases, if there is no clear division of the proportion of the
purchase VAT amount between the different businesses, the purchase VAT
must be divided based on the actual usage of the purchased goods or
services in each business. The average VAT is the percentage of VAT that
is divided between the VAT businesses and the non-VAT businesses of a
legal entity. Average VAT is applied only to purchase transactions.

You can use multiple tax rates to manage the proportion of VAT between
the VAT businesses and the non-VAT businesses of a legal entity. You can
manage average VAT for a sales tax code by using the **Sales tax code
values** page.

## Set up average VAT

1.  Go to **Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Parameters &gt; General ledger
    parameters &gt; Sales tax**, and enable **Manage realized and
    unrealized VAT**.

2.  In the **Calculation method** field, select **Total**.

3.  Go to **Tax &gt; Indirect taxes &gt; Sales tax &gt; Sales tax
    codes**, and set up sales tax codes for average realized VAT.

    1.  In the **Tax type** field, select **Average realized**.

    2.  In the **Ledger posting group** field, select the ledger posting
        group for realized VAT.

    3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Sales tax code** tab, in the
 **Sales tax code** group, select **Values**.

    4.  On the **Sales tax code values** page, in the **Nondeductible
        %** field, enter the percentage of VAT for the non-VAT
        businesses.

    5.  In the **From date** and **To date** fields, define the date
        interval for the proportion.

4.  Go to **Tax &gt; Indirect taxes &gt; Sales tax &gt; Sales tax
    codes**, and set up sales tax codes for average unrealized VAT.

    1.  In the **Tax type** field, select **Average unrealized**.

    2.  In the **Ledger posting group** field, select the ledger posting
        group for unrealized VAT.

    3.  In the **Payment sales tax code** field, select the code for
        average realized VAT.

    4.  On the Action Pane, on the **Sales tax code** tab, in the
 **Sales tax code** group, select **Values**.

    5.  On the **Sales tax code values** page, in the **Nondeductible
        %** field, enter the percentage of VAT for the non-VAT
        businesses.

    6.  In the **From date** and **To date** fields, define the date
        interval for the proportion.

For more information, see [Thailand unrealized and realized VAT](apac-tha-unrealized-vat.md)
and [Set up sales tax codes](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-codes.md).

5.  Go to **Tax &gt; Indirect taxes &gt; Sales tax &gt; Sales tax
    groups**, and set up sales tax groups for average unrealized VAT and
    average realized VAT. For example, for average realized VAT, create
    an item sales tax group that is named **AVAT**. For average
    unrealized VAT, create an item sales tax group that is named
 **AUVAT**.

6.  Go to **Tax &gt; Indirect taxes &gt; Sales tax &gt; Item sales tax
    groups**, and set up item sales tax groups for average unrealized
    VAT and average realized VAT. For example, for average realized VAT,
    create an item sales tax group that is named **AItem**. For average
    unrealized VAT, create an item sales tax group that is named
 **AServ**.

## Work with average VAT

You can create the following transactions that have average unrealized
and realized VAT:

-   Purchase order for goods

-   Purchase order for services

-   Vendor invoice journal

The amount of VAT for the VAT businesses and the non-VAT businesses is
calculated based on the specified VAT ratio. When you post a purchase
order, the VAT for the VAT businesses is posted to either the unrealized
purchase VAT account or the realized purchase VAT account. The VAT for
the non-VAT businesses is posted either to the inventory account for an
item as part of the inventory amount or to the expense account for a
service as part of the expense.

For more information about unrealized and realized VAT, see [Tax invoice
for Thailand](apac-tha-tax-invoices.md).

### Post a vendor payment transaction when the VAT ratio is updated after the invoice is posted

You must manually calculate the VAT ratio every year. When the VAT ratio
is changed, you must update the VAT ratio and the date range. To update
the VAT ratio and date range for a sales tax code after the invoice that
the sales tax code applies to is posted, use the **Sales tax code**
page.

If realized purchase VAT was posted when you posted the invoice, you can
use the updated VAT ratio to make a payment for the vendor transaction
on the **Journal voucher** page. The VAT adjustment is automatically
posted for the realized purchase VAT, based on the updated VAT ratio.

If unrealized VAT was posted when you posted the invoice, when you
receive the tax invoice from the vendor, you can reverse the unrealized
VAT and post the realized VAT by using the **Reversal journal** page.

For more information, see [Reverse the posted unrealized purchase
VAT](./apac-tha-unrealized-vat.md#reverse-the-unrealized-purchase-vat).

If the VAT ratio is updated for an advance payment transaction after you
post the invoice, you can manage the average VAT adjustment for the
transaction. When you receive the tax invoice from the vendor, determine
whether the VAT ratio is updated, reverse the advanced payment, and then
make a payment in the current year. The realized or unrealized VAT will
automatically be adjusted for the original transaction.

#### Example

A 7-percent VAT sales tax code is applicable to a purchase transaction
of 100.00 Thai baht (THB 100.00). When the invoice is posted, the VAT
ratio between the VAT businesses and the non-VAT businesses is 45
percent to 55 percent. However, in the new year, the VAT ratio between
the VAT businesses and the non-VAT businesses is updated to 50 percent
to 50 percent. Therefore, when the invoice is settled, the VAT ratio
between the VAT businesses and the non-VAT businesses is 50 percent to
50 percent.

The VAT is calculated and posted to different accounts, as shown in the
following table.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
