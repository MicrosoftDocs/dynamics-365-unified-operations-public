# Client-Bank interface and reconciliation procedure

This article provides information about user settings for exporting electronic outgoing payments that are created in the payment journals by using the Client-Bank system. You can use the Client-Bank interface to automatically reconcile bank payments and statement data instead of doing a manual reconciliation. Payment formats for a specific bank are customized by using Electronic reporting (ER) configurations.

## Setup

### Import configurations

Before you start to use the Client-Bank functionality, import ER configurations from the Global repository of the Configuration service.

1. In the Global repository, import the following configurations:

    - Payment model mapping 1611
    - Payment model mapping to destination RU
    - Bank statement (RU)
    - Payment order (RU)

    For more information, see [Import configurations from GR](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).

2. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
3. In the **Configurations** section, select **Reporting configurations**.
4. On the Action Pane, select **Edit**.
5. In the navigation list, in the **Payment model** section, set the main payment model as the default payment model. For example, select **Payment model mapping 1611**.
6. On the **Configurations** page, set the **Default for model mapping** option to **Yes**.
7. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

### Set up kinds of documents

1. Go to **Cash and bank management** \> **Setup** \> **Payment order setup** \> **Kinds of document**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New**.

### Set up the exchange interface

The Client-Bank functionality uses text format for export payments. You can customize the electronic format. For more information, see [Formula designer in Electronic reporting (ER)](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting-formula-designer.md).

By default, all downloaded payments are stored in the **Downloads** folder. For information about how to select a different location, see [Electronic reporting (ER) destinations](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-destinations.md).

## Operations in the Client-Bank functionality for export

### Create outgoing payments before export

Outgoing payments can be payments to vendors, or the purchase, sale, or transfer of currency and cash-bank operations.

To create and set up outgoing payments, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Payments** \> **Vendor payment journal** for payments to vendors.
2. Create and set up **Vendor payment journal**. For more information, see [Set up and process payment orders for Russia](rus-payment-order-settings-processing.md#create-payment-order-lines).
3. On the Action Pane, select **Lines**.
4. On the **List** tab, set the following fields:
