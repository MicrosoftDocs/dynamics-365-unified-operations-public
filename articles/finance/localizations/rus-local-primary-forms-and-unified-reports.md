## Cash counting statement (INV-15) report

The **Cash counting statement (INV-15)** report is used for the cash counting act. You might want to generate and print the inventory counting act in the following situations:

-  A single petty cash account includes different currencies.
-  A single cash account includes different asset types, such as **Cash**, **Stamps**, or **Securities**.

Before you generate the cash counting act, calculate the exchange rate adjustment. Then follow these steps.

1. Go to **Cash and bank management \> Inquiries and reports \> Cash reports \> Cash counting statement report**.
2. In the upper part of the **Cash counting statement (INV – 15)** page, follow these steps:
    
      a. In the **Cash** field, select the cash account to count.  
     
      b. In the **Document number** field, specify the number of the document that the inventory that is done should be based on.
      
      c. In the **Counting date** field, specify the date of counting.
      
      d. Set the **Print cash account name** option to **Yes**.
      
      e. Set the **Supplement** option to **Yes** to create the supplement to the counting act.
            
If the cash account allows for accounting in different currencies, the **More currencies** option is set to **Yes**.

3. The lower part of the page shows the lines where calculated data about cash is available. You can also manually create lines. This part of the page includes the following fields:

    - **Asset type** – By default, this field is set to **Cash**. To add a line that uses a different asset type, select **New**. When you create a new line, you can select one of the following values: **Cash**, **Stamps**, **Securities**, or **Other**.
    - **Text** – Specify the asset type. This field is available only if you select **Other** in the **Asset type** field.
    - **Currency** – The currency for the selected asset type.
    - **Counted amount (currency)** – The balance of the specified asset type in the specified currency. You can edit this field.
    - **Posted amount (currency)** – Enter the posted amount, based on the results of the inventory.
    - **Exchange rate** – The exchange rate of the specified currency on the counting date.
    - **Counted amount** – The balance of the specified asset type in the company's primary currency.
    - **Posted amount** – The amount that is specified in the **Posted amount (currency)** field, in the company's primary currency.
    - **Exchange rate adjustment amount** – If the exchange rate adjustments for the specified currency were calculated on the date of inventory, this field is flagged. For the primary currency, the **Exchange rate adjustment amount** field is always flagged.
