# What's new or changed for APAC India GST Localization in 10.0.09 (April 2020) 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic includes a summary of the new features and critical bug fixes released in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.09 for APAC India GST localization.

## New features
### Charge allocation in sales order  
You can now include charge allocations on all sales order lines. To enable this feature, go to the **Feature management** workspace and enable the feature, **Charges allocation on a sales order**.

On the sales order header, you can select **Assessable value** on the charge line. Based on this selection, the distributed charge value is added to line item taxable value. The taxes are then calculated accordingly.

### Default a customer business address on tax information 

This feature will default a customer's business address on the **Tax information** tab of a sales transaction, and the company address
on the **Tax information** tab of a direct delivery purchase order. To enable this feature, go to the **Feature management** workspace, and enable the feature, **Defaulting of customer business address in the tax information tab**.

By using direct delivery functionality, you can create deliveries directly from vendors to customers, reducing delivery time and order administration. During direct delivery, when a purchase order is created, the customer delivery address defaults from the **Sales order** page. However from the GST prospective, the customer's business address should default in tax information. 

### New GSTR return offline tool (trial version) for India in Dynamics 365 Finance 

Under a new GSTR return process, GST ANX-1 (Annexure of supplies) and GST ANX-2 (Annexure of Inward Supplies) will be filed as part of FORM GST RET-1 (Normal) returns. You can generate multiple GSTR returns.

For more information about the GSTR Return offline tool report, see the KB article, [New GSTR Return offline tool (Trial Version Prototype) for India in Dynamics 365 Finance](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4549665). 

### GTE debug mode
Sometimes tax can't be calculated or posted properly after you extend the GST configuration. If you change the data model,
there may be discrepancies between the inputs from Dynamics 365 Finance and the GTE. If you update posting profiles, 
you might encounter posting imbalance issues. It can be time consuming to troubleshoot these issues.

With debug mode enabled, the system will generate a log file that contains the discrepancies between the input fields from Dynamics 365 Finance and the GTE, and the posting profile. 

1. In the internet address bar, change **&debug=vs%2CconfirmExit&** to your Dynamics 365 Finance AOS URL and press Enter to open a new session.

2. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Tax configuration** > **Tax setup** and mark the **Check model mapping discrepancies** parameter.

3. Calculate the tax for the transaction, and then select **Save** to save the **GTETroubleshotingLog.txt** file.

4. Submit the file to Microsoft for investigation.
