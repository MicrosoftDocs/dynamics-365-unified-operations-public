# Get started with electronic invoicing for Indonesia

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article will help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Indonesia. The article provides the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in the Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) and Dynamics 365 Finance. You'll be guided through the steps you must follow in Finance to export sales invoices through the service, and to review the processing results and the status of invoices.

## Prerequisites

Before you use the invoicing functionality, the following prerequisites must be met:

- [Configure the Electronic invoicing solution in Dataverse](e-invoicing-power-platform-plug-in.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Electronic Invoicing connector for Microsoft Dataverse](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-crm/mscrm.electronic-invoicing) isn't currently available from AppSource. If this connector is required to obtain the Dataverse solution for Electronic invoicing, send a request to <DataverseEnvoicing@microsoft.com> to get the Dataverse solution. For general questions about electronic invoicing, go to the dedicated Yammer group, [Electronic invoicing](https://www.yammer.com/dynamicsaxfeedbackprograms/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=9386819584&view=all). If you need further assistance, create a support ticket. For more information about support tickets, see [Get support for finance and operations apps or Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-support.md).

- Follow the steps in the article,[Get started with Electronic invoicing](e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

### Set up RCS

During RCS setup, complete the following tasks.

1. Enable the **Electronic reporting Microsoft Dataverse datasources support** feature in the **Feature management** workspace.
2. Import the Electronic Invoicing feature to process invoice exports and importing vendor invoices.
3. Review the format configurations that are required to generate and export sales invoices.
4. Review or configure the actions in the processing pipeline that support the sales invoice export and import scenarios.
5. Publish the Electronic Invoicing feature for export sales invoices, and import vendor invoices.
6. Import the **Invoices communication Dataverse mapping** configuration.
7. Create a connected application to Dataverse.

#### Import the Electronic Invoicing feature

1. Sign in to your RCS account.
2. In the **Globalization features** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **Electronic Invoicing** tile.
3. On the **Electronic Invoicing features** page, select **Import** to import, from the Global repository, the **Indonesian electronic invoice (ID)** feature that is published by the Microsoft configuration provider.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the feature in the list, select **Synchronize**, and then repeat step 3.

When you import the **Indonesian electronic invoice (ID)** feature from the Global repository, all the feature settings are imported. These settings include the configurations and actions of the processing pipeline.

#### Create a new version of the Indonesian electronic invoice (ID) feature

    ![Setting up external channels.](media/apac-idn-import-setup-external-channels.png)

If you must import vendor invoices into, for example, a different legal entity, create a new channel record that has the new document context.

## Process electronic invoices in Finance

When issued invoices or imported vendor invoices are processed through Electronic invoicing, you can complete the following tasks:

- Submit or export issued invoices, and import vendor invoices.
- View the electronic document submission and receipt logs.

### Submit or export issued invoices

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Electronic documents** \> **Submit electronic documents**.
2. Set the **Submit document batch** option to **Yes** to export invoices in batch. Otherwise, each invoice is exported separately. The first time that you submit a document, always set the **Resubmit documents** option to **No**. If you must resubmit a document through the service, set this option to **Yes**.
3. On the **Records to include** FastTab, select **Filter** to open the **Inquiry** dialog box, where you can build a query to select documents for export.
4. Go to **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Business events** \> **Business events parameters**, and then select **Business events batch job**. If you set up the Business event batch processor, this job can be run in batch mode.

### View submission logs

You can view the submission logs for all exported documents.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Electronic documents**\ > **Electronic document submission log**.
2. Select **Update status**. An invoice batch can have the following statuses:

    - Scheduled
    - Completed
    - Failed

3. On the Action Pane, select **Inquiries** \> **Submission details** to view the details of the submission execution logs. The information in the logs is divided among three FastTabs:

    - **Processing actions** – This FastTab shows the execution log for the actions that are configured in the feature version that was set up in RCS. The **Status** column shows whether the action was successfully run.
    - **Action files** – This FastTab shows the intermediate files that were generated during execution of the actions. Select **View** to download and view the file.
    - **Processing action log** – This FastTab shows the results of the submission of electronic invoices.

4. On the Action Pane, select **Inquiries** \> **Batch submission invoices** to view invoices that were submitted in one batch.

### Import vendor invoices and view the electronic document receipt log

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Electronic documents** \> **Receive electronic documents**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the first receipt of any document, always set the **Re-import documents** option to **No**. If you must re-import a document through the service, set this option to **Yes**. This job can be run in batch mode.

2. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Electronic documents** \> **Electronic document receipt log**.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Inquiries** \> **Submission details** to view the details of the submission execution logs.
