# Declaration 347 report
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Declaration 347 report must be electronically submitted to the tax authorities every year, during the first 20 days of March. It must include all the information from the previous fiscal year (January through December). All transactions over 3,000 euros must be included. Additionally, cash payment amounts that exceed 6,000 euros in a year must be included. Amounts are split per quarter over the year.

You can use the **Declaration 347** page to generate the Declaration 347 report. All invoices are grouped either by tax exempt number and customer/vendor number, or only by tax exempt number. The resulting aggregated line is included on the **Declaration 347** page if the total amount of invoices on the line exceeds the value of the **Minimum amount** field that is set in the **Declaration 347** dialog box. If some invoices are paid in cash, and the total amount of cash payments for invoices on the line exceeds the value of the **Minimum amount of payments in cash** field in the **Declaration 347** dialog box, this amount will be shown in the **Amounts in cash** field of the declaration.

![Transactions page](media/6_Transactions.png)

Notice the following details:

-   The line for customer **DE-012** wasn't transferred to the declaration because both amounts were less than 6,000.
-   On the line for customer **DE-011** (tax exempt number **01396365B**), because the payment amount in cash is less than 6,000 it was reset to 0 (zero).
-   On the line for vendor **DE-001** (tax exempt number **03566243B**), even though the payment was in cash, the cash payment amount is 0 (zero) because the **Amounts in cash** field is filled in only for customers.

4.  Close the **Transactions** page, and then, on the **Declaration 347** page, select **Generate** to generate the report that has corrections.
5.  Set the **Replacement declaration** option to **Yes** to identify this declaration as a correction of the original declaration.

7.  Select the declaration line that is created, select **Transactions**, and edit the line for customer with tax exempt number **DE9801** in the following way:

-   The value in **1st quarter amount** column becomes 7000 instead of 6500
