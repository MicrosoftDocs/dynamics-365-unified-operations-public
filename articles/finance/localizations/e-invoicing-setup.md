# Set up the Electronic invoicing add-on

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


Electronic invoicing add-on feature setup is the process of creating the required configuration through the Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) environment and publishing that configuration to the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The setup lets you create the configurable rules that enable the Electronic invoicing add-on to use a secure protocol over the internet to communicate and exchange data with a third-party entity through web services.

The configurability relies on the Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration as a means to build content that is sent and received through digital files. It also relies on the orchestration of communication actions to send requests to and receive responses from third-party web services without requiring that you write code.

## Overview

"The Electronic invoicing add-on feature" is the generic name for the resource that is configured and published to consume the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The feature setup combines, among other things, the use of ER configuration formats to create configurable export and import files, and the use of actions and actions flows to enable the creation of configurable rules to send requests, import responses, and parse the response contents.

The following illustration shows the main components of an Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

![Electronic invoicing add-on feature overview](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Overview-e-Invoicing-feature.png)

Because of variations in invoice formats and action flows, the feature setup might vary according to country or region, or according to business requirements.

## Set up the Electronic invoicing add-on feature

The setup process must be completed in your RCS environment. Follow these steps to create a new Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

1. Sign in to your RCS environment.
2. In the **Globalization features** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **Electronic invoicing add-on** tile.
3. On the **Electronic invoicing add-on features** page, select **Import** to import the ER data model configuration from the Global repository.
4. Select **Add** to create an Electronic invoicing add-on feature. You can either create the feature from the scratch or derive it from an existing Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

    ![Adding an Electronic invoicing add-on feature](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Add-e-Invoicing-feature.png)

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a new Electronic invoicing add-on feature, it has a version number, and its default status is set to **Draft**.

### Configurations

Configurations hold the ER format configurations that are required for transformations and to create the files that will be exchanged during the communication with third-party web services. An Electronic invoicing add-on feature can have as many ER file format configurations as are required, based on the integration technical specification that is provided by the web service provider.

Follow these steps to add ER formats to the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

1. On the **Electronic invoicing add-on features** page, on the **Configurations** tab, select **Add** to add ER file format configurations for the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

    ![Adding Electronic invoicing add-on feature configurations](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Add-e-Invoicing-feature-Configurations.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create an Electronic invoicing add-on feature from scratch, you must manually add all the ER file format configurations. When you derive an Electronic invoicing add-on feature from an existing feature, the ER file format configurations are automatically created, because they are inherited from the original Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

2. Select **Edit** to open the **Format designer** page, where you can edit the ER file format configuration.

    ![Editing Electronic invoicing add-on feature configurations](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Edit-e-Invoicing-feature-Configurations.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > While you're editing the format, the status of the configuration version is set to **Draft**.

3. Use the **Format designer** page to change the file format configuration. For more information, see [Create electronic document configurations](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-configuration).

    ![Format designer page](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-ER-Format-designer.png)

### Feature setups

Feature setups encapsulate the rules for communication and security with a third-party web service. An Electronic invoicing add-on feature can have as many feature setups as are required, based on the business rule that you want to accomplish.

Follow these steps to add feature setups to the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

1. On the **Electronic invoicing add-on features** page, on the **Setups** tab, select **Add** to add feature setups to the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

    ![Adding Electronic invoicing add-on feature setups](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Add-e-Invoicing-feature-Setups.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create an Electronic invoicing add-on feature from scratch, you must manually add all the feature setups that you require. When you derive an Electronic invoicing add-on feature from an existing feature, all feature setups are automatically created, because they are inherited from the original Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

2. Select **Edit** to edit the feature version setup.

    ![Editing Electronic invoicing add-on feature setups](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Edit-e-Invoicing-feature-Setups.png)

3. Use the **Feature version setup** page to configure actions, applicability rules, and variables.

    ![Actions, applicability rules, and variables](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-View-Actions-Applicability-Rules-Variables.png)

### Actions

Actions are a predefined list of operations that are run in sequential order. This list represents the breakdown of the steps that are required for full execution of the Electronic invoicing add-on feature. The actions can encapsulate, in the same Electronic invoicing add-on feature, communication in both directions: sending a request for a destination, and receiving a response and parsing its contents.

Each action contains a predefined list of parameters that are required for the action to accomplish its purpose. Additional parameters might optionally be provided.

#### Actions FastTab

On the **Feature versions setup** page, on the **Actions** tab, on the **Actions** FastTab, follow one or both of these steps to manage actions:

- Select **New** or **Delete** to add new actions or delete existing actions.
- Select **Up** or **Down** to move selected actions up or down in the grid and therefore change the order that they are run in. Actions are run in the order in which they appear in the grid, from top to bottom.

### Applicability rules

Applicability rules let you create logical rules that determine the usage context for the feature setup. Thus, the matching between the context given by the business document that is sent for processing, along with the applicability rule criteria, determine which Electronic invoicing add-on feature is used to process that submission.

#### Set up applicability rules

1. On the **Feature version setup** page, on **Applicability rules** tab, select **New** to add an applicability rule.

    ![Managing applicability rules](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Manage-Actions-Applicability-rules.png)

2. In the grid, select the clauses that should be grouped.
3. Select **Group clause**.

    ![Grouping clauses](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Manage-Applicability-rules-Group-clause.png)

    When clauses are grouped, a new column is added to the grid. This column specifies the logical operator for the grouped clauses.

    ![Logical operator for grouped clauses](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Manage-Applicability-rules-Group-criterias.png)

To ungroup clauses, select the grouped clauses to ungroup, and then select **Ungroup clause**.

![Ungrouping clauses](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Manage-Applicability-rules-UnGroup-criterias.png)

> [!NOTE]
> When you ungroup a clause, always start from the innermost grouping level.

The following table describes the fields that are available on the **Applicability rules** tab.

| Field         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| And/or        | The logical operator. |
| Field         | The field to use to construct the rule. |
| Operator type | The type of operator:<ul><li>Equal</li><li>Not equal</li><li>Greater than/Less than</li><li>Greater than or equal to/Less than or equal to</li><li>Contains</li><li>Begin with</li></ul> |
| Value         | The criterion for the rule. |

### Variables

You can create variables and then use them as the input value for a parameter of a specific action. You can also use them to exchange, between the Electronic invoicing add-on services and the client, information that is the result of execution of a specific action as part of the flow of submissions.

#### Set up variables

- On the **Feature version setup** page, on the **Variables** tab, select **New** or **Delete** to manage variables.

    ![Managing variables](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Manage-Variables.png)

The following table describes the fields that are available on the **Variables** tab.

| Field       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Name        | The name of the variable. |
| Description | A brief description of the variable. |
| Type        | The type of variable:<ul><li><strong>Constant</strong> – The content of the variable is fixed.</li><li><strong>From client</strong> – The content of the variable is acquired from the Microsoft Dynamics 365 client during execution of the submission process.</li><li><strong>To client</strong> – The content of the variable is made available for import by the Microsoft Dynamics 365 client during execution of the submission process.</li></ul> |
| Data type   | The data type of the variable:<ul><li>Boolean</li><li>Date</li><li>Number</li><li>UUID</li><li>String</li><li>File</li></ul> |
| Value       | The value of the variable or the name of the action that sets the value of the variable. |

### Validate the feature setup

- On the **Feature version setup** page, on the Action Pane, select **Validate** to validate the feature version setup.

   ![Selecting the Validate button](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Validate-Button.png)

The validation checks the consistency of the whole configuration. For example, if a specific parameter for an action is mandatory but its value remains blank, the validation detects this inconsistency, and you receive a warning.

## Environments

An Electronic invoicing add-on environment must be associated with the Electronic invoicing add-on feature and enabled for it. Electronic invoicing add-on environments must be created and published in advance, through the configuration of Globalization features in your organization's RCS account.

Follow these steps to enable an Electronic invoicing add-on environment for the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.

1. On the **Electronic invoicing add-on features** page, on the **Environments** tab, select **Enable** to add an Electronic invoicing add-on environment.
2. In the **Effective from** field, enter the date when the new environment becomes effective.

![Enabling an Electronic invoicing add-on environment](media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Enable-e-Invoicing-feature-Environment.png)

## Organizations

The Electronic invoicing add-on feature can be shared across multiple organizations.

- On the **Electronic invoicing add-on features** page, on the **Organizations** tab, select **Share with** to add the organization that you want to share the Electronic invoicing add-on feature with.

To stop sharing the Electronic invoicing add-on feature with the organization, select **Unshare**.
