[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Use the **Separate divisions** page to create a company division. If your company has several divisions, you must associate each division with a vendor.

## Create company divisions

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Separate divisions**.

2.  Create a new company division.

3.  In the **Separate division ID** field, enter the identification code for the division.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the division.

5.  In the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account number that is associated with the division.

6.  Select the **Independent** check box to indicate that the selected division can report the tax declarations independently of the head office.
