[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic includes a summary of the new features and critical bug fixes released in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.01 for APAC India GST localization. 

## New configuration 
The following configurations are available from the Shared Asset Library in LCS for use in version 10.0.1:
 
- GSTReturns.version.14.xml
- GST Returns model mapping.version.14.5.xml
- GSTR1CSV.version.14.28.xml
- GSTR2CSV.version.14.32.xml
 
The following GSTR issues are also resolved:
- Total item discount amount is not showing in GSTR.
- Item unit of measurement should show both unit and its description, and for service item, it should be **Nos**.
- No customer billing name for stock transfer in GSTR.

## Non-GST item
You can create a non-GST item that is the default for **Tax information** in taxable transactions.

  with zero amount.
- The **Tax transaction inquiry** page allows only 11 fields to be selected.
- GSTR2 takes the bill of entry posting date instead of the posting date for the import order.
