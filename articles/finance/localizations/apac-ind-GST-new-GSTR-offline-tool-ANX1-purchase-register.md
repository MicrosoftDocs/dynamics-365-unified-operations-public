# New GSTR Offline Tool for ANX-1 and Purchase Register

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In the newly proposed system for Goods and Services Tax Return (GSTR) filing, the taxpayer will have to file Form GST RET-1 (Normal), Form GST RET-2 (Sahaj), or Form GST RET-3 (Sugam) either monthly or quarterly. The Annexure of Supplies (GST ANX-1) and the Annexure of Inward Supplies (GST ANX-2) will be filed as part of these returns.

GST ANX-1 contains details about all outward and inward supplies that are liable for tax on the basis of reverse charges. These outward and inward supplies include imports and the inward supply of goods from special economic zones (SEZs). GST ANX-2 contains details about inward supplies only. These details are automatically filled in, mainly from suppliers' GST ANX-1. GST ANX-1 also contains details that are automatically filled in from Form GSTR-5 and Form GSTR-6.

The taxpayer must provide details about the inward supplies that are listed in GST ANX-2 by accepting or rejecting the entries. The taxpayer can also keep the documents pending by marking them accordingly.

Based on the details that are uploaded in GST ANX-1, and the actions that the taxpayer takes in GST ANX-2, the relevant fields in Form GST RET-1 are automatically updated. The taxpayer can then view and enter details in the relevant columns, save the information, and download a copy of the form in PDF format.

The Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) has released a trial version of the New Returns Offline Tool for Form GST ANX-1, Form GST ANX-2 (the Matching Tool is built in), and a template for the Purchase Register. The Purchase Register is used to import Purchase Register data so that it can be matched with GST ANX-2 data.

This topic provides information about how to set up and use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance to generate comma-separate values (CSV) files by using the New GSTR Offline Tool. It includes information about how to import the configuration, generate GST ANX-1, and generate the Purchase Register.

Generated GST ANX-1 and Purchase register reports are supported in the following version:

| Finance version | Build number   |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 10.0.13         | 10.0.569.10002 |

The solution that supports the reporting capabilities of the New Returns Offline Tool is based on Electronic reporting (ER) functionality. This functionality provides a flexible approach for setting up and supporting reporting processes.

## Setup

Complete the following tasks to prepare Finance to report GST ANX-1:

1. Import and set up ER configurations.
2. Map the reporting configuration in the tax setup.
3. Provide report data for report generation.

    - Generate the ANX-1 report which contains 10 CSV files.

4. Provide report data for report generation:

    - Generate the Purchase Register in a Microsoft Excel file format.

## Import the tax configuration

- Taxable Document.version.82
- Taxable Document (India).version 82.155
- Tax (India GST).version.82.155.300

## Import and set up ER configurations

To prepare Finance for GSTR reporting, you must import the following versions of ER configurations, or later versions, in the order that they are listed in.

| ER configuration name           | Type               | Format | Version |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|--------|---------|
