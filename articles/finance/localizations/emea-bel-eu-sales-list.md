### Set up information about the company

Create a registration type, and assign it to the **VAT ID** registration category for every country or region that your company does business with. Create another registration type, and assign it to the **Enterprise ID (COID)** registration category for the company. For more information, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. In the grid, select your company.
3. On the **Addresses** FastTab, set the city, ZIP/postal code, and street for the primary address.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > The company name, city, ZIP/postal code, and street for the primary address, the primary email address, and primary telephone number will be shown on the EU sales list report.
