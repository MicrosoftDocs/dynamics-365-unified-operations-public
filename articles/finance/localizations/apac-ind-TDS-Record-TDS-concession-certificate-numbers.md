4. In the **Withholding tax code** field, select the TDS tax code that the vendor concession certificates are issued for. The **Withholding tax code name** field shows the name of the TDS tax code.
5. In the **From date** and **To date** fields, define the period of validity for the concession certificate that uses the TDS tax code to calculate TDS for the vendor on a concessional basis.
6. In the **Remarks** field, enter any remarks.
7. In the **Section** field, enter the legal section code that the TDS concession certificate is availed under.

    If the section code is 197, the value "A" appears in both the "Reason for non-deduction/lower deduction" column in Form 26Q and the "Reason for non-deduction/lower deduction/grossing up (if any)" column in Form 27Q. If the section code is 197A, the value "B" appears in both those places.

8. Select the **Certificate** FastTab to record TDS concession certificate numbers for vendors.
9. In the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account that the TDS concession certificate is issued for.
10. In the **From date** and **To date** fields, define the period of validity for the TDS concession certificate.

    The calculation of TDS on a concessional basis is based on the period when the certificate is created for the vendor.
