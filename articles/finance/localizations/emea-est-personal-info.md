# Personal information requests for Estonia

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Estonia legally allows people to ask companies for reports that identify the personal information that the companies track. The reports also indicate who has viewed, created, updated, and deleted this information.

All companies must gather data about employees, customers, and vendors, and also other personal data. When the data is gathered about persons, most of the information is considered personal data and must be handled correctly according to the Estonian legislation. All information that comes from logging changes or inquiries on tables that are related to personal data is presented on three defined reports: **Personal chart**, **Access log**, and **Permission changes**.

## Reports that are available

- **Access log** – This report shows the fields and tables that are related to an employee's personal information, and that have been accessed within a specified period. To generate the report, go to **Human resources** \> **Workers** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Access log**.
- **Permission changes log** – This report shows changes to an employee's permissions to access information, the employee's security rights, or the employee's user role. You can view the permission changes either as an overall list for the employee, or as a breakdown of tables and fields. To generate and print the report, go to **Human resources** \> **Workers** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Permission changes log**.
- **Personal chart** – This report shows a selected employee's personal information. To generate the report, go to **Human resources** \> **Workers** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Personal chart**.
