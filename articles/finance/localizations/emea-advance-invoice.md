# Advance invoices for Eastern Europe

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about advance invoices for Eastern Europe. An advance invoice is a document that you can create for a customer or vendor. It states the amount that must be prepaid on a sales order. 

> [!NOTE]
> Another option is to use the prepayment invoice functionality. As of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.28, you can use this functionality by going to **Accounts payable** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Parameters** &gt; **Ledger and sales tax** and setting the **Use prepayment invoice** option on the **Prepayment invoice** FastTab to **Yes**. For more information, see [Prepayment invoices vs. prepayments](../accounts-payable/prepayments-invoices-vs-prepayments.md).

Advance invoice functionality lets you perform the following tasks:

- Issue advance invoices to customers, and track the status of those advance invoices (**Open**, **Partially paid**, or **Closed**).
- *For Poland only:* Post advance invoice transactions and value-added tax (VAT) transactions.
- Automatically generate payment journal lines, based on an advance invoice.
- Link prepayments that are received from customers to advance invoices (either before or after you post the prepayment).
- Change the VAT posting in posted prepayments (that is, convert a prepayment to a payment or a payment to a prepayment, or change the posting date, tax rate, or amount).
- *For the Czech Republic only:* Create a tax document for the VAT liable delivery.

## Advance invoices for Poland

Polish companies that receive prepayments must create an invoice for prepayments for the customer. This advance invoice is posted to the general ledger and is a mandatory document for VAT tax purposes. The tax that is calculated on the advance invoice must be reported to the tax authority.

When the final sale of goods is performed, the advance invoice should be specified on the sales invoice. The total amount of sales must include prepayments.

When the sales invoice is posted, the settled advance invoice is reversed. The original advance invoice is settled with an advance invoice reversal.

## Set up Accounts receivable for advance invoices

1. On the **Accounts receivable parameters** page, on the **Updates** tab, on the **Advance invoice** FastTab, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Posting profile | <p>*For Poland only:* Select the posting profile to use with advance invoicing.</p><p>**Important:** For the Czech Republic and Hungary, advance invoices aren't treated as accounting or tax documents, and they aren't posted to the general ledger. Therefore, you should leave this field blank for those countries, to prevent advance invoices from being posted to the general ledger.</p> |
    | Offset account | Select the offset account. |
    | Sales tax group | Select the sales tax group to use when sales tax is calculated for advance invoicing. |
    | Reversal as correction | Select this checkbox if the reversal of an advance invoice should be considered a correction. |

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Multiple prepayment dates | Select **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**. |
    | Date mismatch | Select **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**. |
    | Amount mismatch | Select **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**. |
    | Linking to posted advance invoice | Select **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**. |
    | (CZE), (POL) Prepayment handling | Select **Advanced**. |

1. Enter the required information, and then select **Post** to post the advance invoice.

An advance invoice can have one of the following statuses: **Opened**, **Partially paid**, or **Closed**. You can manually change the status of an advance invoice that has been posted.

## VAT on advance invoices

Companies must record VAT on prepayments from customers, even though the sale hasn't been completed. To post VAT from a prepayment, you can add a line that contains specifications of VAT to an advance invoice. An advance invoice can have several lines, and those lines can contain VAT specifications that are taken from sales order lines. Therefore, you can post VAT from a prepayment in strict accordance with sales order lines.

> [!NOTE]
> The VAT specifications are copied to the advance invoice lines only if the **Type of tax** field on the **Sales tax codes** page is set to **Standard VAT** or **Reduced VAT**. Otherwise, they are copied to the advance invoice lines as if the VAT amount is 0 (zero).

## Link an advance invoice to a sales order or a free text invoice
