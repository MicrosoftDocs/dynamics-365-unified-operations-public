# Working clothes/special rigging accounting (Russia)

## About working clothes and special rigging accounting

An organization must account for each working clothes or special rigging asset that is issued to an employee. For each of these assets, the organization must create a working clothes or special rigging issue record.

You can create queries to show all assets that are on hand for employees, and you can print the **Working clothes issue sheet (No. MB-7)** report. You can also cancel the working clothes or special rigging issue, or return it to inventory. Finally, you can calculate the net book value and the residual wear or usage period.

Working clothes and special rigging assets are regulated by their useful life. This period starts when the item is written off from a warehouse and issued to an employee. It ends after a specified period of use. The useful life of each item is specified in months.

All the data that is related to an item is linked. This information includes the identity of the employee, the useful life of the item, the date when the item is issued to the employee, and the end date that is calculated based on the rating of the item.

When the end of the item's useful life approaches, the item is written off, so that it's no longer assigned to the employee.

The cost of working clothes and special rigging assets must be amortized during their life cycle. If the life cycle is longer than 12 months (the legally defined period length), the linear method of depreciation is used. If the life cycle is shorter than 12 months, the cost is written off when the item is issued to the employee.

The **Working clothes** and **Special rigging** pages resemble the **Fixed assets** page that is used to account for all working clothes and special rigging that are issued.

The following sections describe the setup that you must complete to account for working clothes and special rigging assets.

## Set up types of issue and usage rates

Use the **Types of issue and usage rates** page to define the types of issue and usage rates that determine which working clothes and special rigging are issued to employees.

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Working clothes/Special riggings/NVFA** \> **Type of rate**.
2. In the **Type of rate** field, enter the identification code for the rate type.
3. In the **Description** field, enter a short description of the rate type.
4. Select the **Over-rate** check box to indicate that quantity control that is based on the defined rate isn't required for item issues for the specified rate type.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this check box is selected, the rate type is used only to specify the wear or usage period of an asset.

## Create a working clothes or special rigging issue journal 

Use the **Working clothes/Special rigging/NVFA issue** page to issue an item from the warehouse to an employee. Working clothes items, special rigging items, and not valuable fixed assets (NVFAs) are separate assets. When an issue journal is posted, separate cards are created on the **Working clothes**, **Special rigging**, and **Not valuable FAs** pages.

When new working clothes or special rigging items are issued, the following actions occur:

- A working clothes or special rigging card is created for each journal line, and the lines are updated on the **Working clothes** or **Special rigging** page.
- A fixed asset number is generated for the asset, based on the number sequence that is specified on the **Fixed assets parameters** page.
- The quantity of the working clothes or special rigging item equals the item quantity that is specified on the journal line. On the **Componentry** page, the quantity of the corresponding item is updated to **1** for each asset that is created.
- The value models and depreciation group are also updated on the cards. If you select the **Service life by rate** check box on the **FA value models** page, the wear or usage period is determined based on the depreciation group. If the **Service life by rate** check box is cleared, the wear or usage period is taken from the issued journal line. The cost is the same for all value models and is selected from the cost price of the item line.
- The status of the asset is updated to **Scheduled**. Additionally, the acquisition date is updated with the date of the journal transaction, and the acquisition amount is updated with the cost price that is posted for the item line.

When used working clothes or special rigging items are issued, if the serial number of the card for the issued item has already been filled in for the inventory transaction that corresponds to the posted journal line, the following actions occur:

- The issue journal that was created earlier is searched and copied by using the Serial number inventory dimension.
- The cost price is selected from the item cost price for the base value model.
- The useful life is updated for the working clothes or special rigging item.
- The residual wear or usage period is calculated by subtracting the past lifetime from the lifetime that is defined by the usage   rate.

> [!NOTE]
> For an issue or reissue transaction, when the journal is posted, fixed asset journals are automatically created and posted. These fixed asset journals contain transactions for putting the asset into operation, depreciation transactions, and writing-off transactions.
