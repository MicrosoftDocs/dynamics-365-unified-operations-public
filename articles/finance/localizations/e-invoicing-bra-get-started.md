# Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on for Brazil 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Electronic invoicing add-on for Brazil doesn't currently support all the functions that are available in the fiscal document integration that is built into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

This topic provides information that will help you get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on for Brazil. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) and in Finance and Supply Chain Management. It also guides you through the process of submitting an NF-e fiscal document (Electronic fiscal document model 55) through the service, and it explains how review the processing results and the status of the fiscal documents.

## Prerequisites

Before you complete the steps in this topic, you must complete the steps in [Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on](e-invoicing-get-started.md).

## RCS setup

During the RCS setup, you will complete these tasks:

1. Import the e-Invoicing feature for NF-e fiscal documents.
2. Review the file formats that are required to submit NF-e fiscal documents for authorization.
3. Review the file formats that are required to request the cancellation of an approved NF-e.
4. Configure the event that is required to submit NF-e fiscal documents for authorization.
5. Configure the event that is required to request the cancellation of an approved NF-e.
6. Assign the e-Invoicing feature to an Electronic invoicing add-on environment.
7. Publish the e-Invoicing feature.

> [!NOTE]
> "The e-Invoicing feature" is the generic name for the resource that is configured and published to consume the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The setup of the e-Invoicing feature combines, among other things, the use of Electronic reporting (ER) configuration formats to create configurable export and import files, and the use of actions and actions flows to enable the creation of configurable rules to send requests, import responses, and parse the response contents.

## Import the e-Invoicing feature

1. Sign in to your RCS account
2. In the **Globalization features** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **e-Invoicing** tile.
3. On the **e-Invoicing Features** page, select **Import** to import a NF-e fiscal document e-Invoicing feature from the Global repository.
