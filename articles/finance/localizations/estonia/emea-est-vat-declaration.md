# VAT declaration for Estonia

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to set up and generate a value-added tax (VAT) declaration for Estonia in the official XML format. It also describes how to preview the VAT declaration in Microsoft Excel.

As of 10.0.36 version of Dynamics 365 Finance, the VAT declaration feature for Estonia supports filing a VAT return for [multiple VAT registrations](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md) and for companies that report as a VAT group in the same system database. For each version of Finance that's listed in the following table, these capabilities are supported as of the specified build number.

| Version | Build | 
|---------|-------|
| 10.0.38 | 10.0.1777.94 |
| 10.0.37 | 10.0.1725.138 |
| 10.0.36 | 10.0.1695.149 |

## VAT declaration overview

To automatically generate the report, first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each type of operation that's subject to reporting in the VAT declaration for Estonia. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the Electronic reporting (ER) format for the VAT declaration, associate available sales tax transaction attributes (sales tax code, tax classifier, item sales tax group, and sales tax group) with the lookup result of the **Report field lookup** lookup field. In the following table, the "Lookup result" column shows the lookup result that's preconfigured for a specific VAT declaration field (tag) in the VAT declaration format. Use this information to correctly associate tax transaction attributes with the lookup result and then with the field (tag) of the VAT declaration.

## Set up the VAT declaration for Estonia

These tasks will prepare your Finance environment to generate the electronic file for the VAT declaration for Estonia and preview the VAT amounts in Excel format.

- [Import ER configurations](#import-er).
- [Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields](#set-up).
- [Set up the VAT reporting format to preview amounts in Excel](#setup-preview).
- [Set up electronic messages](#setup-em).
- [Set up the VAT registration number of the company that's reporting VAT](#vat-id).

### <a name="import-er"></a>Import ER configurations

Open the **Electronic reporting** workspace, and import the latest versions of these ER formats under **Tax declaration model**:

- VAT Declaration XML (EE)
- VAT Declaration Excel (EE)

For more information, see [Download ER configurations from the Global repository of Configuration service](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).

### <a name="set-up"></a>Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields

To automatically generate the VAT declaration, associate available sales tax transaction attributes (sales tax code, tax classifier, item sales tax group, and sales tax group) in Finance and lookup results in the ER configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you enable the **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled, parameters that are configured for an earlier version of an ER format automatically become applicable for a later version of the same format. If this feature isn't enabled, you must explicitly configure application-specific parameters for each format version. The **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature is available in the **Feature management** workspace as of Finance version 10.0.23. For more information about how to set up the parameters of an ER format for each legal entity, see [Set up the parameters of an ER format per legal entity](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-app-specific-parameters-set-up.md).

Follow these steps to define which of the available sales tax transaction attributes (sales tax code, tax classifier, item sales tax group, or sales tax group) in Finance generates which field of the VAT declaration for Estonia.

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**, and select **Reporting configurations**.
2. Select the **VAT declaration XML (EE)** configuration, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Configurations** \> **Application specific parameters setup**.
3. On the **Application specific parameters** page, on the **Lookups** FastTab, select **Report field lookup**.
4. On the **Conditions** FastTab, set the following fields to associate the sales tax codes and report fields.

    | Field | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Lookup result | Select the value of the report field. For more information about the values and their assignment to VAT declaration rows, see the [VAT declaration overview](#vat-declaration-overview) section earlier in this article. |
    | Tax code | Select the sales tax code to associate with the report field. Posted tax transactions that use the selected sales tax code will be collected in the appropriate declaration box. We recommend that you separate sales tax codes in such a way that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box. |
    | Transaction classifier | <p>If you created enough sales tax codes to determine a declaration box, select **\*Not blank\***. If you didn't create enough sales tax codes so that one sales tax code generates amounts in only one declaration box, you can set up a transaction classifier. The following transaction classifiers are available:</p><ul><li>**Purchase**</li><li>**PurchaseExempt** (tax-exempt purchase)</li><li>**PurchaseReverseCharge** (tax receivable from a purchase reverse charge)</li><li>**Sales**</li><li>**SalesExempt** (tax-exempt sale)</li><li>**SalesReverseCharge** (tax payable from a purchase reverse charge or a sales reverse charge)</li><li>**Use tax**</li></ul><p>For each transaction classifier, a classifier for the credit note is also available. For example, one of these classifiers is **PurchaseCreditNote** (purchase credit note).</p><p>Be sure to create two lines for each sales tax code: one that has the transaction classifier value and one that has the transaction classifier for credit note value.</p> |
    | Item sales tax group | Use the **Item sales tax group** column to supplement your setup that's specified with **Tax code** and **Transaction classifier** columns when necessary. |
    | Sales tax group | Use the **Sales tax group** column to supplement your setup that's specified with **Tax code** and **Transaction classifier** columns when necessary. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Associate all sales tax codes (or combinations of a sales tax code, tax classifier, item sales tax group, and sales tax group) with lookup results. If any combination should not generate values on the VAT declaration, associate it with the **Other** lookup result.

5. In the **State** field, change the value to **Completed**.
6. On the Action Pane, select **Export** to export the settings of the application-specific parameters.
7. Select the **VAT declaration Excel (EE)** configuration, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Import** to import the parameters that you configured for **VAT declaration XML (EE)**.
8. In the **State** field, select **Completed**.

### <a name="setup-preview"></a>Set up the VAT reporting format to preview amounts in Excel

1. In the **Feature management** workspace, find and select the **VAT statement format reports** feature in the list, and then select **Enable now**.
2. Go to **Tax** \> **Indirect taxes** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax authorities**, and select the tax authority.
3. In the **Report layout** field, select **Default**.
4. Go to **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
5. On the **Sales tax** tab, on the **Tax options** FastTab, in the **VAT statement format mapping** field, select the **VAT declaration Excel (EE)** ER format.

This format is printed when you run the **Report sales tax for settlement period** report. It's also printed when you select **Print** on the **Sales tax payments** page.

If you're configuring the VAT declaration for Estonia in a legal entity that has [multiple VAT registrations](../global/emea-reporting-for-multiple-vat-registrations.md), follow these steps.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
2. On the **Sales tax** tab, on the **Electronic reporting for countries/regions** FastTab, on the line for **EST**, select the **VAT Declaration Excel (EE)** ER format.

### <a name="setup-em"></a>Set up electronic messages

Electronic messaging (EM) functionality is provided to maintain the different processes that are used in electronic reporting for different document types. For more information about electronic messages, see [Electronic messaging](../../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.md).

#### <a name="import-em"></a>Download and import the data package that has example settings for electronic messages

The process of setting up the **Electronic messages** functionality to generate the VAT declaration for Estonia in XML format and preview it in Excel has many steps. Because the data of some entities is used in the ER configurations, use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables. You can extend these settings or create your own.

> [!NOTE]
> Some records in the data entities in the package include a link to ER configurations. Before you start to import the data entities package, [import ER configurations into Finance](#import-er).

1. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2), in the Shared asset library, select **Data package** as the asset type, and then download **EE VAT declaration - KMD - EM setup v.\#**.

### <a id="vat-id"></a>Set up the VAT registration number of the company that's reporting VAT

To generate the VAT declaration, you must configure the tax registration number of your organization.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**.
2. Select the legal entity, and then select **Registration IDs**.
3. Select or create the address in Estonia, and then, on the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
4. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that's dedicated to Estonia and that uses the **VAT ID** registration category.
5. In the **Registration number** field, enter the tax number.
6. On the **General** tab, in the **Effective** field, enter the date when the number becomes effective.

For more information about how to set up registration categories and registration types, see [Registration IDs](../europe/emea-registration-ids.md).

Follow these steps to define the VAT registration number that EM uses during generation of the VAT declaration for Estonia.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages processing**, and select the **EE VAT declaration** processing.

3. Save your changes.

If the VAT registration number isn't specified in the **Tax registration number** additional field of the **EE VAT declaration** processing, the system retrieves it from the registration ID that's defined in the properties of the legal entity that's associated with the **VAT ID** registration category.

### Preview the VAT declaration in Excel from a sales tax payment

Sales tax payment transactions are produced by the [Settle and post sales tax](../../general-ledger/tasks/create-sales-tax-payment.md) job procedure that settles sales tax balances in the sales tax accounts and offsets them to the sales tax settlement account for a given period. After the **Settle and post sales tax** job procedure is completed for an interval of the sales tax settlement period, you can generate the VAT declaration in Excel from the **Sales tax payments** page.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Sales tax inquiries** \> **Sales tax payments**, and select a sales tax payment line.
2. Select **Print report**, and then select **OK**.
3. Review the Excel file that's generated for the selected sales tax payment line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The report is generated only for the selected line of the sales tax payment. If you must generate, for example, a corrective declaration that contains all corrections for the period, or a replacement declaration that contains original data and all corrections, use the [Report sales tax for settlement period](#report-sales-tax-for-settlement-period) periodic task.

3. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Populate records actions**.
4. On the **Populate records action** page, select the line for **EE Populate VAT return records**.

    In the **Datasources setup** grid, a new **Company** field is available. For existing records, this field shows the identifier of the current legal entity.

5. In the **Datasources setup** grid, add a line for each additional legal entity that must be included in reporting. For each new line, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Name | Enter a value that will help you understand where this record comes from. For example, enter **VAT payment of Subsidiary 1**. |

    | Document account field | Specify **TaxPeriod** for all the records. |
    | Company | Select the ID of the legal entity. |
    | User query | This checkbox is automatically selected when you define criteria by selecting **Edit query**. |

6. For each new line, select **Edit query**, and specify a related settlement period for the legal entity that's specified in the **Company** field on the line.

    When the setup is completed, the **Collect data** function on the **Electronic messages** page collects sales tax payments from all legal entities that you defined.
