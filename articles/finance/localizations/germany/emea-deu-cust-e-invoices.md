# Customer electronic invoices in Germany

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

To comply with European Union (EU) Directive 2014/55/EU, the Germany-specific **xRechnung** format has been implemented. This article explains how to set up and process customer electronic invoices in **xRechnung** format.

## Prerequisites

Before you complete the procedures in this article, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Germany.
- To enable the generation of electronic invoices in **xRechnung** format version **3** and later, import the specified or later versions of the following Electronic reporting (ER) format configurations. For more information, see [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-import-ger-configurations.md).

    - **Sales Invoice DE** (version 288.9.16.11)
    - **Project Invoice DE** (version 288.8.22.12)
    - **Invoice model mapping** (version 288.293)

> [!NOTE]
> The **Sales Invoice DE** and **Project Invoice DE** format configurations are based on the corresponding **Peppol** format configurations. Those format configurations are based on the **UBL** format configurations that use the **Invoice model** configuration and the **Invoice model mapping** configuration. All remaining additional configurations are automatically imported.

## Configure parameters

### Send e-invoices to ER destinations

You can set up ER destinations for electronic invoice formats. In this case, output XML files that contain electronic invoices are automatically sent to the defined destinations immediately after the invoices are posted. When you post the invoices, you must turn on the **Print invoice** parameter.

For more information about ER destinations, see [Electronic reporting destinations](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-destinations.md).
