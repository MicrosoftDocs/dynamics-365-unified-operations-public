# What's new or changed for APAC India GST Localization in 10.0.07 (January 2020) 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic includes a summary of the new features and critical bug fixes released in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.07 for APAC India GST localization. 

## New features
### Create tax component with pre-defined rules 

You can create a new component with pre-defined rules that support GST behaviors including non-deductible and 
reverse charge for purchases and sales. With this feature, you do not need to create a tax component, which includes adding tax measures, configuring the tax calculation formula, and configuring a tax posting profile. 

You can enable the feature in **Feature management** workspace. The feature name is **Enable creating tax component with pre-defined rules**.

 With the feature enabled, there are several controls enabled in the dialog box. You can use them to control the behavior 
 of the tax component. For more information, see [Create tax components](tax-engine-create-tax-component.md).
