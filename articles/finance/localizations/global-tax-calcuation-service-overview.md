The tax calculation service is a hyper-scalable multitenant service that enables the global tax engine to automate and simplify the tax determination and calculation process. The tax engine is fully configurable. The elements that can be configured include, but aren't limited to, the taxable data model, tax code, tax applicability matrix, and tax calculation formula. The tax engine runs on the Microsoft Azure core services platform, and offers modern technology and exponential scalability.

The tax calculation service integrates with Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. Eventually, it will also integrate with Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Commerce, and other first-party and third-party applications.

The tax calculation service is a Microsoft-based tax engine that offers exponential scalability. It can help you perform the following tasks:

- Configure the tax calculation service through Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS). RCS is an enhanced version of the Electronic reporting (ER) designer and is available as a standalone service.
- Configure the tax matrix to automatically determine tax codes and rates.
- Configure the tax matrix to automatically determine the tax registration number.
- Configure the tax calculation designer to define formulas and conditions.
- Share the tax determination and calculation solution across legal entities.

To use the tax calculation service, install the tax calculation service add-in from your project in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). Then complete the setup in RCS, and enable the tax calculation service in Finance and Supply Chain Management. For more information, see [Get started with tax service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2138482).

## Availability

The tax calculation service is available only in sandbox environments and to selected customers, through a public preview program. Eventually, it will become generally available to all customers and in production environments.

New features will continue to be delivered in the tax calculation service. Therefore, be sure to check the most up-to-date documentation often to learn about the coverage and scope of supported features.

The tax calculation service is deployed in the following Azure geographies. It will also be deployed to more Azure geographies, based on customer needs:

- United States
- Europe
- France
- United Kingdom

> [!NOTE]
