# VAT declaration (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the the value-added tax (VAT) declaration for Russia. It includes instructions for setting up and generating the VAT declaration.

## Set up the VAT declaration

To start to work with the VAT declaration, follow these steps.

1. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2), in the Shared asset library, download the latest versions of the Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the VAT declaration format:

    - **VAT declaration model (RU)**
    - **VAT declaration model mapping (RU)**
    - **VAT declaration format 5.05** – This configuration is required in order to generate the VAT declaration for the year 2018 reporting period.
    - **VAT declaration format 5.06** – This configuration is required in order to generate the VAT declaration for the year 2019 reporting period.

    For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).

2. Download and import the Data management package settings.

    The data package contains the following items:

    - Financial reports and financial report cells for the 2018 and 2019 VAT declarations
    - Electronic message settings that are used to generate VAT declarations in electronic formats 5.05 and 5.06

    Follow these steps:

    1. In the LCS Shared asset library, select **Data package** as the asset type. Download the package that is named **VAT declaration v.5.05 v.5.06 package**. The file that is downloaded is named **VAT declaration v.5.05 v.5.06 package.zip**.
    2. In the **Data management** workspace, select **Import**.
    3. In the **Job details** section, set the following values:

        - In the **Name** field, enter any name for the job.
        - In the **Data source format** field, select **Package**.

    4. In the **Upload data file** field, select **Upload**, and then select the **VAT declaration v.5.05 v.5.06 package.zip** file that you downloaded earlier.
    5. After the data entities are uploaded, select **Import**.

3. In Finance, go to **General ledger \> Financial reports setup \> Financial reports**, and validate the financial reports that you imported. (All the data that was imported is presented only in the Russian language.)

    | Report | Report code | Description |
    |---|---|---|
    | VAT declaration 2018 | НДС 2018 | Декларация по налогу на добавленную стоимость (2018) |
    | VAT declaration 2019 | НДС 2019 | Декларация по налогу на добавленную стоимость (2019) |

4. Select the line for the **НДС 2019** report code, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Setup**.
5. On the **Requisites setup** page, sort the financial report cells by the **Description** column. Then review the list of the financial report cells.
6. Optional: Set up a financial report for the VAT declaration, and set up calculation rules for financial report cells.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You should complete this optional step if you use financial reports to generate data for some cells in section 3 of the VAT declaration, based on the setup of financial report cells.

    For more information about how to set up financial reports for Russia, see [Financial reporting (Russia)](rus-financial-reports.md).

7. Go to **Tax \> Inquiries and reports \> Electronic messages \> Electronic messages**, and validate the electronic message processing that you imported. (Most of the data that was imported is presented in the Russian language.)

    | Processing | Processing code | Description |
    |---|---|---|
    | VAT declaration 2018 | НДС 5.05 (2018) | Декларация по налогу на добавленную стоимость (2018) |
    | VAT declaration 2019 | НДС 5.06 (2019) | Декларация по налогу на добавленную стоимость (2019) |

8. Follow these steps to set up the ER format that is run when the VAT declaration is generated in electronic format:

    1. Go to **Tax \> Setup \> Electronic messages \> Message processing actions**.
    2. Select the **Generate NDS 5.05** action, and then select **Edit**.
    3. Set the **Show dialog** option to **Yes**.
    4. In the **Format mapping** field, select the **VAT declaration format 5.05** ER configuration that you downloaded earlier.
    5. Select the **Generate NDS 5.06** action, and then select **Edit**. 
    6. Set the **Show dialog** option to **Yes**.
    7. In the **Format mapping** field, select the **VAT declaration format 5.06** ER configuration that you downloaded earlier.

## Russian VAT declaration versions 5.05 and 5.06 in XML format

In the **Electronic reporting** module, you can review versions 5.05 and 5.06 of the Russian VAT declaration in XML format. The VAT declaration contains the following information:

> [!NOTE]
> Requisites that are marked with an asterisk (\*) in the preceding tables are automatically calculated based on registered documents, as described earlier in this topic. If you set up financial report calculation rules for the report cells for those requisites, the calculated amounts of the financial report will be added to the amounts that are automatically calculated. For information about how to replace the automatic calculation with the financial report cell calculation, see the [Customize section 3 of the VAT declaration](#customize-section-3-of-the-vat-declaration) section of this topic.

The setup of the financial report for the VAT declaration from the **VAT declaration v.5.05 v.5.06 package.zip** data package in the LCS Shared asset library contains the required names of the cells.

### Customize section 3 of the VAT declaration

In the **VAT declaration model (RU)** ER configuration, section 3 is represented by the **Declaration items** element. In the **VAT declaration model mapping (RU)** ER configuration, this element is bound to the **$RRG.$Section3.$data** data source. This data source is configured as **$RRG.$Section3.$data = LISTJOIN(@.'$dataStd', @.'$dataCustom')**. It refers to two data sources:

- **$RRG.$Section3.$data.$dataStd** – This data source is configured to access the **VAT Declaration helper (RU)** application class by calling the **getSection3data** method. This method produces a list that has the amounts of several boxes in section 3.
- **$RRG.$Section3.$data.$dataCustom** – This data source is configured to access the **LedgerRRGCustomReportHelper\_RU** application class by calling the **getCustomReportData** method. This method produces the record list that has calculated amounts for some financial report cells that the user configured.

To customize the declaration, follow one of these steps.

- Set up the financial report to calculate cells that aren't automatically calculated by the **VAT Declaration helper (RU)** class.

    In this case, you should to set up financial report calculation rules for report cells that aren't marked with an asterisk (\*) in the tables in the previous section.

- Set up the financial report to fully calculate cells based on the user setup instead of through automatic calculation.

    In this case, follow these steps:

    1. Set up financial report calculation rules for all required cells. These required cells include the cells that marked with an asterisk (\*) in the tables in the previous section.
    2. Create a customized **Model mapping** ER configuration. Derive it from the configuration that is provided by the Microsoft configuration provider.
    3. In the customized **Model mapping** ER configuration that you created in the previous step, redefine the model mapping data source so that it's configured as **$RRG.$Section3.$data = '$dataCustom'** instead of **$RRG.$Section3.$data = LISTJOIN(@.'$dataStd', @.'$dataCustom')**.

- Extend the **VAT Declaration helper (RU)** class. (Use methods that start with **getSection3data**, such as **getSection3dataDomesticVAT**.) Or, in a similar manner, create alternative helper methods that calculate the required cells values.

    In this case, follow these steps:

    1. Create a customized **Model mapping** ER configuration. Derive it from the configuration that is provided by the Microsoft configuration provider.
    2. Redefine the **$RRG.$Section3.$data.$dataStd** data source element of the model mapping.

For more information about how to create a derived version of ER configurations to do customization, see [ER Upgrade your format by adopting a new, base version of that format](../../dev-itpro/analytics/tasks/er-upgrade-format.md).

For more information about how to define model mappings, see [Define ER model mappings and select data sources for them](../../dev-itpro/analytics/tasks/er-define-model-mapping-select-data-sources-2016-11.md).

## Application 1 to section 3

Application 1 contains information about fixed assets that are used in non-taxable activities. It's generated in the last reporting period of the calendar year and contains the restored VAT amount for the fixed asset that was calculated for the whole calendar year. Data for application 1 is generated based on VAT restoration journal entries.

Application 1 contains the following information:

- The name of the fixed asset (line 010)
- The date when the fixed asset was put into operation (line 030)
- The depreciation start date (line 040)
- The initial cost of the fixed asset (line 050)
- The incoming VAT amount that is related to the fixed asset and that was deducted (line 060)
- The year when VAT restoration begins, until the tenth year of depreciation for the fixed asset (line 070, column 1)
- The date when the fixed asset was first used in non-taxable operations (line 070, column 2)
- The percentage of revenue for non-taxable goods and export operations (line 070, column 3)
- The VAT amount that was restored for the fixed asset in a year (line 070, column 4)

## Sections for exports that are taxed at a rate of 0 percent

Before you generate the sections of the VAT declaration for exports that are taxed at a rate of 0 percent, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Tax \> Setup \> Sales tax \> VAT operation codes**, and create VAT operation codes for export trade.
2. Go to **Tax \> Indirect taxes \> Sales tax \> Sales tax codes**, and assign VAT operation codes to sales tax codes.

### Overview and example

Sections for export are generated based on the registration of export factures and on VAT restoration journal entries.<!-- For more information about how to process export transactions, see [Processing invoice factures for export trade]().-->

**Example**

- **January 2018:** Products are purchased, and two documents are received: Invoice V1 and Facture1.

    - Invoice V1/Facture1: 10 pieces for a total amount of 118,000 Russian rubles (RUB). This amount includes 18-percent VAT (18,000 RUB).

- **January 2018:** Incoming VAT is deducted for Facture1.

    - 82,600 RUB, which includes 18-percent VAT (12,600 RUB)

    Note that the incoming facture includes only some of the goods that were purchased by using Invoice V1.

- **April 2018:** Products are sold for export, at an exchange rate of 45 RUB to 1 US dollar (USD).

    - Invoice C1: 2 pieces at 600 USD = 27,000 RUB (The corresponding incoming VAT amount is 3,600 RUB.)
    - Invoice C2: 8 pieces at 2,400 USD = 108,000 RUB (The corresponding incoming VAT amount is 14,400 RUB.)

    In this example, September 2018 is the deadline for collecting all the documents for confirmation of export at a rate of 0 percent.

- **August 2018:** The export for Invoice C1 is confirmed before the deadline.
- **September 2018:** The export for Invoice C2 isn't confirmed before the deadline. Therefore, VAT for this invoice is calculated at the domestic VAT rate of 18 percent (108,000 × 18 percent = 19,440 RUB).

    The amount of the corresponding incoming VAT deduction for the unconfirmed export is 9,000 RUB.

- **November 2018:** Facture2 is received for the remaining goods that were purchased by using Invoice V1. Therefore, the incoming VAT deduction for the remaining part of Invoice V1 is posted.

    - 35,400 RUB, which includes 18-percent VAT (5,400 RUB) (This amount is for the goods that were purchased by using Invoice C2.)

For this example, the VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2018 will contain sections 4 and 6. The VAT declaration for the fourth quarter of 2018 will contain section 5.

The following sections provide more details about this example.

### Section 4 – Calculation of VAT amounts for export sales where a tax rate of 0 percent was confirmed during the period

Section 4 of the VAT declaration represents amounts for export factures if a rate of 0 percent was confirmed during the reporting period. Data is grouped by VAT operation code.

The following data is exported:

- The VAT operation code (line 010)
- The tax base (line 020)
- The deductible VAT amount from the purchase of items that are used in an export that was confirmed at a rate of 0 percent (line 030)
- Adjustment: The deductible VAT amount that was paid in previous periods when a rate of 0 percent wasn't yet confirmed (line 040)
- Adjustment: The restored VAT amount that was deducted in previous periods for an unconfirmed export (line 050)

If goods are returned, the following data is exported for corrections of amounts:

- The VAT operation code (line 060)
- The tax base (line 070)

**Example**

For the previous example, the following data will be present in section 4 of the VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2018.

| Requisite | Line | Value |
|---|---|---|
| VAT operation code | 010 | 1011410 (per the user setup for the appropriate sales tax code) |
| Tax base | 020| 27,000 |
| Deductible VAT amount from the purchase of items that are used in an export that was confirmed at a rate of 0 percent | 030 | 3,600 |

### Section 5 – Calculation of deductible VAT amounts for the reporting period, for export sales where a tax rate of 0 percent was either confirmed or unconfirmed in previous periods

Section 5 of the VAT declaration represents VAT amounts that are deductible in the reporting period, for export sales where a rate of 0 percent was either confirmed or unconfirmed in previous periods. (In other words, this section represents "later" deductions of VAT amounts.) Data is grouped by the period when the corresponding export was declared, and also by VAT operation code.

The following data is exported:

- The year when the corresponding export was declared (line 010)
- The code for the reporting period when the corresponding export was declared (line 020)
- The VAT operation code (line 030)
- The tax base from the purchase of items that are used in a confirmed export (line 040)
- The deductible VAT amount from the purchase of items that are used in a confirmed export (line 050)
- The tax base from the purchase of items that are used in an unconfirmed export (line 060)
- The deductible VAT amount from the purchase of items that were used in an unconfirmed export (line 070)

**Example**

For the earlier example, the following data will be present in section 5 of the VAT declaration for the fourth quarter of 2018.

| Requisite | Line | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Year when the corresponding export was declared | 010 | 2018 |
| Code for the reporting period when the corresponding export was declared | 020 | 23 (period code for the third quarter) |
| VAT operation code | 030 | 1011410 |
| Tax base from the purchase of items that are used in an unconfirmed export | 060 | 108,000 |
| Deductible VAT amount from the purchase of items that are used in an unconfirmed export | 070 | 5,400 |

### Section 6 – Calculation of VAT amounts for export sales where a tax rate of 0 percent should have been confirmed during the period but wasn't confirmed

Section 6 of the VAT declaration represents amounts for export factures if a rate of 0 percent wasn't confirmed, and if the deadline expired during the reporting period. Data is grouped by VAT operation code.

The following data is exported:

- The VAT operation code (line 010)
- The tax base (line 020)
- The payable VAT amount that is calculated from the tax base for an unconfirmed export (line 030)
- The deductible VAT amount from the purchase of items that are used in an unconfirmed export (line 040)

If goods are returned, the following data is exported for corrections of amounts:

- The VAT operation code (line 070)
- The tax base of the return of goods (line 080)
- The VAT amount of the return of goods that is decreasing the VAT amount payable (line 090)
- Adjustment: The VAT amount, from the purchase of items that are used in an export, that was previously deducted and must be restored for the return of goods (line 100)

For the earlier example, the following data will be present in section 6 of the VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2018.

| Requisite | Line | Value |
|---|---|---|
| VAT operation code | 010 | 1011410 (per the user setup for the appropriate sales tax code) |
| Tax base | 020 | 108,000 |
