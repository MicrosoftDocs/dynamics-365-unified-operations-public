## Set up the depreciation start date for vehicle and realty assets

Use the **Depreciation groups** page to set up the start date for depreciation of fixed assets of the **Realty** and **Vehicle** types.

You can specify that the calculation of depreciation should be based on the registration date of the asset. If an asset is registered after it's put into operation, depreciation is calculated from the first day of the month of registration. If an asset is registered before it's put into operation, depreciation is calculated from the first day of the month after the asset is put into operation.

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Depreciation groups**.
2. Create a depreciation group, and enter the required details.
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Depreciation start date** field, select **Date of the registration** to specify that the registration date of a fixed asset should be used as the depreciation start date.

## Specify the registration date for vehicle and realty assets

4. On the **Technical information** FastTab, in the **Date of the registration** field, select the registration date of the fixed asset.
