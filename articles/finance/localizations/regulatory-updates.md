# Regulatory updates

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic lists the regulatory updates that are planned and released in Dynamics 365 Finance supported localizations. Delivery timelines might change, and projected functionality might be different or might not be released. For more information, see [Microsoft policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007332). 

Regulatory updates are features that are implemented to support new or changed country-specific legislation. For additional information about planned and released country-specific features, refer to the [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform release plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/index).

Microsoft strives to implement new regulatory requirements as early as possible. The actual delivery date depends on the law announcement date, availability of the requirement details from the local authorities, the availability of the validation tools, and on the size and complexity of the change.

We plan to deliver regulatory updates in One Version service updates that are released in time for customers to update and be ready for the enforcement date (for transactional regulatory updates), or for the first mandatory reporting deadline (for regulatory updates related to reporting). Customers and partners can preview the new regulatory updates in the Preview Early Adoption Program (PEAP).

In case of late announcement dates, late availability of requirement details or validation tools, or exceptionally large and complex changes, it might not be possible to make a regulatory update available by the General Availability date of a monthly update. In these cases, the regulatory update will be shipped as hot fixes for relevant available monthly updates.

Regulatory updates that are released as part of the monthly updated are indicated by release version only. Regulatory updates that are delivered either as hot fixes or as part of a release preview can be identified through the abbreviations HF and PEAP, respectively. 

For the latest regulatory update plans, refer to the following table.
