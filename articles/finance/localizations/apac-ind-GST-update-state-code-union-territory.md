To make the India localization solution for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance available, you must complete the following master data setup:

- Define a business vertical.
- Update the state code and union territory.
- Create a Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN) master.
- Define GSTINs for the legal entity, warehouse, vendor, or customer masters.
- Define Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes and Service Accounting Codes (SACs).
- Create main accounts for the GST posting type.
- Create a tax settlement period.
- Attach the GSTIN to a tax registration group.

Follow these steps to update the state code and union territory.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Global address book** \> **Addresses** \> **Address setup**.
2. On the **State/province** tab, select a state.
3. In the **State code** field, enter a value.
4. Set the **Union territory** option to **Yes** to identify the state as a union territory.
5. Select **Close**.
