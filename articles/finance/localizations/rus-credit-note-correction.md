### Post free text invoices as credit corrections

2. Select an existing free text invoice for an item that was returned.
3. On the **Invoice lines** FastTab, add an invoice line that has either a positive invoice amount or a negative invoice amount, depending on the type of correction.
4. Select **Post** to open the **Post free text invoice** dialog box.
5. Set the **Credit correction** option to **Yes**, and then select **OK** to post the invoice. This invoice has either a positive amount sign or a negative amount sign, depending on the direction of the correction. If the invoice amount is positive, you receive a message that states that the parameter for credit correction is activated.

Use the **Mark** check box to select the invoice and invoice lines, and then select **OK**. Lines are created that are identical to the invoice lines, but they have the opposite amount sign.

Then, on the **Posting invoice** page, set the **Credit correction** option to **Yes**, and post the invoice.
