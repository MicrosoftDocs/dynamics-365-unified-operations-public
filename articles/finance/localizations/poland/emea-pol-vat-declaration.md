# Support for multiple VAT registration numbers in the VAT return of Poland (JPK-V7)

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

As of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.29, the JPK-V7 feature lets you file a value-added tax (VAT) return for [multiple VAT registrations](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md).

For more information about how to set up and use the JPK-V7 feature in Finance, see [VAT declaration with registers (JPK-V7, VDEK)](../poland/emea-pol-vdek.md).

If you want to report a VAT return of Poland from a legal entity that has a primary address outside Poland, we recommend that you use the [Tax Calculation](../global/global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md) service, and that you enable the [Support multiple VAT registration numbers](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md) feature in the **Feature management** workspace.
