# Get started with Electronic invoicing for Poland

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information that will help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Poland. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) and in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. These steps complement the steps that are described in [Set up Electronic invoicing](../global/e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the procedures in this article, complete the following prerequisites:

- The legal entity must be registered as a taxpayer in Poland and must have a valid tax identification number (*Numer identyfikacji podatkowej*, or NIP).
- A valid certificate for digital signing must be obtained from the appropriate authorities.
- Become familiar with Electronic invoicing as it's described in [Electronic invoicing overview](../global/e-invoicing-service-overview.md).
- Sign up for RCS, and set up Electronic invoicing. For more information, see the following articles:

    - [Sign up for and install the Electronic Invoicing service](../global/e-invoicing-sign-up-install.md)

8. Save your changes, and complete the derived configuration.
9. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
10. On the **Integration channels** tab, in the **Channels** section, in the **Channel** field, enter the same import channel name that you created earlier.
11. In the **Channels** section, in the **Company** field, select a required legal entity. In the **Document context** field, select the configuration that you created earlier.
12. In the **Import sources** section, in the **Name** field, enter the same **OutputFile** name that you [created earlier](#OutputFile).
13. In the **Data entity name** field, select **Vendor invoice header**. In the **Model mapping** field, reference the **Vendor invoice import (PL)** configuration.
14. Select **Save**, and close the page.

### Configure Finance business data

You must configure the following types of master data to provide a match for incoming electronic invoices:

- Vendors
- Products
- Units

#### Vendors 
 
1. Go to **Accounts payable** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**, and select a vendor.
2. On the **Invoice and delivery** FastTab, in the **Tax exempt number** field, enter a valid value. The vendor's tax exempt number is used to identify the vendor during the import process for incoming electronic invoices. If no vendor that has matching data is found in the system, the import process fails, and a related error message is shown.

#### Products

1. Go to **Product information management** \> **Products** \> **Released products**, and select a product.
2. On the Action Pane, on the **Purchase** tab, in the **Related information** group, select **External item description**.
3. In the **Vendor relation** field, select the vendor or vendor group that the product's external identification is being set up for.
4. In the **External item number** field, enter the identification number of the product for a specific vendor or the group of vendors. External item numbers are used to identify the product during the import process for incoming electronic invoices. If no product that has matching criteria is found in the system, the import process fails, and a related error message is shown.

#### Units

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Units** \> **Units**.
2. Select a unit, and then select **External codes**.
3. On the **External codes** page, in the **Overview** section, in the **Code** field, enter a code that corresponds to the selected unit.
4. In the **Value** section, in the **Value** field, enter the external code to match with the unit codes from incoming electronic invoices during the import process.

    > [!NOTE]
    > External unit codes make sense only if incoming electronic invoices contain explicitly defined units. Otherwise, you can skip step 4. 

### Receive electronic invoices

Follow these steps to receive electronic invoices.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Electronic documents** \> **Receive electronic documents**.
2. Select **OK**, and then close the page.

During the import process, the system tries to automatically match incoming electronic vendor invoices with existing confirmed purchase orders. 

If no purchase order is found, the system raises a warning but continues to import the products on invoice lines as **Non-stock** items. Therefore, it expects that the products belong to an item model group where the **Stocked product** checkbox is cleared in the inventory policy.

If no related **Non-stock** products exist, the system tries to import invoice lines by referring to a default item. The default item must be configured in the system as a released product where the code is defined exactly as **DEFAULT\_ITEM**, and the product must belong to an item model group where the **Stocked product** checkbox is cleared in the inventory policy. If no default item is configured in the system, the import process fails, and a related error message is shown.

To view the receipt logs for electronic invoices, go to **Organization administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Electronic documents** \> **Electronic document receipt log**.

To view successfully received invoices, go to **Accounts payable** \> **Invoices** \> **Pending vendor invoices**.
