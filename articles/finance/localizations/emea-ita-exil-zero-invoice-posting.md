# Posting invoices with zero amount

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In Italy, financial transactions for invoices that have a total amount of 0 (zero) must be posted.

## Prerequisites

Before you can post financial transactions for invoices that have a total amount of 0 (zero), the following prerequisites must be met:

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.
- In the **Feature management** workspace, turn on the **Posting invoices with zero amount** feature. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Posting invoices that have an amount of 0 (zero)

The Posting invoices with zero amount feature applies to invoices that are created in the **Accounts receivable** and **Accounts payable** modules.

When invoices that have an amount of 0 (zero) are posted, the system creates customer/vendor transactions and voucher transactions.
