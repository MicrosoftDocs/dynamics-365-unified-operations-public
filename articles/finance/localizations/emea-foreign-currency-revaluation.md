3. Close the page.
4. Select **General ledger** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Currency** &gt; **Currency exchange rates**. On the **Currency exchange rates** page, you can define the exchange rate between two currencies or a currency pair.
5. When you've finished, close the page.
6. Select **General ledger** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Ledger**. In the **Unrealized gain** and **Unrealized loss** fields, select the main account that the exchange rates are posted for.
7. Close the page.
8. Select **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Periodic tasks** &gt; **Foreign currency revaluation**.
9. In the **On date** field, select the revaluation date or adjustment date.
10. In the **From currency** field, select the current currency code. In the **To currency** field, select the currency that the adjustment should be made to.
11. Select **Records to include** &gt; **Filter** to find the bank account, and then select **OK**.
12. On the **Foreign currency revaluation** page, select **OK**. The adjustment for the bank account transactions on the selected date is calculated.

> In the general ledger, you can view two separate transactions: one for the accounting currency and one for the reporting currency.
