## Import ER configurations from the repository

The process of submitting electronic documents to the Electronic Invoicing service requires the generation of a message in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. This message must be in a unified structure that corresponds to the structure of the Electronic reporting (ER) invoice model and metadata (*context*). Because the message is generated by ER, its structure is customizable and flexible.

Before you can submit documents to Electronic invoicing and process responses, you must import ER configurations from the repository and define them in parameters.

To set up, adjust, or review electronic documents directly in your Finance or Supply Chain Management environment, complete the following procedures.

1. In the **Globalization Studio** workspace, select the **Electronic reporting** tile.
1. In the **Configuration providers** section, select the **Microsoft** configuration provider, and then select **Repositories**.
1. Select the repository of the **Dataverse** type, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Open**.
1. Import the following ER models:

    - **Customer invoice context model**
    - **Invoice model**
    - **Fiscal documents** (for Brazilian scenarios, if required)
    - **Retail channel data** (for Saudi Arabian retail-specific scenarios, if required)
    - **Response message model**

1. Verify that the following mapping configurations were automatically imported. If they weren't, import them, and then close the page.

    - **Invoice model mapping**
    - **Fiscal documents mapping** (for Brazilian scenarios, if required)
    - **Advance invoice model mapping** (for Polish scenarios, if required)
    - **Retail fiscal document mapping** (for Saudi Arabian retail-specific scenarios, if required)

## Set up Electronic document parameters

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
1. On the **Electronic document** tab, above the **Electronic reporting** grid, select **Add**.
1. Depending on the scenarios that you want to support, enter the following information in the grid, and then save your changes.

    | Table name | Document context | Electronic document model mapping | Features that it's required for |

If you derive a configuration from the configuration that's mentioned in the preceding table, define the new configuration.

To set up the rules to process responses from the Electronic Invoicing service, and to update Finance and Supply Chain Management data based on invoices that are processed by the service, set up response types. In most scenarios, this setup is country/region-specific. Therefore, we recommend that you follow the country/region-specific instructions. For more information, see [Availability of Electronic invoicing features by country or region](e-invoicing-country-specific-availability.md).

## Create a Key Vault reference

1. On the **Electronic document parameters** page, on the **Electronic Invoicing** tab, on the **Key Vault settings** FastTab, select **Key Vault parameters**.
1. On the **Key Vault parameters** page, select **New** to create a Key Vault reference.
1. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the Key Vault reference.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a description.
1. In the **Key Vault URI** field, paste the Key Vault URI from the key vault (`https://<your key vault>.vault.azure.net/`). For more information, see [Create an Azure key vault in the Azure portal](gs-e-invoicing-create-azure-key-vault-azure-portal.md).
1. In the **Certificates** section, select **Add**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the storage account secret or certificate. This name should match the name of the Key Vault secret that holds the shared access signature (SAS) token of the storage account. For more information, see [Create an Azure storage account in the Azure portal](gs-e-invoicing-create-azure-storage-account-azure-portal.md).
1. In the **Description** field, enter a description.
1. In the **Type** field, select either **Secret** or **Certificate**, depending on what you're configuring.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In some scenarios, you must use public certificates that have the .cer file name extension. However, Key Vault doesn't support importing and storing certificates of this type as Key Vault certificates. In these scenarios, you should save the .cer file as a Base-64-encoded X.509 (.CER) string. Then, in a Key Vault secret, store the string that appears between the **BEGIN CERTIFICATE** line and the **END CERTIFICATE** line in the file. In the service environment, you should still create a reference to the Key Vault record and set the **Type** field to **Certificate**.
    >
    > Alternatively, use the following PowerShell script to generate a Base-64 string of the .cer certificate file.
    > 
    > ```powershell
    > $FilePath = ''
    > $Cer = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($FilePath)
    > $BinCert = $Cer.GetRawCertData()
    > $Base64Cert = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($BinCert)
    > echo $Base64Cert
    > ```

1. If your specific scenarios require a chain of certificates to apply digital signatures or establish a secure (Secure Sockets Layer \[SSL\]) connection to external web services, create a chain of certificates where the certificates are in the following order: *Root certificates* \> *Intermediate certificates* \> *End-user certificates*. Root certificate authorities (CAs) are a trusted source of certificates. Intermediate CA certificates are bridges that link the end-user certificates to the root CA certificates. To create and set up a chain of certificates, follow these steps:

    1. On the Action Pane, select **Chain of certificates**.
    1. Select **New** to create a chain of certificates.
    1. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the chain of certificates.
    1. In the **Description** field, enter a description.
    1. In the **Certificates** section, select **Add** to add a certificate to the chain.
    1. Use the **Up** or **Down** button to change the position of the certificate in the chain. Keep the CA root certificate at the top of the list and the end-user certificate at the bottom.
    1. Save the data, and close the **Chain of certificates** page.

1. Save the data, and close the **Key Vault parameters** page.
1. In the **Key Vault** field, select the key vault that you created in previous steps.
1. In the **Storage SAS token secret** field, select the name of the storage account secret that must be used to authenticate access to the storage account.

### Configure number sequences

If your scenarios require number sequences (for example, in file names), you can use number sequences that are used either across Globalization features or for a specific Globalization feature. After a number sequence is defined, you can use it in variables and processing pipelines. To track the use of a number sequence, look for a value in the **Current Value** field and a selected **In use** checkbox on the **Number sequences** FastTab on the **Electronic Invoicing** tab of the **Electronic document parameters** page.

To create a number sequence, select **New** on the **Number sequences** FastTab. Then enter a name and description.

To delete a number sequence if it's no longer used, select **Delete**.

## Inactivate legacy Electronic invoicing functionality

To inactivate old (legacy) ER functionality for some features, and to activate additional functionality in Finance and Supply Chain Management for some country/region-specific scenarios, enable the corresponding feature on the **Features** tab of the **Electronic document parameters** page.

When you enable a feature in the list, the legacy functionality is inactivated for the corresponding country or region and feature name.
