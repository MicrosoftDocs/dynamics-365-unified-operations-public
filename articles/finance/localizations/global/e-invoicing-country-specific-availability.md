# Availability of Electronic Invoicing Service features by country or region

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The availability of Electronic invoicing Service globalization features depends on the country or region where you're located. Although some features are generally available, others are still in preview.

> [!NOTE]
> This article is related only to the globalization features introduced in the scope of the Electronic Invoicing Service. This article doesn't cover other approaches for supported e-Invoicing capabilities for some countries/regions designed based on built-in X++ code and the Electronic Messaging framework.
> For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing](gs-e-invoicing-service-overview.md) and [Electronic messaging](../../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We were planning to transition NF-e/NFS-e and CFDI to our Electronic Invoicing service. For quite a while, the features and formats for NF-e/NFS-e have been in preview in Brazil, and those for CFDI have been in preview in Mexico. However, because of a lack of interest in adoption and transition to the new approach, we are still evaluating the timing of the switch to the Electronic Invoicing service platform in those countries/regions. The format of these documents won't contain the latest compliance changes that were published since the preview release. In the meantime, we recommend continuing that you use our built-in X++ implementations in Brazil and Mexico. **These implementations are kept up to date with the legislation.** For more information, see [Brazil NF-e process overview](../brazil/latam-bra-nf-e-process.md) and [Electronic invoices (CFDI)](../iberoamerica/latam-mex-CFDI-electronic-invoices.md).
