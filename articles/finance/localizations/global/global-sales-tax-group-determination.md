# Sales tax applicability and sales tax group determination logic

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains the logic for determining sales tax applicability and sales tax groups in the tax feature setup.

## Matching logic

The applicability logic tries to match the condition that includes the most input fields. Each field that has a value has a *weight* of 10. A condition that has a higher total weight has a higher priority.

### Example

The following example shows how the matching logic works.

The **Tax group applicability** tab is configured as shown in the following table.

| Business process | Currency | Item code | Tax group | Weight |
|------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Purchase         | EUR      |           | TG\_A     | 20     |
| Purchase         | EUR      | D0001     | TG\_B     | 30     |

For the first line in the table, two input fields are set. Therefore, the line has a weight of 20. For the second line, three fields are set. Therefore, the line has a weight of 30.

When sales tax is calculated for a purchase order that has the EUR currency and item D0001, Tax Calculation uses the condition that has a higher weight. Therefore, it uses the second line in the table.

## Adjust execution sequence

In the 10.0.28 update, you can adjust the execution sequence of the applicability rules which are equally weighted.

> [!NOTE]
> In RCS, the **Tax calculation service feature setup new UI** feature must be enabled in Feature management to make the **Adjust execution sequence** button visible in the **Applicability rules** tables.

### Example

The following example shows how the **Adjust execution sequence** button works.

The **Tax group applicability** tab is configured as shown in the following table.

| Business process | Currency | Item code | Tax group | Weight |
|------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Purchase         | EUR      | &nbsp;    | TG\_A     | 20     |
| Purchase         | &nbsp;   | D0001     | TG\_B     | 20     |

Per the matching logic, the rules in the table are equally weighted. If you purchase item **D0001** with the transaction currency **EUR**, the first rule (Tax group **TG\_A**) is applied.

Complete the following steps to adjust the rule which is applied.

1. Select **Adjust execution sequence**.
2. Select the second rule, and the select **Move up**. 
3. Select **Complete**.

Now, the second rule (Tax group **TG\_B**) is moved above the first one and would be applied first.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't move a rule above or under another rule which has a different **Weight**.


## Sales tax group and item sale tax group determination logic

When a document line is created on a business document, such as a sales order, purchase order, or vendor invoice, the **Sales tax group** and **Item sales tax group** fields are set to the values from the master data. Then, when tax is calculated, the fields are updated according to the conditions that are configured in the Tax feature setup on the **Tax group applicability** and **Item tax group applicability** tabs.

If no applicability rule is configured for the tax group or item tax group in the Tax feature setup, Tax Calculation uses the default rules from the master data in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

> [!NOTE]
> The sales tax group and item sales tax group must be created and maintained in the Tax calculation feature.

## Override sales tax
You can update the tax groups that Tax Calculation determined, without having to reconfigure the Tax feature. For example, you might have to update the tax groups because the rule is incorrectly set up, or because some exception to the rule is required. By setting the **Override sales tax** option to **Yes** on the line details page for a document line, you can select the required sales tax group and item sales tax group.

The tax codes are calculated based on the intersection of the tax codes that are defined on the **Tax group** and **Item tax group** tabs in the Tax feature setup.
In Finance, the value of the **Source** field indicates that the tax groups were synchronized from the Tax feature setup.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Sales tax group** or **Item sales tax group** field is left blank, and the **Override sales tax** option is set to **Yes**, the line won't be sent to the Tax calculation service for processing.

The **Override sales tax** checkbox is added to the **Customer** and **Vendor** master data on the **Invoice and delivery** FastTab. The checkbox is also added to the Sales order, Purchase order, Free text invoice header, and to the line level of those documents.

Here is a process that combines tax code determination logic with override sales tax:

#### Scenario 1: Override sales tax = Yes

The flow that combines tax code determination logic with override sales tax yes.

:::image type="content" source="../media/OverrideSalesTax_Yes.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the flow that combines tax code determination logic with override sales tax yes."::: 

#### Scenario 2: Override sales tax = No and applicability rule can be matched

The flow that combines tax code determination logic with override sales tax no and matched applicability rules.

:::image type="content" source="../media/OverrideSalesTax_No1.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the flow that combines tax code determination logic with override sales tax no and matched applicability rules."::: 

#### Scenario 3: Override sales tax = No and applicability rule can't be matched

The flow that combines tax code determination logic with override sales tax no and applicability rules mismatch.

### Update order lines

You can bulk update lines if the **Override sales tax** checkbox is changed on the header level and is added to the **Update order lines** parameters pages for Sales order, Sales quotation, and Purchase order.
For example, if the option is set to **Prompt**, when the **Override sales tax** is changed on the header of the document, the dialog box opens, and you can select whether the document lines should be updated.

> [!NOTE]
> Header-level and line-level charges inherit the **Override sales tax** option from the header or line of the document, respectively.
> 
> Current limitation:
> When updating **Override sales tax** checkbox on a header or line level the respective charges do not inherit this checkbox in case the charges were already created.

### Reverse charge applicability rules 

For information about the configuration for reverse charge rules, see [Set up reverse charge rules](emea-reverse-charge.md#reverse-charge-rules).

When the document lines meet the reverse charge rules that are configured in Finance, the **Override sales tax** checkbox is set to **Yes** for the affected lines. The default value for **Sales tax group** comes from the **Purchase order sales tax group** or **Sales order sales tax group** field, respectively. These fields are specified on the **General ledger parameters** page, on the **Reverse charge** tab. For more information about these fields, see [Set up default parameters](emea-reverse-charge.md#set-up-default-parameters).

> [!NOTE]
> For reverse charges, the sales tax groups and item sales tax groups also must be created and maintained in the Tax feature setup.
