# Electronic invoicing coverage for supported and planned countries and regions

This article describes the current geographical coverage for electronic invoicing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. It also describes known plans for upcoming electronic invoicing implementations.

Electronic invoicing, or e-invoicing, is the process of sending and receiving invoices in a digital format. E-invoicing is rapidly becoming an important part of business processes and an essential part of compliance with the global and country/region-specific regulatory requirements for both buyers and suppliers.

E-invoicing has several advantages over traditional paper-based invoicing. Here are some examples:

- It reduces errors and disputes by eliminating manual data entry and validation.
- It increases cash flow and visibility by speeding up the invoice approval and payment cycle.
- It lowers operational costs by saving time, paper, postage, and storage space.
- It improves customer satisfaction and retention by offering convenience and flexibility.
- It supports environmental sustainability by reducing paper waste and carbon footprint.

Microsoft monitors changes to legislative requirements in the e-invoicing area for all supported countries and regions, and delivers regulatory updates in a timely manner. When we extend geographical coverage, we prioritize e-invoicing as one of the most important requirements.

The next section contains detailed information about out-of-box e-invoicing functionality for countries and regions that are already supported. It includes information about upcoming regulatory changes and plans for new country/region implementations.

## Electronic invoicing coverage

> [!NOTE]
> Delivery timelines for planned implementations that are mentioned in the following table might change. In addition, projected functionality might not be released at all, for various reasons. For more information, see [Microsoft policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007332).
