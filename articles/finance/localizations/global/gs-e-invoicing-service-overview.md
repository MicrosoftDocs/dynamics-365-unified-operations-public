Electronic invoicing for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is a hyper-scalable multitenant service that enables configurable processing of electronic invoices and configurable electronic documents exchange.

- Enhanced traceability of document history
- A shorter implementation cycle
- Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO)
