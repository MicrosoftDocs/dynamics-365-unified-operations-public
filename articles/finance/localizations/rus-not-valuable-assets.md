# Not valuable fixed assets (NVFAs) (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Low-value, high-wear items that are used in the workplace can be tracked and accounted for as special types of fixed assets that are known as *not valuable fixed assets* (NVFAs). NVFAs are items that have a cost that is less than the specified cost limit. The full cost of NVFAs should be written off for depreciation in the first month of use.

When you purchase fixed assets, regular fixed assets and NVFAs are divided based on the purchase price (cost). The value that you set for the **Max cost of the NVFA** field when you [set up Fixed assets parameters for NVFAs](#set-up-fixed-assets-parameters-for-nvfas) determines the cost that distinguishes regular fixed assets and NVFAs.

After you purchase and register NVFAs, you can perform the following tasks:

- Automate the process of putting NVFAs into operation and adding them to subsequent depreciation transactions.
- Print the MB-2, MB-4, and MB-8 reports.

## Set up Fixed assets parameters for NVFAs 

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Fixed assets parameters**.
2. In the **Base value model** field, select the default base value model.
3. In the **Max cost of the NVFA** field, enter the maximum limit for the cost of the NVFA.
4. In the **NVFA inventory profile** field, select the inventory profile for the NVFA.
5. On the **Number sequences** tab, in the **Number sequence code** field, select the number sequence code for the **NVFA inventory number** and **NVFA issue journal number** reference types.
6. On the **Document** tab, on the **Document types** FastTab, in the **Number sequence code** field, select the number sequence code for the **NVFA Act on disposal (No. MB-4)** and **NVFA Act on writing-off No. MB-8)** document types.

## Set up fixed asset groups for NVFA

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **FA groups**.
2. On the **FA groups** page, create a record, and fill in the fields. In the **Type of group** field, select **NVFA**.

## Set up the identification of fixed asset groups for NVFAs

1. Go to **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Working clothes/Special riggings/NVFA** \> **Identification of FA groups**.
2. On the **Condition for FA group identification** page, create a record, and fill in the fields.
3. Select **Compliance**, and specify how the item is related to a fixed asset group.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The system uses this setting to fill in the **FA group** and **Lifetime** fields on the **Working clothes/Special riggings/NVFA issue journal lines** page. For more information, see [Generate NVFA records, putting into operation transactions, and depreciation transactions for NVFAs](#generate-nvfa-records-putting-into-operation-transactions-and-depreciation-transactions-for-nvfas).

## Set up inventory dimensions for NVFAs

Use this procedure to set up inventory dimensions for NVFAs, working clothes, and special rigging items.

1. Go to **Product information management** \> **Setup** \> **Dimensions and variant groups** \> **Tracking dimension groups**.
2. Create a dimension group.
3. For the **Batch number** dimension, select the **Active** check box to enable batch accounting for NVFAs. Items that have different prices are accounted for in different batches.
4. Also select the **Primary stocking** and **Financial inventory** check boxes for the **Batch number** dimension.
5. For the **Serial number** dimension, select the **Active** check box. This dimension is used when the asset is put into operation.
6. Also select the **Blank receipt allowed** and **Blank issue allowed** check boxes for the **Serial number** dimension. When these check boxes are selected, you can perform inventory operations without having to specify a serial number.
7. For the **Inventory profile** dimension, select the **Active** and **Primary stocking** check boxes to enable inventory profile accounting for NVFAs.

## Set up items as NVFAs

1. Go to **Product information management** \> **Products** \> **Released products**.
2. Create a new item, or double-click an existing item to open the item record.
3. Select **Set up** \> **Dimension groups** to set up storage and tracking dimension groups for the item.
4. In the **Item model group** field, select the item model group.
5. In the **FA group** field, select a fixed asset group that has the **NVFA** group type for the item.

## Set up officials for the NVFA Statement of writing-off (No. MB-8)

5. In the **Item number** field, select an item number.
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity of the item that is being ordered.
7. In the **Unit price** field, enter the purchase price for an item unit. If the purchase price of a fixed asset is less than the value that is specified in the **Max cost of the NVFA** field on the **Fixed assets parameters** page, excluding the sales tax value, the item is considered an NVFA. In this case, the **Inventory profile** field on the **Product** tab of the **Line details** FastTab is automatically set to the value that is entered on the **Fixed assets parameters** page.
8. Post the vendor invoice.

> [!NOTE]
> If the system defines the item on the purchase line as an NVFA, you should not specify a fixed asset inventory number for that line in the purchase order.

## Generate NVFA records, putting into operation transactions, and depreciation transactions for NVFAs
