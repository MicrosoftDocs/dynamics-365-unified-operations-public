[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Miscellaneous charges can be allocated to the cost of goods, either works or services, that are purchased or sold. Russian localization has two additional methods to allocate charges:

- **According to the gross weight** – Charges are allocated equally, according to the gross weight of the items that are received. This amount is equal to the quantity in the inventory transaction multiplied by the **Gross weight** field from the inventory item card.
- **According to the volume** – Charges are allocated equally, according to the volume of the items that are received. This amount is equal to the quantity in the inventory transaction multiplied by the **Volume** field from the inventory item card.

## Allocate charges according to weight or volume of goods

1. Select **Accounts payable \> Purchase orders \> All purchase orders** or **Accounts receivable \> Orders \> All sales orders.**
2. Create a new order.
3. In the **Charges allocation** field, select one of the new allocation methods:

    - **Gross weight:** Allocate charges according to the gross weight.
    - **Volume:** Allocate charges according to the volume.

4. Specify other details and post the sales order as usual.
