# VAT declaration for Indonesia 

This article explains how to set up and generate the value-added tax (VAT) return form for legal entities in Indonesia. 
This form is referred as *SPT Masa PPN (Surat Pemberitahuan Masa Pajak Pertambahan Nilai)*. 
Corporate taxpayers should issue it to report the calculated amount of tax so that they can report VAT (PPN) and Luxury Goods Sales Tax (PPNnBM) that are owed. 

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance supports generation of the **SPT Masa PPN (Pajak Pertambahan Nilai)** in Excel format that includes the following pages:

- **11. Other Output Tax Documents** – reports VAT collected using documents other than standard tax invoices (for example, customs or specific government documents).
- **12. Other Input Tax Documents** – records VAT paid that's creditable based on documents other than standard tax invoices.
- **13. Return of Other Output Tax Documents** – declares corrections or returns of previously reported other output VAT documents.
- **14. Return of Other Input Tax Documents** – declares corrections or returns of previously reported other input VAT documents.
- **15. Output Tax Invoice** – lists VAT collected through standard e-Faktur (tax invoices) issued to buyers.
- **16. Return of Input Tax Invoice** – records VAT invoice returns or cancellations that reduce previously credited input tax.

## Prerequisites

The primary address of the legal entity must be in Indonesia.

In the **Feature management** workspace, enable the **Enable credit invoicing for vendor invoices** feature. For more information about how to enable features, see [Feature management overview](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Upload Electronic reporting configurations

Implementation of the VAT return form for Indonesia is based on Electronic reporting (ER) configurations. For more information about the capabilities and concepts of configurable reporting, see [Electronic reporting](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md).

In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, import the latest version **VAT Declaration Excel (ID)** ER format from the repository. This format is based on the **Tax declaration model** configuration and uses the **Tax declaration model mapping** configuration. Model and model mapping configurations are automatically imported. Learn more about how to import ER configurations in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](/dynamics365/finance/localizations/global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse).

## Set up application-specific parameters

Application-specific parameters of the **SPT Masa PPN** format in ER facilitate the mapping of your tax data to the required values that the report structure defines.
The application-specific parameters let you establish the criteria that define how the tax transactions are collected and calculated in **SPT Masa PPN** report when it's generated, based on the configuration of the sales tax code. Here are some of the available criteria:

- Sales tax group
- Item sales tax group
- Sales tax code
- Transaction classifier
- Exempt reason

You need enough transactional data to define values in **SPT Masa PPN** report. Therefore, set up enough sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups to differentiate tax transactions for the structure of in **SPT Masa PPN**.

1. On the **Lookups** FastTab, select a lookup field in the list. Detailed descriptions of all the lookup fields of the **SPT Masa PPN** format are provided after this procedure.
1. On the **Conditions** FastTab, define the required conditions, and specify the values in the **Lookup result** column.
1. As the last two lines, add lines that have the conditions **Not blank** and **Blank** where applicable.
1. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each additional lookup field.
1. When you set up all the lookup fields, select **Completed** in the **State** field, and save the configuration.
