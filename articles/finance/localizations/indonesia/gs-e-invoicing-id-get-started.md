# Get started with Electronic invoicing for Indonesia (preview)

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information that will help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Indonesia. It describes the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. It guides through the steps that you must follow in Finance to export sales invoices through the service, and to review the processing results and the status of invoices.

## Prerequisites

- Become familiar with Electronic invoicing. For more information, see [Electronic invoicing overview](../global/e-invoicing-service-overview.md).
- Sign up for RCS, and set up Electronic invoicing. For more information, see the following articles:

    - [Sign up for and install the Electronic Invoicing service](../global/e-invoicing-sign-up-install.md)
    - [Set up Azure resources for Electronic invoicing](../global/e-invoicing-set-up-azure-resources.md)
    - [Install the add-in for microservices in Lifecycle Services](../global/e-invoicing-install-add-in-microservices-lcs.md)
    - [Activate and setup integration with Electronic invoicing](../global/e-invoicing-activate-setup-integration.md)

## Configure Electronic invoicing features

1. In the **Globalization Studio** workspace, select the **Electronic invoicing** tile.
1. On the **Electronic invoicing features** page, verify that the **Indonesian electronic invoice (ID)** Electronic invoicing feature is selected.
1. On the **Versions** tab, verify that the **Draft** version is selected.
1. Import the Electronic invoicing feature to process invoice exports and importing vendor invoices.
1. Review the format configurations that are required to generate and export sales invoices.
1. Review or configure the actions in the processing pipeline that support the sales invoice export and import scenarios.
1. Publish the Electronic invoicing feature for export sales invoices and import vendor invoices.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the feature in the list, select **Synchronize**, and then repeat step 2.

When you import the **Indonesian electronic invoice (ID)** feature from the Dataverse repository, all the feature settings are imported. These settings include the configurations and actions of the processing pipeline.

### Create a new version of the Indonesian electronic invoice (ID) feature

You can create a new feature version by using your configuration provider.

1. In the **Globalization Studio** workspace, select the **Electronic Invoicing** tile.
1. On the **Electronic invoicing features** page, on the **Versions** tab, select **New**.

### Update the configuration version

1. In the **Globalization features** workspace, select the **Electronic Invoicing** tile.
1. On the **Electronic invoicing features** page, on the **Configurations** tab, select **Add** or **Delete** to manage the configuration versions.

When you create a new version, all configurations are inherited from the imported version of the Electronic invoicing feature. The following configurations are required to process invoices:

- Invoices issued (ID)
- eInvoice import (ID)

In the list, select a configuration version, and then select **Edit** or **View** to open the **Format designer** page, where you can edit or view the configuration.

You can review the configuration and customize it as you require. Use the **Format designer** page to edit and view the Electronic reporting (ER) format file configurations. For more information, see [Create electronic document configurations](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-configuration.md).

### Configure the application-specific parameters

> [!NOTE]
> When you set up application-specific parameters, check the connection on the **Connected applications** page. Go to the RCS home page, and select **Electronic reporting**. At the bottom of the page, select **Connected application** \> **Check connection**.

Before you begin, make sure that the **Invoices issued (ID)** ER format configuration is imported.

Follow these steps to begin the configuration.

1. In the **Globalization Studio** workspace, select the **Electronic reporting** tile, and then select the **Reporting configurations** tile.
1. On the **Configurations** page, select the **Invoices issued (ID)** format configuration.
1. On the **Configurations** menu, in the **Application specific parameters** section, selected **Setup**.

To enable the system to determine which sales tax code in Finance corresponds to the tax code for luxury goods (PPnBM) when invoices are exported, follow these steps to set the application-specific parameters for luxury sales tax.

1. In the **Lookups** grid, select the row for **TaxTypeLookup**.
1. In the **Conditions** grid, on the first line, set the **Lookup result** field to **PPnBM** and the **Sales tax code (TaxCode)** field to the sales tax code that's used for luxury tax in Finance.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can set up several sales tax codes for PPnBM and have several lines for them in the **Conditions** grid.

1. On the last line, set the **Lookup result** field to **Other** and the **Sales tax code (TaxCode)** field to **\*Not blank\***. These settings specify that the system should consider no other sales tax codes luxury tax.

To enable the system to determine which sales tax group in Finance corresponds to VAT-free reasons (transaction code 07, reasons 1 through 8) or VAT-exempt reasons (transaction code 08, reasons 1 through 5) when invoices are exported, follow these steps to set the application-specific parameters for those reasons.

1. In the **Lookups** grid, select the row for **VATFreeInfoLookup**.
1. In the **Conditions** grid, on the first line, set the **Lookup result** field from **1** through **8** for transaction code **07** and from **1** through **5** for transaction code **08**.
1. Set the **Tax group (TaxGroup)** field to the sales group that's used for exemption operations in Finance.
1. On the last line, set the **Lookup result** field to **Other** and the **Tax group (TaxGroup)** field to **\*Not blank\***. These settings specify that the system should consider no other sales tax groups exemption groups.
