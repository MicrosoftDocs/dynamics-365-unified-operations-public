[!include [banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This topic provides information that will help you get started with importing vendor invoices using the Electronic Invoicing service. It guides you through the configuration steps in Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS), Dynamics 365 Finance, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management that you must follow to receive electronic vendor invoices from the vendors.

## Set up vendor invoice import in RCS
To set up vendor invoice import in RCS, follow these steps:

1. Consult the list of [generally available Electronic invoicing features](e-invoicing-configuration-rcs.md#generally-available-features).
2. Select and import the Electronic invoicing feature. For more information, see [Import an Electronic invoicing feature from Microsoft configuration provider](e-invoicing-get-started.md#import-an-electronic-invoicing-feature-from-the-microsoft-configuration-provider).
3. Create an Electronic invoicing feature for your organization. For more information, see [Create an Electronic invoicing feature under your organization provider](e-invoicing-get-started.md#create-an-electronic-invoicing-feature-under-your-organization-provider).

## Configure an email account channel

Configure an email account channel if the Electronic invoicing feature you created imports electronic vendor invoices from attached files that are received by email.

1. In RCS, select the Electronic invoicing feature that you created. Make sure you select the version with a status of **Draft**.
2. On **Setups** tab, in the grid, select a feature setup, and then select **Edit**.
3. On the **Data channel** tab in the **Parameters** field group, in the **Data channel** field, enter the name of the channel. The channel name should be no more than ten characters.
4. In the **Server address** field, enter the email account provider. For example, the server address for **https://outlook.live.com/** is **imap-mail.outlook.com**.
5. In the **Server port** field, enter the port used by the email account provider. For example, the server port for **https://outlook.live.com/** is **993**.
6. In the **User name secret** field, enter the name of the Key vault secret that contains the ID of the email user account. This secret must be created in Azure key vault and setup in your service environment. 
7. In the **User password secret** field, enter the name of the Key vault secret that contains the password of the email user account.
8. Optional - Enter values in the **From filter**, **Subject filter**, and **Date filter** fields.
9. Enter the names of the mail box folders where mails will be:

    - Imported from: **Main folder**
    - Saved after successful processing: **Archive folder**
    - Saved after not successful processing: **Error folder** 
   You aren't required to create these folders in the mail box. The folders are created automatically after first e-invoice import and processing. 
   
10. In the **Attachments filter** field group, add the file filtering information. Only attachments that satisfy the defined filter are processed. For example, you can setup "\*.xml" for attachments with an xml extension. The name of the attachment is used in Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management during setup. 
11. On the **Applicability rules** tab, review and update the criteria as necessary. The **Channel** field must be equal to the **Data channel** provided earlier. For more information, see [Applicability rules](e-invoicing-configuration-rcs.md#applicability-rules).
12. Select **Save** and close the page.

### Configure a Microsoft SharePoint channel

Configure a Microsoft SharePoint channel if the Electronic invoicing feature imports electronic vendor invoices from files placed in SharePoint folders.

1. In RCS, select the Electronic invoicing feature that you created. Make sure you selected the **Version** with status **Draft**.
2. On **Setups** tab, in the grid, select a Feature setup and then select **Edit**.
3. On the **Data channel** tab, in the **Parameters** field group, select **SharePoint address** and enter the SharePoint URL.
4. Select **Server port** and enter the port used by the email account provider.
5. Select **Application Id** and enter the name of the Key vault secret that contains the ID of the SharePoint client.
6. Select **Application secret** and enter the name of the Key vault secret that contains the password of the SharePoint client.
7. Select **File filter**. Review and update the mask to filter the files that contain the electronic vendor invoice to import.
8. On the **Applicability rules** tab, review and update the criteria if necessary. For more information, see [Applicability rules](e-invoicing-configuration-rcs.md#applicability-rules).
9. Select **Save** and close the page

### Deploy an Electronic invoicing feature

## Receive electronic invoices

The Electronic Invoicing service performs two steps during invoice import from the data channels:

1. Accesses the mail box and reading e-mail.
2. Processes the emails. 
    
To perform these two steps, the client should call the service manually for each step. However, we recommend that you set up batch for receiving electronic documents.

To receive electonic invoices, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Periodic** > **Electronic documents** > **Receive electronic documents**.
2. Select **OK** and then close the page.


## View receive logs for electronic invoices

To view the receive logs for electronic invoices, go to **Organization administration** > **Periodic** > **Electronic documents** > **Electronic document receipt log**.
If you don't see successfully proccesed invoices, remove the table filter.
