# Cash flow management (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In a centralized payment organization, there are many legal entities for operations, and each operating legal entity manages information for its own invoices. Payments for all the operating legal entities are generated from a single legal entity, which is sometimes referred to as the Treasury legal entity or Treasury company.

A Treasury company is responsible for monitoring the flow of cash and liquidity movement across companies and cash positions (shortage and surplus), and for preventing corporate cash shortage in a timely manner.

Here are the main goals of a Treasury company:

- Get an accurate liquidity/cash flow forecast, and do analysis for the medium-term/short-term horizon.
- Manage payments daily by using payment schedule journals.
- Control the company's cash position.
- Maintain the company's cash flows through centralized control.

This topic provides a step-by-step example that shows the settings and user activities for cash flow management. 

> [!NOTE]
> The data set that is used in this topic is for demo purposes only. The codes that you use for ledger accounts, value-added tax (VAT), rates, and so on, should comply with the rules that are accepted in your company.

In this example, Contoso Retail RUS (RURT) is a subsidiary of an industrial holding company and does business as an operating legal entity. Contoso Entertainment Systems Russia (RUMF) is an internal bank of an industrial holding company and handles all payments.

The following table shows the stages of payment that a treasurer deals with during payment processing.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Business scenario</th>
<th>Payment cause</th>
<th>Payment stage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The company requests and confirms delivery of goods (that is, a purchase order that has a delivery schedule that is confirmed). A treasurer includes information about the expected payments (inflow or outflow) in the cash flow forecast by creating payment schedule journal of type "payment plan".
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Purchase order</li>
<li>Sales order</li>
<li>Free text invoice</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>Planned payment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The company receives the payment request (prepayment request, invoice, and so on) from a seller. The manager creates a payment request, which should be approved by the manager lead and a treasurer. The treasurer includes information about the expected and approved payments (inflow or outflow) in the cash flow forecast.
<blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> The Payment request and the associated functionality are available only if the <strong>Payment request</strong> license configuration key is turned on.</blockquote>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Vendor invoice</li>
<li>Prepayment invoice</li>
<li>Planned payment for confirmed purchase order</li>
<li>Customer return invoice</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>Payment request</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A treasurer generates and confirms the payment schedule journal (payment register). In this way, the company defines the list of payments that should be made by the bank/cash account.</td>
<td>Payment schedule journal (of the <strong>Payment register</strong> type)</td>
<td>Payment order</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The company receives the statement from a bank. This statement includes the authorized transactions (completed payments).</td>
<td>Bank statement</td>
<td>Completed payment</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

After you complete the example that is provided in this topic, you will be able to perform the following tasks:

- Configure parameters for cash flow management to support the new functionality.
- Process planned payments. Forecast transactions of incoming and outgoing payments are automatically created and updated based on purchase orders, sales orders, and free text invoices.
- If the **Payment request** license configuration key is turned on, process payment requests based on indebtedness to vendors, customers, and workers, and prepayment requirements from vendors. (The processing includes the creation, update, and approval of payment requests.)
- Process payment schedule journals for medium-term liquidity planning (payment plan) and daily payment management (payment register). Analyze cash deficit and surplus through payment schedule sheet balancing (the simulation function).
- Generate payments, based on an approved payment register, which is a type of payment schedule journal.

## Setup

### Set up the license configuration

1. Go to **System administration \> Setup \> License configuration**.
2. Under **Country/Regional specific features \> Russia**, select the **Cash flow management** check box.
3. If the organization plans to use payment requests, select the **Payment requests** check box.

### Optional: Set up an organization hierarchy for centralized payments

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Organizations \> Organization hierarchies**.
2. In the left pane, select **Centralized Payments**.

    ![Organization hierarchy for centralized payments](media/rus-org-hierarchy.jpg)

3. Select **View**.
4. On the **Hierarchy designer** page, create a hierarchy where **Contoso Entertainment Systems Russia** (**RUMF**) is the legal entity of the payment and **Contoso Retail RUS** (**RURT**) is the operating legal entity.

    ![Organization hierarchy designer](media/rus-org-hierarchy-designer.jpg)

5. Publish the new hierarchy.

### Set up a workflow for cash flow management 

1. Go to **Cash and bank management \> Setup \> Cash and bank management workflows**.
2. Select **New** to create a record.
3. Select the required workflow type: **Workflow type for payment requests approval** or **Payment schedule journal approval workflow**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Payment request type** page is available only if the **Payment request** license configuration key is turned on.

2. Select **New** to create a record.
3. Specify the payment priority.

    If a payment priority isn't specified for a payment request type, the lowest payment priority will be used for payment requests of that type. The payment priority for a payment request will be the higher of the payment priority of the party and the payment priority of the payment request type.

This step lets an organization determine which dimensions in the account structures that are associated with the chart of accounts (for legal entities in a centralized payment hierarchy) are available for cash flow management processing. For example, combinations of departments that have cost centers can be used for liquidity/cash flow forecast analysis.
3. On the **Default exchange rate type for forecast** FastTab, specify the default exchange rate type for forecasts. This value is used in payment plans when the currency of a payment source differs from the payment currency.

6. On the **Payment request re-approval** FastTab, in the **Amount to pay change** field, specify the system behavior if the amount to pay for a payment request is changed.

7. On the **Number sequences** tab, specify number sequence codes for the following references:

    - Payment request
    - Payment schedule journal

### Set up terms of payment

This setup is available only if the **Payment request** license configuration key is turned on.

## Planned payment processing

### Planned payments on purchase orders

A planned payment contains details about future payments: the amount, method of payment, payment account, payment priority, and cash discount amount.

The due date is calculated based on the **Confirmed delivery date** or **Delivery date** if the **Confirmed delivery date** isn't specified.

If a user posts an invoice, planned payments are recalculated. If a purchase order is fully invoiced, the purchase order won't have any planned payments.

If the **Payment request** license configuration key is turned on, a planned payment is created based on the financial dimensions from the purchase order lines. Otherwise, the planned payment is based on the financial dimensions from the purchase order header.

Planned payments are generated for a purchase order if a payment schedule is calculated, or if a user selects the **Planned payments** button.

This procedure should be completed in a subsidiary company.

If the **Payment request** license configuration key is turned on, a planned payment is created based on the financial dimensions from the sales order lines. Otherwise, the planned payment is based on the financial dimensions from the sales order header.

Planned payments are generated for a sales order if a payment schedule is calculated, or if a user selects the **Planned payments** button.

This step should be completed in a subsidiary company.

1. Go to **Accounts receivable \> Orders \> All sales orders**.
2. Create a sales order. On the sales order header, specify the terms of payments, payment schedule, method of payment, cash discount, and financial dimensions.
