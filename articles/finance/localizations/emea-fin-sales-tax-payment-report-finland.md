[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to set up and generate the sales tax report for legal entities in Finland.

For general information about how to set up the value-added tax (VAT) statement, see [VAT reporting for Europe](emea-vat-reporting.md).

## Set up the report layout for sales tax authorities

To generate the sales tax report in the correct format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the report layout for the sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, select the sales tax authority that will be used in the sales tax codes for the sales tax settlement period. Then, in the **Report layout** field, select **Finnish report layout**.

## Set up sales tax reporting codes for VAT reporting

Set up sales tax reporting codes by following the instructions in [Set up sales tax reporting codes](../general-ledger/tasks/set-up-sales-tax-reporting-codes.md). The following table provides an example of sales tax reporting codes for Finland.
