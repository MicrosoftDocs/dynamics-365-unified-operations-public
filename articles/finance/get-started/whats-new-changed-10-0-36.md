This article lists features that are new or changed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.36. This version has a build number of 10.0.1695 and is available on the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** July 2023
- **General availability of release (self-update):** September 2023
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** September 2023

## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that made it into the build after this article was initially published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|--------------|---------|------------------|------------|
| Cash and bank management | Enable check number validation | This feature enables the **Allow check number validation** feature in Cash and bank management to validate check numbers when users generate a payment. When the parameter is turned on, the check number is validated to determine whether it exceeds the defined interval from last check number. Users can set up the check number interval. If the check number exceeds the defined interval from the last check number, the user must confirm before they proceed, to avoid manually entering the wrong check number. The feature also validates that there's no character in the check number. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Generate customer and vendor payments from bank statements and reconciliation | This feature enhances the bank statement and reconciliation worksheet. Users can generate and post customer and vendor payment journals directly from selected bank statement lines. The posted customer and vendor payment journals are automatically matched with the original bank statement lines. This feature is a preview feature and is available in sandbox environments in Finance version 10.0.36. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Improved advanced bank reconciliation by enabling group conditions in reconciliation matching rules | In advanced bank reconciliation, grouping conditions are available in the reconciliation matching rules setup, so that bank statement lines can be matched with bank documents in a many-to-many manner. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Automatic importing bank statement from a SharePoint folder | This feature imports bank statement files from a SharePoint folder and lets users set up recurrence rules to periodically import the files. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Bank foreign currency revaluation enhancements | <p>Before this feature, the bank foreign currency revaluation process considered every financial dimension value when the gain or loss was calculated. This feature lets your organization select to use all or none of the financial dimensions when the gain or loss is calculated. In addition, this feature changes the calculation logic. The calculation first calculates the balance of the bank account, with either all financial dimensions or no financial dimensions. It then calculates the unrealized gain or loss per ledger account.</p><p>**Important:** This feature can't be disabled after it's been enabled.</p> | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Accounts payable and accounts receivable foreign currency revaluation performance improvement by splitting into even batches | This feature improves the performance of foreign currency revaluation by splitting large batches into even batches to prevent large batches from a specific vendor or customer. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Use the time zone option on bank statement import page for BAI2 format bank statement id generation | If a bank statement format uses time stamps to generate bank statement IDs, this feature uses the time zone option on the bank statement import page instead of the user option. | Feature management |
| General ledger | Post foreign currency realized gains/losses for ledger settlements | This feature posts foreign currency realized gains and realized losses for ledger settlements when the reporting currency values of the debits and credits differ. This feature also enhances the usability of the ledger settlement process by reducing the effort that's required to mark vouchers. | Feature management |
|General ledger|Financial tags for Sales order documents	|This feature adds Financial tags to the sales order, packing slip and customer invoice documents. |	Feature management|
|Credit and collections|Collections coordinator workspace|This workspace gives the collections coordinator (agent) a new timeline view of invoices, payments, activities and collection letters sent to a customer. A summary of a customer’s payment history, credit and overdue amounts provides more in-depth information helps collections coordinators research customer's history. Contact information directly on the workspace page allows users to start an email with one click or make a phone call to the customer or internal stakeholder on the customer account. |Feature management|
|Credit and collections|Collections coordinator summary|This feature displays an AI-generated summary and an option to create an AI-generated draft email on the collections coordinator workspace. The AI-generated summary includes information about a customer’s payment history, outstanding debt amount and sales. An AI-generated draft email, formatted like a reminder letter, allows the collections coordinator to quickly view and edit an email before sending to customers. |Feature management|
