## Features included in this release

| Global address book | Define a default state/province for each country/region in address setup | You can now define a default state/province for each country/region in the address setup for the global address book. When a default state/province is set, it will be the default value entered in state/province fields when you create a new county or city record for that country/region. For more information, see [Address setup](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/global-address-book-address-setup.md) | Enabled by default |

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements included in this release. Each of these provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they are not listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance). If you want to use or turn off any of these features, you must do that in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Feature area | Feature name in feature management | More information |  
|---|---|---|
| Tax Calculation  |Tax in transfer order   | This feature is enhanced in 10.0.23 to enable printing tax information on transfer order documents. For more information, see [Print tax information on transfer order documents](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174529).   |  
| Tax Calculation   |Tax Calculation Service   |This feature is enhanced in 10.0.23 to support legal entity's primary address in Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. See the section, **Supported countries/regions** in the article, [Tax Calculation overview](../localizations/global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md) for more information.  |  
| Globalization  | (Russia) Run Inventory balance turnover report calculation in batch  | The feature allows you to run the Inventory balance turnover report in batch, to store the result of the calculation, and then view the reports.  |
| Globalization  | (Russia) Post storno financial inventory transactions according to the correction flag in the financial voucher for sales orders  | This feature impacts the credit note corrections functionality for Russia. It enables posting of inventory transactions for sales invoices in accordance with the correction option in the general ledger. When this feature is enabled, there are no more discrepancies between the **Correction** flag on the financial voucher of the inventory transaction and the **Storno** flag on inventory transactions.  | 
| Globalization  | (Czech) Enable manual input sales tax amounts for reversing prepayment sales tax amounts | This feature allows you to manually input sale tax amounts if you need to reverse the prepayment sales tax amount when settling a vendor invoice against a prepayment. When a user marks an invoice and a prepayment for settlement, the system displays the Reverse sales tax amounts for input sales tax amounts for reversing. This is displayed if sales tax rates in prepayment are different from invoice sales tax rates.  | 
| Revenue recognition  | Revenue recognition conversion to feature management from license configuration | Revenue recognition can be turned on and off using Feature management. Users can enable the **Revenue recognition** module in the **Feature management** workspace. In the future, the **Revenue recognition** configuration key will be deprecated. The configuration key will still be available, but because it’s being deprecated, toggling the configuration key won’t have any impact on revenue recognition functionality.   |

### Platform updates for Finance and Operations apps
Dynamics 365 Finance 10.0.23 includes platform updates. To learn more, see [Platform updates for version 10.0.23 of Finance and Operations apps](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/get-started/whats-new-platform-updates-10-0-23.md). 

### Bug fixes 
For information about the bug fixes included in this update, sign in to Lifecycle Services (LCS) and view the [KB article](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Details?bugId=627874). The following issues are fixed in this release.

| Issue| Description |  
|---|---|
| Date filter on Transaction log  | As you use Dynamics 365 Finance, the quantity of data posted within General ledger continues to grow. This growth has an impact on performance when opening the Transaction log. To improve performance when viewing the Transaction log, this change opens the page with a default date filter that shows transactions posted over the last seven days. The default filter can be changed using the filter on the **Date** column.   |  
| Date filter on Transaction log   | Oftentimes you might restart a consolidation process for a date range while the process is still running. This can happen if you believe the process wasn’t started correctly, or that it became stalled after it was started. When the process is restarted, the same date range is entered for the consolidation while the process that had been started with that date range is still running. You might even go to the consolidation transactions and attempt to delete the consolidation results for the same date range while that consolidation process is still running. Issues can arise when multiple processes are run on the same data set at the same time. A change has been added that provides a validation to ensure that a consolidation process, or deletion, can’t be performed for the same date range when another consolidation is already in progress. As part of this change, consolidations must now be done using a batch, rather than in real time. |
