## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements included in this release. Each of these provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they are not listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted). If you want to use any of these features, you must explicitly enable them in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Feature area | Feature name in feature management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts payable  | Process automation - additional support added for modifying query filters   | This feature lets you add tables and filters to process automation queries that are used when you create or edit series or individual occurrences of the process.  |
| Accounts payable   | Block posting and submission of vendor invoices to workflow   | This feature lets you prevent a vendor invoice from being posted or submitted to the workflow process. You can block these processes when a vendor invoice contains a line where the invoice quantity is less than the matched product receipt quantity. Instead, a message will alert the accounts payable clerk to the issue and let them correct it before posting or submitting it to workflow.   |
| Accounts payable   | Enable credit invoicing for vendor invoices   | This feature enables credit invoicing functionality for vendor invoices   |
| Accounts payable and Accounts receivable   | Maturity date validation of posting payment journal with postdated checks to bank account   |  Allow to post payment journals for vendors and customers with postdated checks, when session date is greater or equal to maturity date.  |
| Accounts receivable  | Selection of advance invoices for reversing while posting sales order credit note  | Have a possibility to select advance invoices for reversing while posting sales order credit note. |
| Accounts receivable   | Batch task size number of lines   | Introduces the Account Receivable "Number of document lines in batch task" parameter that adds capability to limit the number of document lines being posted per batch task. The parameter will affect posting of confirmation, picking list, packing slip and invoice.   |
| Cash and bank management  | Turn off set based updates for customer settlement cash discount rate  | <p>This feature causes customer settlement for cash discount dates to be updated individually. Typically, we don't recommend processing cash discount dates individually because the method is significantly slower. However, it might be useful to update cash discount dates individually if you consistently experience deadlock exceptions when updating cash discount dates.</p><p>After turning on this enhancement, go the **Accounts receivable parameters** page and set the **Turn off set based updates for cash discount date** parameter to **Yes** for each company where you've experienced deadlocks. To access the parameter, go to **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Accounts receivable parameters** > **Settlement** > **Options**.</p> |
| Credit and collections   | Collection letter creation performance improvement   | The feature speeds up the process of creating collection letters. This helps in the overall creation process, but the enhanced performance is particularly useful when a smaller number of customers have many transactions.   |
| Finance insights   |  Customer payment predictions  |  This feature uses machine learning to predict when an invoice will be paid. It uses historical invoice, payment, and customer data to create a machine learning model that is used to predict when an invoice will be paid. This feature uses the Power AI service and specific data fields to make predictions. To improve the accuracy of predictions you may choose additional data fields in Power AI that are relevant to your organization when setting up the feature.  |
| Fiscal books  | (Brazil) SPED Reinf updates in events 5011 and 2055   | This fix enables the updates introduced in EFD-Reinf Developer Guidance Manual of version 1.5.01 published in April 2021. The main changes are related to service name and parameters of inquiring events 5011 and 2055.   |
| Fiscal books  | (Brazil) NFC-e synchronous processing   | This feature enables NFC-e synchronous processing on retail POS terminals and in Commerce headquarters.   |
| Fixed assets   | Lock asset book in depreciation journal   | This feature lets you prevent posting depreciation to an asset book that's been selected on another unposted journal. The feature is turned on from the Fixed asset parameters.   |
| General ledger | Performance enhancement for large consolidations   | We've added a performance improvement to the consolidation in General ledger to allow each batch to run more efficiently. The enhancement works by processing the General ledger data in parallel and an extension point has been added if you need to customize it.   |
| General ledger   | Generate trial balance with pending type transactions   | This feature lets you select specific pending type transactions to include on the Trial balance detail report.   |
| General ledger   |  <p>General ledger year-end enhancements  | The setup of the year-end closing templates will be moved to a new setup page. The existing year-end close page will change, similar to the general ledger foreign currency revaluation, where a list displays each time the year end close is run or reversed. An accounting manager can initiate the year end close from the new page.</p><p>If the accounting manager wants to reverse the year-end close, they can select the most recent fiscal year for the appropriate legal entity and choose the Reverse year-end close button. The reversal will delete the accounting entries for the previous year-end close, and will not rerun the year-end close automatically.</p><p>You can rerun the year-end close, by restarting the process for the fiscal year and legal entity. The process will continue to use the General ledger parameter setting to determine whether the year-end close rerun will account for only the new or changed transactions, or completely reverse the previous close, rerunning the process for all transactions.</p> |
| Tax   | (India) Enable to include tax collection at source (TCS) in the total invoice value of an invoice    | If this feature is enabled, the user will be able to include TCS (Tax collection at source) tax amount in the total invoice value of the sales and purchase invoice.   |

## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in 10.0.21. Most features that have been turned on atomically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory.  This is to ensure that customers are using current functionality, so that as enhancements are added they can build on the current functionality. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they are determined to be essential.

> Advanced ledger settlement was introduced as a new feature before Feature management was widely available. This feature was turned on and off using a General ledger parameter. The Advanced ledger settlement feature has been evaluated and is now turned on by default; it can’t be turned off. The parameter that turned it on and off was removed, so all customers should be using advanced ledger settlement functionality moving forward. New enhancements for Ledger settlement are in progress, and are dependent on the Advanced ledger settlement feature being turned on.

### Additional information for Tax features

| Feature name in feature management | More information |

| (India) Enable withholding setup for currency validation to prevent the withholding payment from failing due to currency variations | This feature ensures that the currency is set up for withholding tax codes and the withholding tax authority in the accounting currency.

The credit or debit note can be issued by using the general journal, a free text invoice, or an export sales order. A separate number sequence for exporting a credit or debit note must be set up on the **GST Reference number Sequence Group** page. The shipping bill number and date can be recorded in the credit or debit note for reference. |
