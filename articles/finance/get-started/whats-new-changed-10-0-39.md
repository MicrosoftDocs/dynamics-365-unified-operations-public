| Accounts payable | New vendor invoice center | This feature introduces a new workspace that replaces the current **Vendor invoice automation** workspace. The new workspace provides an intuitive view of the invoices in the different stages of vendor invoice processing. Detailed drill-down lists and Copilot integration for exception handling will be introduced in upcoming releases. | Default off |
| Accounts payable (Invoice capture) | Document type settings for transferred invoice document from Invoice capture | This feature lets customers decide which document type to apply to documents that are transferred from Invoice capture. The document type can be set across legal entities. | |
| Accounts payable (Invoice capture) | Support the transfer of default financial dimensions on the header of cost invoice | This feature copies the default financial dimensions (Business unit, Cost center, and Department) that are transferred from Invoice capture and appear on the header of cost invoices. This feature streamlines the invoice process and redirects the invoices to the correct person for approval. No additional extension in Dynamics 365 Finance is required. | |
| Accounts payable | Adding purchase order's requester and orderer as the invoice approver | In typical purchase order invoice processing, if there's a discrepancy between the invoice and postings, the purchase order requester or the orderer must be added to approve the invoice after the purchase order is corrected in the workflow. This feature provides an additional type of participant in vendor invoice workflow: **Vendor invoice PO approver**. It also add two participants: **Purchase order - requester** and **Purchase order - orderer**. | Default off |
| Cash and bank management | Modern bank reconciliation | This feature improves the usability and performance of advanced bank reconciliation. It also provides feature enhancements. Several new capabilities are available on the bank reconciliation worksheet, including the capability to clear reversal company transactions, generate vouchers, generate payment journals, and settle open customer invoices. Bank reconciliation matching rules are enhanced to automatically run these capabilities through user-defined criteria. This feature is a preview feature and is available in sandbox environments in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.39. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Petty cash | Petty cash is now a global feature for all countries/regions in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.39.

| Cash and bank management | Customer and vendor netting | This feature enables netting capability between open customer balances and open vendor balances. Customer and vendor payment journals are no longer created to settle open vendor and customer transactions. Instead, netting journals are created. This feature is a preview feature and is available in production environments in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.39. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Automatic clear bridged transactions through advanced bank reconciliation | This feature automatically clears bridged payment transactions through bank reconciliation.

This feature is a preview feature and is available in production environments in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.39. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Exchange rate type enhancement for accounts payable and accounts receivable foreign currency revaluation | This feature provides additional exchange rate type options for accounts payable and accounts receivable foreign currency revaluation.

| Tax | Universal tax rate API | The connection to an external tax solution provider helps simplify and reduce the effort of maintaining the tax rates and tax applicability rules for Tax calculation. This benefit is especially critical when you implement Tax calculation for countries/regions where a significant number of tax jurisdictions must be covered. The Universal Tax Rate API is a set of standard application programming interfaces that Microsoft has defined in Tax calculation, based on the taxable document data model. It's an extended feature of Tax calculation that enables external tax services to be connected under the same framework. | Feature management |
| System administration | Archive with Dataverse long term retention | This feature lets you archive data for select high volume areas of the product. The data archive is performed by a micro-service and a connection to Dataverse. You must first install the service from the Power platform admin center (PPAC). | Feature management |


## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2024wave1/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature area | Feature name | More information |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Cash and bank management | Customer and vendor netting | Automatic netting is available. Users can configure netting rules, run batch jobs, or run process automation to automatically net open balances under the selected netting agreements and additional criteria. |
| Cash and bank management | Customer and vendor netting | Two data entities, Netting agreement and Netting agreement pair, are available to import netting agreements. |
| Cash and bank management | Customer and vendor netting | Conditional tax is supported in customer and vendor netting. |
| Cash and bank management | Payment reversals | Check reversal isn't allowed if the original check is marked as cleared. |
| Cash and bank management | Bank statements | The performance of BAI2 format bank statement import is improved. |
| Cash and bank management | Bank reconciliation | Financial tags are supported in advanced bank reconciliation. |
| Credit and collections | Credit and collections workspace (preview) | A new **Collections coordinator** overview page has been added to the workspace. This new page is enabled by the same feature in Feature management. The new overview page shows activities that are assigned to the collections agent (coordinator). It includes separate lists for the customers that have the highest balance and the aging balance report that has the oldest balances. Select the customer name in any list to go to the existing **Collections coordinator** workspace detail page, which has an updated layout. |
|Credit and collections |  Collections process automation  |  **Track step in collections process automation** is a new option in the **Setup collection process automation parameters** page. Set this parameter to **Yes** to track the last step completed in the collections process automation details. This ensures that every invoice goes through all process automation steps and send all collection letters in the sequence, regardless of when the invoice starts the process. For example, if a customer has disputed an invoice and then it's resolved at a later date, the collections process automation will start at the first step and send the first collection letter. For more information, see [Collections process automation](../accounts-receivable/collections-process-automate.md). 


| Tax | Prepayment handling | Tax calculation supports the **Prepayment handling** page when the journal business process is enabled on the **Tax calculation parameters** page. |
