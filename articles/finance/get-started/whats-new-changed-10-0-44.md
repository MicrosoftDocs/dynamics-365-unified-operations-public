## Features included in this release

This section contains a table that lists the features that are included in this release when available. We might update this article to include features that were added to the build after this article was originally published.

| Module or feature area | Feature name | More information | Enabled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fixed assets | Post the inventory close adjustment to the fixed assets subledger after purchase order invoice adjustment | This feature automatically adjusts fixed assets acquired via inventory items. When you adjust a purchase order invoice, the inventory closing recalculation posts the corresponding entries to the fixed assets subledger. Likewise, if an inventory to fixed assets journal records a different item cost to acquire a fixed asset, the adjustment is posted automatically to the fixed assets subledger through inventory closing recalculation adjustment. This ensures consistent data, less manual work, and accurate financial records.| Feature management |
| Fixed assets | Budget depreciation proposal running in the background across multiple legal entities | This feature introduces a new menu item, **Create budget depreciation proposal**, that uses background batch job processing to run depreciation budgets across multiple legal entities. Users no longer have to manually run the budget for each company. Therefore, this feature helps save time, reduce manual effort, and enhance consistency throughout the organization. | Default  |
| Fixed assets | Add financial tags on inventory to fixed asset journal | This feature adds financial tags to the line details in the inventory to fixed asset journal, so that users can assign financial tags before posting. This feature helps improve asset categorization and traceability, and therefore leads to more accurate financial management and streamlined reporting. | Default |
| Fixed assets |Enable scheduled start date/time on recurrence of proposals| The **Scheduled start date/time and time zone** fields are added to the **Define recurrence batch** when enabled. The system automatically schedules the batch via scheduler logic, logs the event in batch history, shows a confirmation, and lets users modify or clear the schedule up to five minutes before execution (reverting to manual start if cleared).| |
| Fixed assets |Multi-Company purpose |This feature introduces a new **Multi-company processes** Organization hierarchy purpose and replaces the existing legal entity multi. Any hierarchy assigned the **Multi-company processes** purpose appears in a new control with a hierarchical parent-child selector, where you can search, sort, and select multiple legal entities for fixed asset depreciation and asset leasing batch journal creation.|Feature management |
|Fixed assets |Preview) Fixed assets proposals batch enhancements |This feature enhances the efficiency of creating depreciation proposal batch jobs/tasks. It incorporates fixed assets with various ID formats in the depreciation proposal, prevents the creation of blank journals for depreciation proposals, and avoids journal duplication in case of temporary errors. Additionally, it boosts the asset transactions cache for depreciation proposals, resulting in enhanced processing speed for depreciation proposals.|Feature management |
| Fixed assets |(Preview) Fixed assets light cache |All transaction history calls (depreciation runs, posting jobs, reports, etc.) reference the Light cache layer first, while preserving legacy cache and direct-read fallbacks. |Feature management |
| Fixed assets |  (Preview) Disable Fixed assets transactions cache |This feature forces all transaction history calls depreciation and postings to bypass both Light and legacy caches and affect the database directly. This is ideal as a temporary troubleshooting fallback that can be disabled to instantly restore high-performance caching.| Feature management |
| Asset leasing | Ability to assign sales tax group and item tax group on the asset lease | This feature introduces **Sales tax group** and **Item sales tax group** fields in the lease/lease book. When a lease book is marked as **Pay to vendor**, these defined values are automatically copied to the vendor invoice journal that is created from the payment schedule. If a vendor or main account already specifies a sales tax group or item sales tax group, the system uses those values by default. Otherwise, it applies the default values that are defined on the lease.| Feature management |
| Asset leasing | Add cancel option to the lease termination | The **Lease termination proposal cancellation** feature adds a **Cancel** option, so that users can revoke termination proposals. When this option is selected, the **Proposal status** value is updated to **Canceled**, and the lease book is reset. Therefore, this feature helps enhance flexibility and ensure accurate, controlled lease management. | Feature management |
| General ledger | Year-end close job status verification | To ensure that a year-end close job is really running and isn't stuck in an error state from a batch crash or restart, a batch job is added to the Ledger fiscal close service history table. Therefore, you can confirm whether the batch job is active and safely reset its status as required. | Feature management |
| General ledger | Review missing settlement accounts | The **Review missing settlement accounts** page shows any ledger accounts that have ledger settlements but that are missing from the **Ledger settlement** tab in General ledger parameters. Learn more in [Ledger settlements](../general-ledger/ledger-settlements.md). | Default |
| Cash and bank management | Bank transactions page performance improvement | This feature introduces performance enhancements on the **Bank transactions** page. Users can now optionally set default filters, so that the page shows only transactions that meet defined criteria. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Enable process automation for bank foreign currency revaluation | When this feature is enabled, users can use process automation to run bank foreign currency revaluation. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Accounts payable enable settle with priority | This feature enhances the **Accounts payable** module by introducing settlement priority. Users can assign a predetermined order to transactions. That order can then be applied during both manual settlement and automatic settlement. | Feature management |
| Credit and collections | Collection process automation to include project invoices and general journals | Collection process automation previously didn't include project invoices and general journals. When this feature is enabled, users can include those documents. | Feature management |
| Credit and collections | Include general journals in the interest calculation process | When users create interest notes, they can include general journals, so that interest is calculated on them. | Feature Management |
| Accounts receivable | Prepayment customer invoice feature | When this feature is enabled, users can create and manage invoices for customer prepayments. This feature streamlines the invoicing process and helps enhance customer relationships by offering flexible payment options. | Feature management |
| Subscription billing | Performance issue creating billing detail lines for daily usage billing schedule line | This feature helps improve performance by replacing the line-based logic with set-based processing for Subscription billing consumption entry. In addition, this feature updates pricing control logic to help ensure consistency and prevent pricing discrepancies. | Feature management |
| Subscription billing | Performance improvement for consumption quantity update | Termination adjustments are now calculated by using the exchange rate on the termination date. In addition, currency fluctuation differences are posted to the Profit and loss account, and a clear audit trail is maintained in the deferral schedule. | Feature management |
| Accounts receivable | Clean up Free text invoice temp tables used in Free text invoice report. | Data update automatically schedules maintenance jobs to clean up temporary data for free text and sales invoice reports. Therefore, users don't have to manually schedule those jobs. | Default |
| General ledger | (Production ready preview) Account Reconciliation Agent | This feature enables the Account Reconciliation Agent for exceptions that are shown in the **Account reconciliation** workspace and provides recommended actions for exceptions. | Feature management |

## Feature enhancements included in this release

Therefore, the feature ensures that each bank statement file is unique and helps prevent redundancy. | Default |
