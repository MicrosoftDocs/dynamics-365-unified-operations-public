## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that made it into the build after this article was initially published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|--------------|---------|------------------|------------|
| Cash and bank management | Net customer and vendor balance | This feature enables the netting capability between open customer balances and open vendor balances. Customer and vendor payment journals are no longer created to settle open vendor and customer transactions. Instead, netting journals are created. This feature is a preview feature and is available in sandbox environments in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.38. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Settle bank statement with open customer invoices | This feature enhances the bank statement and reconciliation worksheet. Users can settle open customer invoices directly from selected bank statement lines. Users can turn on the **Generate customer and vendor payments from bank statements and reconciliation** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. This feature is a preview feature and is available in sandbox environments in Finance version 10.0.38. | Feature management |
| Cash and bank management | Generate NACHA payment file by Electronic reporting | This feature enables the generation of Electronic reporting (ER) for National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) payment files. To use this feature, users can import ER configurations under **Standard NACHA (US) - customers** and **Standard NACHA (US) - vendors**. | |
| General ledger | Post foreign currency realized gains/losses for ledger settlements | <p>In Finance version 10.0.36, this feature posted foreign currency realized gains and realized losses for ledger settlements when the *reporting currency* values of the debits and credits differ. In Finance version 10.0.38, new capabilities are added that post foreign currency realized gains and realized losses for ledger settlements when the *accounting currency* values of the debits and credits differ.</p><p>This feature also changes the determination of whether a ledger settlement is fully settled. The feature now makes this determination based on the *transaction currency*, unless the ledger settlement and the transaction currencies differ for the marked transactions. In that case, the *accounting currency* values are used to determine whether the marked transactions are balanced. This feature doesn't support partial settlement. | Feature management |
| Tax calculation | [Integration with project transactions](/dynamics365/release-plan/2023wave2/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-finance/tax-calculation-service-integration-project-operations) | Tax calculation integration is now extended with the following Project management and accounting transactions in finance and operations apps: Project invoice proposal, Journals (Hour/Expense/Item/Fee), Project quotations, and Project Operations integration journal. | Parameter |
| General Ledger | Performance enhancement for general ledger dimension set balance calculation | This feature enables your trial balance inquiry page and reports that use financial dimension sets to run more efficiently. The financial dimension sets store data more efficiently, in less space, and enable the trial balance to show the current balance data more quickly. This feature uses process automation to keep the balance amounts up to date. | Feature management |
