This article lists features that are new or changed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.28. This version has a build number of 10.0.1264 and is available on the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** May 2022
- **General availability of release (self-update):** July 2022
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** July 2022

## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that made it into the build after this article was initially published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|----|----|----|----|
| Accounts payable | Enabling purchase order prepayment functionality | Prepayment invoice functionality can be used, regardless of whether you're using the **Journalizing customer\vendor settlement transactions** functionality. To use prepayment invoice functionality, go to **Accounts payable parameters** \> **Ledger and sales tax**, and then, on the **Prepayment invoice** FastTab, set the **Use prepayment invoice** option to **Yes**. | Parameter |
| Budget control | Budget control document filtering enhancement | This feature provides a query-based filter option for each document that is included in budget control, so that you can specify which budget control documents are budget checked. Therefore, you can specify that only a subset of a document type should be checked (for example, only purchase orders where the **Pool** field is set to **01**). | Feature management |
| Fixed assets (Russia) | Start and finish date of depreciation | In the **Depreciation start date** field, you can select **From date when put into operation**. The system then starts to calculate the depreciation from the date when the asset is put into operation and completes the depreciation on the date of disposal. | Parameter |
| General ledger | Unmark all ledger transactions within ledger settlement | Sometimes, ledger transactions that can't be settled are marked for ledger settlement, because the system determines that the transactions have been settled. To work around this issue, you can unmark all the ledger transactions for all users and legal entities in the system. When this feature is enabled, a new button that is named **Unmark all transactions** is added to the **Ledger settlement** page. Select this button to unmark all ledger settled transactions for all users and legal entities in the system. This button is available only to administrators. | Default |
| General ledger | Option to display main account category on trial balance | This feature lets you add the main account category as a column on the **Trial balance** list page. A **Display main account category** option has been added to the menu under the **Columns to display** button on the trial balance. | Default |
| Tax calculation | Integration with general journal | [Tax Calculation integration with finance and operations apps](../localizations/global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md) | Parameter |
| Tax calculation | Integration with vendor invoice journal | [Tax Calculation integration with finance and operations apps](../localizations/global-tax-calcuation-service-overview.md) | Parameter |
| Globalization | (ER) Use labels of the parent data model in the derived format | You can use labels of the parent [Electronic reporting (ER)](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md) data model in the format that you derived from this model. When you enable the **Enhanced access to labels of the ascendent ER data model** feature, you can also access labels of the ascendent ER data model when you derive your format from another format and select the alternative data model during this process. For more information, see [Lifecycle](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-design-multilingual-reports.md#lifecycle). | Feature management |
| Globalization | (ER) Specify a language for a generated ER document | You can specify the preferred language for a generated document that is received as a file. By default, this language is ignored in the formula that is designed to generate the name of a generated file. When you enable the **Apply the 'Language preference' parameter to the 'File name' expression** feature, you can make this formula dependent on the preferred language that you specify for a generated document. For more information, see [Format](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-design-multilingual-reports.md#format). | Feature management |

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature area | Feature name | More information |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Credit and collections | Update collection status when payment is manually settled | This enhancement updates the collection status when a payment is manually settled outside the payment journal. Previously, the collection status was updated only if the invoice was settled in the customer payment journal. Now, the collection status will be updated to the appropriate status when a payment is manually settled. |
| Globalization | (ER) Modify ER formats by reapplying Excel templates | ER lets you [reapply](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/modify-electronic-reporting-format-reapply-excel-template.md) the updated Excel template to the ER format. The ER format is then updated so that it adheres to the updated template. Initially, the ER format isn't updated even if you reapply the template with the updated headers and footers. The released feature improvement lets you update the ER format when you reapply to it the template that contains the updated headers and footers. For more information, see [Update a template](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-fillable-excel.md#update-a-template). |
| Globalization | (ER) Notify user at design time whether the configured ER destination is applicable at runtime | You can configure [ER destinations](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-destinations.md) for the selected ER format. The applicability of the configured ER destinations [depends](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-destinations.md#applicability) on format versioning and ER user parameters. Therefore, you can't predict at design time whether the configured ER destinations will be used at runtime. The released feature improvement analyzes ER user parameters and the versioning of the selected format, and it warns you if the configured ER destinations aren't applicable at runtime. This improvement also provides two options for fixing the issue to make the configured ER destinations applicable at runtime. |
| Globalization | (ER) Fetch records of application tables | You can use ER data sources of the *Table records* type to fetch records from application tables, entities, views, and so on. By default, all fields of a specified table are fetched at runtime. To improve execution performance and optimize memory consumption, you can change the data source settings to reduce the number of fetched fields. For more, see [Improve performance of ER solutions by reducing the number of table fields that are fetched at runtime](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-reduce-fetched-fields-number.md). |
