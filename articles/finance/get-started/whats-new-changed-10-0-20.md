## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements included in this release. Each of these provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they are not listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted). If you want to use any of these features, you must explicitly enable them in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Feature area | Feature&nbsp;name&nbsp;in feature&nbsp;management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Cost management | Enable user-defined batch number setup for inventory closing reverse|Inventory closing reverse creates batch jobs for each impacted item, which might throttle the batch server if there are too many items. This feature enables the process to use the 'Extra batch helpers', which is currently used by the inventory closing process. You can adjust the setting to optimize the performance considering your environment. |
| General ledger | Enhanced filtering on the cash position inquiry | This feature enhances financial dimension filtering on the cash position inquiry. When enabled, only records that match all entered segment criteria will be returned on the inquiry. Otherwise records that match any entered segment criteria will be returned.  |
