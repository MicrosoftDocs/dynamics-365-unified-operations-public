|---|---|---|---|
| Accounts receivable | Prevent duplicate invoices for free text invoices | In Finance version 10.0.42, the **Check the invoice number used** parameter is added to the **Updates** tab of the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.

In Feature management, enable **(Preview) Archive Customer invoice with long term retention** to see this on the workspace.
