This article lists features that are new or changed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.32. This version has a build number of 10.0.1515 and is available on
the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** January 2023
- **General availability of release (self-update):** March 2023
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** April 2023

## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that made it into the build after this article was initially published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|--------------|---------|------------------|------------|
| Global address book | Advanced address maintenance | This feature lets users delete historical and inactive addresses. | Feature management |
| Globalization | ([ER](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md)) Run the Document routing agent as a service | The Document routing agent (DRA) lets you select the mode of execution. The process can run as either a desktop application or a Windows service. Before version 10.0.32, Electronic reporting (ER) supported the DRA only when it ran as a desktop application. As of version 10.0.32, it also supports the DRA when it runs as a Windows service. For more information, see [Run the Document routing agent as a service](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-destination-type-print.md#run-the-document-routing-agent-as-a-service). | Feature management |
| Subscription billing | Project integration with Recurring contract billing | This feature links billing schedules and projects for invoicing scenarios. | Feature management |
| Credit and collections | Use percentage in parameters to calculate batch tasks for the customer aging snapshot | This feature specifies the percentage of customers per batch task when the aging snapshot is run. The percentage is specified under **Collections defaults** on the **Credit and collections parameters** page. | Feature management |

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature area | Feature name | More information |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Cash and bank management | Ability to post detailed vendor and customer payments, but summarize amounts to bank account | When this feature is enabled, an organization can post vendor and customer payments in separate vouchers, but update the bank account in summary. New options that are added to the journal name setup provide the flexibility to post payments to the bank account in detail for some journals but in summary for others. Payments that are included in the summarized amount that's posted to the bank account must exist in the same journal, and they must have the same bank account, currency, and transaction date. The introduction of this feature eliminates the need to use the "One voucher" functionality to post vendor or customer payments to the bank subledger in summary. |
| Fixed assets | Post disposal transactions in detail | This feature lets you specify the level of detail to use for the accounting entries that are generated when a fixed asset disposal sale/scrap transaction is posted. To post in detail, you must define the posting types (acquisition this year, acquisition prior year, depreciation this year, and depreciation prior year) on the **Fixed asset profile parameter** page. The posting process will fail if these posting types aren't defined. If you don't post in detail, only the **Disposal sale/scrap** account that the **Net book value** posting type is specified for on the **Fixed asset posting profile** page will be validated when a disposal sale/scrap transaction is posted. |
| General ledger | Currency revaluation posting profile | The currency revaluation posting profile helps define currency revaluation adjustment accounts at a granular level per currency and per module (**General ledger**, **Accounts payable**, **Accounts receivable**, and **Bank**). You can identify either the currency or the account as the lowest level of defaulting if overlapping accounts are defined at the account or currency level. If no accounts are defined in the currency revaluation posting profile, the currency revaluation adjustment will be posted to the accounts that are defined in the currency revaluation accounts. If these accounts aren't defined, the currency revaluation adjustment will be posted to the accounts that are defined on the **Ledger** page. |
| General ledger | Accounting source explorer advanced filtering | The new **Accounting source explorer advanced filtering** feature is available in Feature management. This feature replaces the **Update** button and provides a more robust advanced query experience that resembles what's available on the **Voucher transactions** page. The advanced filter will let you filter on fields that are similar to what you find on the **Voucher transactions query** page, such as **Ledger account**, **Business unit**, **Cost center**, and **Department**. |
| General ledger | Ability to automatically settle ledger accounts based on date tolerance criteria | The **Automate ledger settlements** feature has been enhanced to let you define date tolerance matching criteria. The date criteria are used if the dates of the ledger settlement debit and credit transactions should be considered during the automatic ledger settlements process. You can choose to enter the number of days of variance for the debit and credit transactions dates. The variance is calculated as the number of days between the debit and credit transaction dates, searching before and after the selected transaction date. These additional criteria can help improve the success rate of the automated settlement matching. |
| General ledger | Ability to view the Payment reference information for Ledger settlement accounts | Payment reference information can now be viewed on the **Ledger settlements** page. This information can help accounting staff find matching debits and credits. |
| General ledger | Review cross-year settlements | A new inquiry lets you identify, unsettle, and resettle ledger transactions that are settled across fiscal years. To view the information, open the **Ledger settlements** page (**General ledger \> Periodic tasks \> Ledger settlements \> Review cross-year settlements**). This feature has been backported to version 10.0.29 and is available in the 10.0.29 release or later of Dynamics 365 Finance. |
| Subscription billing | Renew automatically for revenue split billing schedule lines | Billing schedules where lines are marked for revenue split can now be marked for automatic renewal. |
| Subscription billing | OData entity for termination of billing schedule | An Open Data Protocol (OData) entity has been added to enable the termination of billing schedules. |
| Subscription billing | Mass termination removal | This feature lets users remove terminations by using the Mass termination process. |
| Globalization | Global withholding tax | **Withholding tax group** and **Item withholding tax group** fields are integrated into the lines on the free text invoice. Withholding tax will be calculated and posted when free text invoices are settled. |
| Tax calculation | Tax calculation service | The **Sales tax on sales tax** field is enabled in the tax codes setup in the tax calculation service. The user can use this field to specify the base tax code for the **Tax on Tax** tax codes. |
| Tax calculation | Tax calculation data model | <p>The following fields are extended for the latest tax calculation data model:</p><ul><li>Is Prepayment Journal Voucher</li><li>Direct Delivery</li><li>Intercompany Direct Delivery</li></ul><p>These header fields are enabled in the List code applicability table.</p> |

## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.32. Most features that have been turned on atomically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory. This change ensures that customers are using current functionality, so that as enhancements are added, they can build on the current functionality. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they are determined to be essential.
