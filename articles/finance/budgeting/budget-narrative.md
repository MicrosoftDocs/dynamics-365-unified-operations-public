# Budget plan narrative

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you're planning to publish budget books or documents, it's sometimes necessary to include a description and/or a revenue summary in a budget plan. This information can include a description of the budget plan, or a list of assumptions, performance measures, revenue information, or proposed changes to services that led to the amounts on specific budget lines. This feature will enable you to use an HTML editor to control budget planners to document the considerations that went into creating the plan.

You can use the control to write new content or you can paste content that is written and formatted in another text editor, such as Microsoft Word. The narrative area also lets you changes fonts and text formatting. Additional features, including a spell checker, can be turned on.
 
The content that's added to these two sections can be printed separately in a budget plan narrative report.
 
## Setting up the budget plan narrative
Complete the following steps to turn on the budget plan narrative area and use the most current HTML editor that's available in the product.
1.	Enable the **Budget plan narrative** under feature management. You can also enable the **New HTML editor control** in the **Feature management** workspace to use a more current editor.
2.	In the **Budget planning module**, select a budget plan and enter the necessary information for the budget plan header.
3.	Expand the **Budget plan narrative** section and add descriptions or revenue information that should be included in the budget plan.
 
The permission for modifying the budget plan narrative is the same as that for modifying budget lines. This permission is set using the **Budget plan process** page (**Budget > Setup > Budget Planning > Budget plan process**).
