[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the **Budget control account detail history** report. This report lets users view budget account entries for the selected financial dimension and legal entity.

To generate the report, users select a financial dimension, a budget model, and a budget cycle time span that the organization uses. Selected dates should match the selected budget cycle. Alternatively, users can define a range of dates in the fiscal calendar that is associated with the budget cycle. Users can also select a range of specific accounts or all accounts.

## Filter the report 

When users generate the report, the following parameters are available.

| Field | Description |

| **Dimension criteria** | Select a financial dimension set for the report. A financial dimension set is a named group of accounts or dimensions. It contains either account values for the account or dimension values for a single dimension.

Financial dimension sets are defined on the **Financial dimension sets** page. |

| **Dates to include** | Select either the **Budget cycle** option or the **Date range** option. |
| **Budget cycle** | If you selected the **Budget cycle** option, select the name of a budget cycle. In this case, the report includes the dates that are set up for the selected budget cycle on the **Budget cycle time spans** page. |
| **From date** | If you selected the **Date range** option, select the start date for the budget account entries to include on the report. The date must be in one of the fiscal years that are included in the fiscal calendar that was selected when the budget cycle time span was set up. For example, a fiscal calendar for a budget cycle includes fiscal years that have dates from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2024. In this case, the **From date** value can't be before January 1, 2020.|
| **To date** | If you selected the **Date range** option, select the end date for the budget account entries to include on the report. The date must be in one of the fiscal years that are included in the fiscal calendar that was selected when the budget cycle time span was set up.

In this case, the **To date** value can't be after December 31, 2024.|
