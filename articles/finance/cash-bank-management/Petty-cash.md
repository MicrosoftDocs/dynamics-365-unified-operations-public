# Petty cash 

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the petty cash functionality that extends existing localization features as a global feature for all countries and regions. For more information, see [Petty cash for Eastern Europe and Russia](/localizations/europe/emea-petty-cash.md). 

You can use the petty cash functionality to automate the receipt and expenditure of cash, the creation of primary documents, and the printing of related reports. 

Petty cash performs the following actions:

- Account the receipt and expenditure of available cash assets.
- Generate typical cash forms. Examples include cash reimbursement slips, cash disbursement slips, and the journal of registration for cash slips.
- Control the maximum cash amount that's allowed for customers or vendors.
- Reflect cash operations in various currencies.
- Convert the amounts of cash operations in foreign currency to the default currency to provide accounting reporting.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the petty cash functionality, the following prerequisites must be in place:

- Enable petty cash.
- Set up the following items:

    - Cash accounts
    - Cash posting profiles
    - Number sequences for cash document numbering
    - Default values for Cash and bank management parameters
    - Cash journal names in General ledger

## Daily cash operations via a General journal

To create a cash transaction via a General journal, follow these steps.

2. On the Action Pane, select **Lines**.
3. Add a line, and enter the following information.

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Field</th>

    <td>Debit, Credit</td>
    <td><p>Enter the cash document amount in one of these fields:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Debit</strong> – Use this field to register cash receipts and a Cash reimbursement slip.</li>

    </table>

If the registered transaction is a prepayment, on the **Payment** tab, select the **Prepayment** checkbox. In the **Representative** section, set the fields to print on the **Cash** report. To review journal entries, on the Action Pane, select **Validate**.

## Cash transaction approval and posting

For cash transactions, the following statuses can be applied: 

- None
- Confirmed
- Approved
- Rejected

A **Use confirm status** parameter is available on the **Approval** FastTab of the **Cash** tab. Go to **Cash and bank management** \> **Setup** \> **Cash and bank management parameters** to activate two additional statuses: **Confirmed** and **Rejected**. 

Confirmation is appropriate when cash documents are issued, and cash receipts or expenditures are shared between two employees: an accountant and a cashier. The **Reset status** function changes the current transaction status. **Approved** becomes **Confirmed**, and **Confirmed** becomes **None**. Cash journal entries can be edited only when the status is **None**. Cash transactions can be rejected only when the transaction status is **Confirmed**. 

- To confirm a transaction, select the corresponding Slip journal line, and then select **Documents approval** \> **Confirm**. An order number is generated based on the specified number sequence. The transaction status is changed to **Confirmed**, and you can no longer edit the journal line. The cash account balance remains unchanged.
- To reject a cash document, select **Documents approval** \> **Reject**. This option is available only for documents that have **Confirmed** status.
- To approve a transaction, select the corresponding Slip journal line, and then select **Documents approval** \> **Approve**. The **Approved** status indicates that cash funds are received or expended. The cash balance is changed. The cash transaction can be posted.
- To cancel an **Approved** status and reset the status to **None**, select **Documents approval** \> **Reset status**. Only approved cash transactions can be posted. To post a journal, select **Post** \> **Post**.

## Periodic tasks

To complete the following tasks, go to **Cash and bank management** \> **Periodic tasks**.

| Periodic task                       | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Check balance limit                 | Check the balance for the selected cash account on the specified date, and show the result in an information message. Only approved transactions can be counted in the balance calculation. |
| Cash balance recalculation          | Use this task to confirm that the ledger balances for cash accounts fit the cash balance. |
| Foreign currency revaluation - Cash | Use this task to ensure that you have an adequate balance in the default currency on the reporting date when the operations are entered in foreign currencies. Use the **Filter** function on the **Records to include** tab to specify the cash account to run the task for. In the dialog box for the task, use the **From currency** and **To Currency** fields to specify transaction currencies. The system compares the amount in the currency that was converted by using the exchange rate on the selected date with the amount in the default currency. The difference between the two amounts (excluding the previous exchange adjustment) is the calculated exchange adjustment. This task creates an approved cash transaction of the **Exchange adjustment** type. The ledger transaction is created by using the ledger account for cash that's specified in the **Unrealized profit** or **Unrealized loss** field in the **Currency** table. |

## Inquiries and reports

| Inquiry or report            | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| Cash transactions            | Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Cash transactions** to view cash transactions. Use the **Filter** function to specify additional criteria to limit the selection of cash transactions. |
| Cash balance                 | Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Cash balance** to view the cash balance. |
| Cash - Ledger reconciliation | Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Cash reports** \> **Cash - Ledger reconciliation** to run this report. |
| Cash statement report        | Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Cash reports** \> **Cash statement report** to run this report. |
| Cash transaction report      | Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Cash reports** \> **Cash transactions report** to run this report. |
