This article explains how to post vouchers to the general ledger in advanced bank reconciliation. As of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.39, the **Modern bank reconciliation** feature provides this functionality. 

There might be bank statement transactions that aren't related to specific customer or vendor payments. Examples include bank interest income and bank fees. This feature lets users post bank statement transactions of this type directly to the general ledger.

## Prerequisites

- Turn on the **Modern bank reconciliation** feature in the **Feature management** workspace.
- Set up bank transaction types.
- Set up number sequences for the **Bank statement reversal** reference in Cash and bank management parameters.
- Import a bank statement.

    - **Item sales tax group** (if applicable)

1. Go to **Cash and bank management** \> **Bank statement reconciliation** \> **Bank reconciliation**.
1. Open or create a bank reconciliation worksheet.
1. Select **Run matching rules**.
1. Select either the matching rule that you defined or a matching rule set that contains that matching rule.
