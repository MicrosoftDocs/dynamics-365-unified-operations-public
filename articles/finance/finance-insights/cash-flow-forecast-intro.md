[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Cash flow is critical to any business. Even profitable companies can face insolvency if they don't maintain the cash flow to meet immediate needs. The cash flow forecasting capability in Finance insights can help companies monitor and manage their cash balances effectively. This feature uses machine learning to help businesses forecast cash flows more accurately than they have previously. It can also help managers make decisions that optimize opportunities in the context of their current cash position. 

For most companies, managing cash flow and running cash flow forecasting is a tedious, repetitive, and manual process. Most companies rely on Microsoft Excel solutions that have varying degrees of complexity. The challenges of accurately forecasting cash flow include the following points:

- Data isn't available to decision makers because it's scattered in multiple places, including: 
  - The accounting or enterprise resource planning system
  - Financial planning software
  - Excel
  - Additional software applications 
- Forecasting is based on internal knowledge that resides in "silos" within each domain or department.
- Measuring the accuracy of cash flow forecasting after the financials have been realized is uncertain and difficult.
