This article explains how to turn on the Budget proposal feature in Finance Insights.

1. Open the **Feature management** workspace, and follow these steps:

    1. Select **Check for updates**.
    2. On the **All** tab, search for **Budget proposal**. If you don't find that feature, search for **(Preview) Budget proposal**. 
    3. Turn on the feature.

2. Go to **Budgeting \> Setup \> Basic Budgeting \> Budget proposal**, and select **Enable feature**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Budget proposal** feature requires a minimum of three years of budget or actual data. This feature uses three to ten years of data in the projections. More than three years of data provides better results. The data itself works best when there is variation in the values. If the data contains all constant data, such as a lease expense, the training may fail because the lack of variation doesnâ€™t require AI to project the amounts.
