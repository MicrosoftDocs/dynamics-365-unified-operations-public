This topic explains how to turn on the Budget proposal feature in Finance Insights.

1. Use information from the environment page in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to connect to the primary instance of Azure SQL for that environment. Run the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command to turn on flights for the sandbox environment. (You might have to turn on access for your IP address in LCS before you can connect remotely to Application Object Server \[AOS\].)

    `INSERT INTO SYSFLIGHTING (FLIGHTNAME, ENABLED) VALUES ('BudgetIntelligentBudgetRegisterProposalFeature', 1)`

    > [!NOTE]
    > Skip this step if you're using version 10.0.20 or later, or if you're using a Service Fabric deployment. The Finance insights team should already have turned on the flight for you. If you don't see the feature in the **Feature management** workspace, or if you experience issues when you try to turn it on, contact <fiap@microsoft.com>.

2. Open the **Feature management** workspace, and follow these steps:

    1. Select **Check for updates**.
    2. Search for **Budget proposal**, and turn on that feature.

3. Go to **Budgeting \> Setup \> basic Budgeting \> Budget proposal (preview)**, and select **Enable feature**.
