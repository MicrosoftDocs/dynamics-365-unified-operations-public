# Enable customer payment predictions

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure the Customer payment predictions feature on the **Finance insights configuration** page. This article also includes information that can help you effectively use the feature.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you complete the following steps, be sure to complete the prerequisite steps in the [Configure for Finance insights](configure-for-fin-insites.md) article.

    
> [!NOTE]
> ⚠️ **Important: Data Requirements for Customer Payment Predictions**
>
> To successfully train the predictions model, your environment must contain **at least 100 settled customer transactions** from the past **6 to 9 months**.  
>
> These 100+ transactions must be distributed across **all three buckets**:
> - **On-time**: At least 30 transactions
> - **Late**: At least 30 transactions
> - **Very late**: At least 30 transactions
>
> ✅ Transactions can include:
> - **Free text invoices**
> - **Sales orders**
> - **Customer payments**
>
> ❌ If these data conditions are not met, the prediction model will **not** train properly.
1. Configure the Customer payment insights feature:

    1. Go to **Credit and collections \> Setup \> Finance insights \> Customer payment predictions**.
    2. On the **Finance insights configuration** page, on the **Customer payment predictions** tab, select **View the data fields used in the prediction model** to open the **Data fields for prediction model** page. There, you can view the default list of fields that are used to create the artificial intelligence (AI) prediction model for customer payment predictions.

        To use the default list of fields to create the prediction model, close the **Data fields for prediction model** page, and then, on the **Finance insights configuration** page, set the **Enable feature** option to **Yes**.
     

    2. Specify the "very late" transaction period to define what the **Very late** prediction bucket means for your business.

        For each open invoice, the system predicts the probability of payment in three buckets: **On time**, **Late**, and **Very late**.

        - **On time** – This bucket includes payments that are predicted to be paid on or before the transaction due date.
        - **Late** – This bucket includes payments that are predicted to be paid after the transaction due date but before the start of the "very late" transaction period.
        - **Very late** – This bucket includes payments that are predicted to be paid after the start of the "very late" transaction period.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you change the "very late" transaction period and select **Change late threshold** after the AI prediction model for customer payments has been created, the existing prediction model is deleted, and a new model is created. The new prediction model will move transactions into the "very late" period, based on the settings that were entered to define it.

    3. After you've finished defining the "very late" transaction period, select **Create prediction model** to create the prediction model. The **Prediction model** section on the **Finance insights configuration** page shows the status of the prediction model.

        > [!NOTE]
        > At any time while the prediction model is being created, you can select **Reset model creation** to restart the process.

    The feature has now been configured and is ready to be used.

After the feature has been configured, and the prediction model has been created and is working, the **Prediction model** section of the **Finance insights parameters** page shows the accuracy of the model.
