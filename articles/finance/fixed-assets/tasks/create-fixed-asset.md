# Create a fixed asset

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to create a new fixed asset record from the **Fixed asset** list page.

The system assigns the asset number, based on the number sequence that is assigned to the fixed asset group. If you use the fixed asset template to import assets via the Microsoft Excel add-in, or if you use another import job, the system automatically creates fixed asset records and increments the asset number.

To manually create an asset record, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Navigation pane \> Modules \> Fixed assets \> Fixed assets \> Fixed assets**.
2. On the **Action pane**, select **New**.
3. In **the Fixed asset group** field, enter or select a value. The **Number** field will default if you have enabled **Autonumber fixed assets functionality** in the **Fixed assets parameters** and the **Fixed asset group**. If not, you must enter a unique number to identify the fixed asset.
4. In the **Name** field, enter a value. Enter the additional information that your business needs for this asset.
5. On the **Action pane**, select **Books**.
6. In the **Acquisition date** field, enter a date.
7. In the **Acquisition price** field, enter a number.

    - Enter the additional information that your business needs for this book.
    - Enter the additional information that your business needs for the remaining books.

8. Close the page.

You can also import fixed assets by using the Excel add-in or by running an import job from the **Data management** workspace. Before you run the import, enter the values for required fields in the template.

If you didn't define the fixed asset number in the template of the Excel add-in, or in Data management, the system creates a fixed asset number for each imported asset and automatically increments the number sequence for each. However, if you import assets and define asset numbers in the template, the system does **not** automatically increment the number sequence. In this case, an admin might have to manually update the number sequence. If you defined the fixed asset number in the template of the Excel add-in, the system uses the defined fixed asset number and increments the number sequence.

> After posting the depreciation, the **Placed in service** and **Depreciation run date** fields will be locked on the **Book** page. Also, both neither field will be updated from the data entity.

> [!WARNING]
> The fixed asset record won't be deleted if transactions were posted to the associated book, or if the newly created fixed asset is entered on a journal line but not posted.
