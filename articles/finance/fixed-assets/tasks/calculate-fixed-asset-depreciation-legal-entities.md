[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Fixed asset depreciation can be run across legal entities in a single step. This procedure shows you to how set up and run the process for multiple legal entities. It uses the accountant role and demo data for the USMF legal entity.


## Set up cross company depreciation run journals
1. Go to Fixed assets > Setup > Fixed assets parameters.
2. Expand the Fixed asset proposals section.
3. Click Add.
4. In the Posting layer field, enter or select a value.
5. In the Journal name field, enter or select a value.
    * Repeat the journal setup on the Fixed asset parameters page in each legal entity.  

## Depreciation run
1. Go to Fixed assets > Journal entries > Create depreciation proposal.
2. In the Posting layer field, enter or select a value.
    * The journal name will default from the Fixed asset parameters. It can be changed here for the current legal entity.  
3. In the To date field, enter a date.
    * Select the legal entities to be included in the depreciation run.  
    * Only legal entities with journals set up for Fixed asset proposals on the Fixed asset parameters page will be shown in the list.  
4. Select Yes in the Post journals field.
    * Filtering fields include all fixed assets, groups, and books for the legal entities selected for this depreciation run.  
    * The Batch processing option is enabled by default. When this option is enabled, the depreciation journal creation and posting will run in the background.  
5. Click Create journal.
