# Change a fixed asset group

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Fixed assets should be assigned to the correct fixed assets group. The fixed assets group is used when you:

 - Create inquiries and reports
 - Set up new fixed assets
 - Integrate ledgers and post fixed asset transactions to the appropriate ledger accounts

The following steps use the **USMF** demo company.

1. Go to **Fixed assets** > **Fixed assets** > **Fixed assets**.
2. Select the fixed asset you would like to change the fixed asset group on.
3. Select **Change fixed asset group**.
4. In the **New group** field, enter or select a value.
5. Select this option to assign a fixed asset number to the selected fixed asset.
   
   The **Fixed asset number** field is available if you select **New fixed asset number**. If automatic numbering is set up for fixed assets, this field shows the next available fixed asset number. You can change the number. If manual numbering is set up, this field is blank and you must enter the new fixed asset number.     

6. Select **OK**.
7. Select **Yes**.
