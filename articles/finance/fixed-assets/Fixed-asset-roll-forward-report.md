# Fixed assets roll forward report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The **Fixed assets roll forward** report provides, in an easy-to-read Microsoft Excel format, the detailed fixed asset data that you require for period closing, financial statements, and tax reporting. The report includes start and end balances for fixed assets, together with valuation movements for the period, and any new asset acquisitions and disposals that occurred during the period. Data is reported for individual fixed assets, and values are also summarized for fixed asset groups and the legal entity.

The **Fixed assets roll forward** report uses the Electronic reporting (ER) framework. Before you can run the report, the Fixed assets model and Fixed asset roll-forward configurations must be imported from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For instructions, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs).

This report is available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3, or as a hotfix for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017). Three hotfixes must be applied to environments that have the July 2017 release:

- **KB 4041754:** Electronic reporting (ER) configuration can't be downloaded from LCS as not applicable for the current version after applying the platform update package
- **KB 4056107:** Electronic reporting (GER) cumulative update 5
- **KB 4056353:** Fixed assets Statement and Notes reports don't meet the requirements in GAAP and IFRS

The following table describes the fields that are available on the report.
