# Expense management overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use Expense management to create an integrated workflow where you can store payment method information, import credit card transactions, and track the money that employees spend when they incur expenses for your business. You can also define expense policies and automate the reimbursement of travel expenses.

For more information, see [Configure expense management](plan-expense-management.md).

## Additional resources

### What's new and in development

To see what new features are planned, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 release plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010158).

#### Expense report entry

Expense report entry has been redesigned to simplify the experience and decrease the time that is required to complete expense reports. You can turn on this functionality in Feature management. You can add a new setup page to configure the visibility of expense fields, and specify what data is required, optional, or not available when expense reports are entered. When this functionality is turned on, a new expense workspace is available. This workspace replaces the previous expense workspace and is the landing page for the improved entry experience.

For more information, see [Expense reports reimagined](ExpenseWorkspaceNew.md).
