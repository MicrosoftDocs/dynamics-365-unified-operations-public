# Invoice capture solution

This article provides information about the Invoice capture solution that automatically creates vendor invoices from digital invoice images.

The Accounts payable (AP) department manages and processes invoices for goods and services that are received. The AP accountant verifies data on vendor invoices for the following reasons:

- To avoid extra effort if adjustments or corrections are required during period close
- To pay vendor invoices in a timely manner and prevent financial loss because of error or fraud

Optical character recognition (OCR) has become widely used by different industries in past years. It's now common for printed texts to be digitized, so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, and displayed online. The digital text can be used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, text-to-speech, key data, and text mining.

The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled modern OCR solutions to read different invoice formats from different vendors without requiring much human intervention. More companies are recognizing that they can save effort and improve accuracy by processing invoices via automation instead of doing manual processing.
