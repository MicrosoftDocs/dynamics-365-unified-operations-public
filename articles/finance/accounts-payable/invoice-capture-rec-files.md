# Invoice capture received files

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include [preview banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

In Invoice capture, the **Received files** page is a central place where invoice files are received from different sources.

## Upload invoice files

Accounts Payable (AP) clerks can upload invoice images by selecting **Upload a file** to open the **Upload** dialog box. After an AP clerk selects a file, the **Upload** button becomes available.

## Include or obsolete invoice files

Users can select invoices that have errors or warnings, and then either include or obsolete the invoices by selecting the corresponding button on the Action Pane. An invoice that is marked as obsolete won't appear in the **Received files (Obsoleted)** view.

## View captured invoices

After a received file is successfully recognized, the captured invoice's information is returned by the AI model and entered in Microsoft Dataverse. The AP clerk can then verify the invoice details by selecting **View captured invoice**. Users can download the original invoice file as required.
