# Generate invoice lines when you import vendor invoices

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the functionality for automatically generating invoice lines on vendor invoices when invoices are imported.

Sometimes, vendor invoices only contains some header information without line details and the vendor always sends the invoices with a fixed patterns:
1. Invoices always contains the same lines as aligned with purchase order. 
2. Invoices always contains the same lines based on the good they shipped and the price will follow the one defined on the purchase order. 

To streamline the process, the invocie line can be automatically derived from the purchase order or product receipt. To enable automatic creation of invoice lines, follow these steps.

1.	Go to **Accounts payable \> Setup \> Accounts payable parameters**.
2.	On the **Vendor invoice automation** tab, under **Automatic line creation for imported invoices**, set the **Automatically create invoice lines** option to **Yes**. 
4.	In the **Choose default quantity for automatic invoice lines creation** field, select the quantity that should be used to automatically generate invoice lines:

    - **Ordered quantity** – Lines are generated from purchase order lines. This value is the default value.
    - **Product receipt quantity** – The purchase order number is used to find the relevant product receipts. It will then use the product receipt quantities to generate invoice lines.
  
    This parameter is only used when the purchase order number range is specified during invoice import without product receipt range. If the product receipt range is given, the line will always be derived from the product receipt instead of the purchase order. 
5. Parameter **"Allow invoice to be imported with no derived lines"** decides whether the invoice import will be blocked when there is no derived invoice lines. 

## Data entity changes

To support the functionality that is described in this article, the **Vendor invoice header** data entity has been enhanced. Three fields have been added:

- **HeaderOnlyImport** – This field must be set to **Yes** to generate lines for invoice headers.
- **PurchIdRange** – The list of purchase order numbers. The invoice numbers can be a range, such as **PO0001..PO0009** (where two dots separate the start and end of the range), or discrete values, such as **PO0001,PO0003,PO0006**. All purchase orders must belong to the same vendor account on the invoice header. Otherwise, you will receive the following error message: "Failed to generate invoice lines. Purchase orders have different vendor accounts."
- **PackingslipRange** – The list of product receipt numbers. Vendor invoice lines can be created from product receipts. However, product receipt numbers aren't typically included on vendor invoices. Only enter the product receipt numbers into this field if you can clearly identify which product receipts are for which specific invoices. Invoice lines can be generated based on product receipts. If this field is used, the setting of the **Choose default quantity for automatic invoice lines creation** field on the **Accounts payable parameters** page is ignored. 

**Limitation**: If you enter multiple product receipt numbers, several pending vendor invoices are created with the same invoice number. You must consolidate them manually before processing the invoice further. In future releases, we plan to consolidate the invoices automatically, so the limitation is removed.

All product receipts must belong to the same vendor account on the invoice header.

## Result

If lines are successfully generated, the following message is logged in the vendor invoice automation history: "Automatically create invoice lines: Succeeded."

If lines don't generate, the following error message is logged: "Automatically create invoice lines: Failed."


## Import prepayment invoice

The prepayment invoice can be imported directly via data entity **Vendor invoice header** when the parameter **Automatically create invoice lines** is enabled.
- **HeaderOnlyImport** – Set to **Yes** to generate lines for prepayment invoice.
- **PurchIdRange** - The **Purchase order number** that set the prepayment amount.
- **VENDORINVOICETYPE** - This is **"VendorAdvance"** to indicate a prepayment invoice.
- **IMPORTEDAMOUNT** - The **Amount** on the prepayment invoice.

The import of a prepayment invoice isn't accepted when the prepayment invoice has already been generated without a settlement under the purchase order.

## Import purchase order number

When a vendor invoice is associated with a single purchase order, the purchase order number (PurchId) is given in vendor invoice header entity to support the following:

 - Currency code derivation and validation - The currency code is automatically derived from the purchase order if the currency code is not given in the vendor invoice header entity. The validation error is raised when the imported invoice has a different currency code against the one specified on the purchase order. 

 - Financial dimension defaulting - The invoice header's financial dimension values will be derived from the purchase order header. The corresponding financial dimension on the invoice lines is derived from the vendor invoice header during the invoice lines importing process. This ensures the consistencies between the invoice imported via DMF and the invoice created by pending vendor invoice page.

 - Vendor invoice workflow - If the invoice validation fails, the invoice is redirected to the purchase order originator to address any discrepancies. The correct purchase order number ensures the vendor invoice is redirected to the right purchase order originator during the workflow process.
