# Import currency exchange rates

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

If a legal entity has received invoices in foreign currencies, the foreign currency must be converted into the local currency. This means that up-to-date exchange rates for different currencies are required. This article provides an overview of the settings and processing required to import foreign exchange reference rates that are published by exchange rate providers, such as OANDA Rates速, the European Central Bank, the Central Bank of Russia, and the Central Bank of the Republic of T端rkiye (CBRT).

>[!NOTE]
>Beginning in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.41, a new rate provider option, **OANDA Central Banks**, is available with an upgraded license key from OANDA. 

The following sections describe the flow of information that is used for setting up and processing the import of foreign exchange rates.

## Configure an exchange rate provider
Before you can import exchange rates, you must set up the information that is required by the providers who offer the exchange rates. Use the **Configure exchange rate providers** page to select the exchange rate providers. Some exchange rate providers are included with the demo data in Dynamics 365 Finance. The following table provides descriptions for the controls on this page. 

| Field | Description                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Name**  | The name of the exchange rate provider.                                                                                                          |
| **Key**   | The **Key** column is a unique identifier for each piece of configuration information that is required by the provider. This information is automatically added for each exchange rate provider that you add. |
| **Value** | The **Value** column is the required information for each key. This information is added for each exchange rate provider that you add. |

You must configure specific information, depending on the provider that you select.

### OANDA

OANDA provider options require that you fill in the API key values that you receive directly from OANDA. The *OANDA Central Banks* provider lets you select a specific central bank value in the **Data set key** field.

### Central Bank of the Republic of T端rkiye

Central Bank of the Republic of T端rkiye (CBRT) announces indicative exchange rates at 3:30 PM on working days. Those rates are then applicable on the following working day. Therefore, exchange rates should be imported from CBRT daily. No exchange rate information is provided on weekends or official holidays.

The configuration enables exchange rates to be imported for four different exchange rate types that CBRT provides:

- Banknote buying
- Banknote selling
- Forex buying
- Forex selling

Cross rates can be imported with currency exchange rates if the value of the **Cross rate** key of the CBRT provider is **Yes**. 
The cross rates will have the same exchange rate type selected on the **Import currency exchange rates** dialog page.

>[!NOTE]
>If cross rates aren't imported, an error message is generated during ledger posting. To ensure that cross rates are correctly imported, the value of the **Cross rate** key is set to **Yes** by default in the configuration of the CBRT provider.

| **Key** | **Value** |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------|                        
| **Banknote buying** | Specify the exchange rate type for *Banknote buying*. |
| **Banknote selling** | Specify the exchange rate type for *Banknote selling*. |
| **Cross rate** | If the parameter is set to **Yes**, cross rates are imported in addition to currency exchange rates.|
| **Decimal places** | Specify the number of digits in the exchange rate. The default value is *4*. |
| **Forex buying** | Specify the exchange rate type for *Forex buying*. |
| **Forex selling** | Specify the exchange rate type for *Forex selling*. |
| **ServiceOnDateUrl** | Specify the URL information to be used to download exchange rates from CBRT. |


## Import currency exchange rates
You can import exchange rates from the exchange rate providers source and add them to the **Currency exchange rates** page. Use the **Import currency exchange rates** page to import the exchange rates. The following table provides descriptions of the fields that are required to successfully complete the import process.

| Field | Description                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Exchange rate type**                 | An exchange rate type.                                                                          |
| **Exchange rate provider**             | An exchange rate provider.                                                                                                             |
| **Import as of**                       | This parameter manages whether to import as of the current date or for a specific date range. If you want to use a date range, enter or select the start and end dates.  |
| **Create necessary currency pairs**    | This checkbox manages the automatic creation of currency pairs, if the currency pairs that are imported do not exist. This option might not be available for some providers.                |
| **Override existing exchange rates**   | This checkbox manages the update of the existing exchange rate for a currency pair when the exchange rate for a specific date already exists. If you don't select this checkbox, the exchange rate for the specific dates is not imported if another exchange rate already exists.                                                                                       |
| **Prevent import on national holiday** | This checkbox manages the import of the exchange rate for public holiday's date. For example, if you select this checkbox and use the European Central Bank as the exchange rate provider, the system will not update the exchange rate on a public holiday that is related to the current legal entity. This option might not be available for some providers. |
| **Rate from the previous day** | This checkbox is only available for the provider, *Central Bank of Europe*. Select this checkbox to import the currency exchange rate that is published by the European Central Bank on the previous working day at approximately 16:00 CET. By default, the checkbox is selected. Clear this checkbox to import the currency exchange rate that is published on the same working day. This option might not be available for some providers.  
>[!NOTE]
> The import process loads the rates from the previous day and records them for the current day. |
