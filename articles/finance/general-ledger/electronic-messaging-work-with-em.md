# Work with the Electronic messages functionality

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

If you're working at the message level, the **Electronic messages** page (**Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic messages**) is more useful. If you're working at the data collection or message item level, the **Electronic message items** page (**Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Electronic messages** \> **Electronic message items**) is more useful.

## Electronic messages

The **Electronic messages** page presents the processing that is available to you, based on your role. Security roles are associated with processing in the setup of that processing. For each processing that is available to you, the page shows electronic messages and information that is related to them.

The **Messages** FastTab shows electronic messages for the selected processing. Depending on the status of the selected message and predefined processing, you can run some actions by using the buttons above the grid:

- **New** – This button is associated with actions of the **Create message** type.
- **Delete** – This button is available if the **Allow delete** checkbox is selected for the current status of the selected message.
- **Collect data** – This button is associated with actions of the **Populate records** type.
- **Generate report** – This button is associated with actions of the **Electronic reporting export message** type.
- **Send report** – This button is associated with actions of the **Web service** type.
- **Import response** – This button is associated with actions of the **Electronic reporting import** type.
- **Update status** – This button is associated with actions of the **Message level user processing** type.
- **Message items** – Open the **Electronic message items** page.

The **Action log** FastTab shows information about all the actions that have been run for the selected message. If an action caused an error, information about the error is attached to the related line in the grid. To review the information about the error, select the line in the grid, and then select the **Attachment** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner on the page.

The **Message additional fields** FastTab shows all the additional fields that are defined for messages in the processing setup. The FastTab also includes the values of those additional fields.

The **Message items** FastTab shows all the message items that are related to the selected message. Depending on the status of the selected message item, you can run some actions by using the buttons above the grid:

- **Delete** – This button is available if the **Allow delete** checkbox is selected for the current status of the selected message item.
- **Update status** – This button is associated with actions of the **User processing** type.
- **Original document** – Open a page that shows the original document for the selected message item.

The reports that have already been generated and received for a message are attached to that message. To review the attachments related to a message, select the message, and then select the **Attachment** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page.

The **Attachments** page shows the attachments that are related to the selected message. To view a file, select it in the list on the left, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Open**.

You can review attachments that are related to a specific action that was previously run for a message. On the **Electronic messages** page, on the **Messages** FastTab, select the message. On **Action log** FastTab, select the action, and then select the **Attachment** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page.

You can run the whole processing or just a specific action by selecting **Run processing** on the Action Pane.

## Electronic message items

The **Electronic message items** page shows all message items and a log of the actions that have been run for each message item. The page also shows the additional fields that are defined for the message items, and the values of those additional fields.

The following table describes the fields on the **Message items** tab.

<table>
<thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Processing</td>
<td>The name of the processing that was used to create the message item.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Message item date</td>
<td>The date when the message item was created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Message item type</td>
<td>The type of message item. Several types of messages items can be set up for the same processing (for example, <b>Incoming invoices</b> and <b>Outgoing invoices</b>). This field can be automatically set only when an invoice is added to the Message items table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Message item status</td>
<td><p>The actual status of the message item. The available statuses vary, depending on the type of message item. Here are some examples:</p>

<li><b>Evaluated</b> – Additional attributes were calculated for the message item.</li>
<li><b>Reported</b> – The message item was successfully added to a report.</li>

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>For processing that automatically transmits a generated report outside the system, the date when the message item was transmitted.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account number</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Next action</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The **Additional fields** tab shows the additional fields for the selected message item, and their values.

### Run processing

On the Action Pane, select **Run processing** to run the processing for message items. To run a specific action, in the **Run processing** dialog box, set the **Choose action** option to **Yes**, and then select an action. To run the whole processing, leave the **Choose action** option set to **No**.

### Generate report

On the Action Pane, select **Generate report**. This button is associated with actions of the **Electronic reporting export** type.

### Update status

On the Action Pane, select **Update status** to update the status of one or more message items. In the **Update status** dialog box, use the **Records to include** FastTab to select the message items to update. Make sure that you correctly define the selection criteria, because message item statuses will be updated according to these criteria, the initial status of the selected action, and the value that you specify in the **New status** field. After a status update is completed, it will be difficult to determine which items were updated. Therefore, it will be difficult to roll back the status update.

### Electronic messages

On the Action Pane, select **Electronic messages** to review an electronic message that is related to the selected message item.

You can also review the files that are related to a specific message item. Select the **Message** field for the message item or, on the Action Pane, select **Electronic messages**. On the **Electronic message** page, select the message to review files for, and then select the **Attachment** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page.

The **Attachments** page shows the attachments that are related to the message. To view a file, select it in the list on the left, and then select **Open** on the Action Pane.

### Original document

On the Action Pane, select **Original document** to open the original document for the selected message item.
