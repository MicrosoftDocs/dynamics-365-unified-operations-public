# Define financial dimensions

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This procedure shows how to add an entity backed financial dimension and a custom financial dimension. The guide uses the USMF demo company.

## Create an entity backed financial dimension
1. Go to **Navigation pane > Modules > General ledger > Chart of accounts > Dimensions > Financial dimensions**.
2. Click **New**.
3. In the **User values form** field, select a system-defined entity to base the financial dimension on. 
4. In the **Dimension name** field, type a value to describe the financial dimension. The name can be different than the system-defined entity but cannot contain spaces or special characters.
5. Click **Activate**. Activating the financial dimension updates the table with the financial dimension name and removes deleted dimensions. You can enter dimension values before you activate a financial dimension, but a financial dimension cannot be used until it is activated.  
6. Click **Close** on the activation message.
7. Click **Activate**. Dimension activation can be scheduled to run by batch at a specific date and time.  
8. On **Action pane**, click **Dimension values**. Some dimension values are company specific. You can verify if they are company specific by if the company name is showing in the dimension values list.  

## Create a custom financial dimension
1. Click **New**.
2. In the **Use values from** field, select **Custom dimension**.
3. In the **Dimension name** field, type a value to describe the financial dimension.
    - The name cannot contain spaces or special characters.  
    - You can also specify an account mask to limit the amount and type of information that you can enter for dimension values.   
    - You can enter characters that remain the same for each dimension value, such as letters or a hyphen. You can also enter number signs (#) and ampersands (&) as placeholders for letters and numbers that will change every time that a dimension value is created. Use a number sign (#) as a placeholder for a number and an ampersand (&) as a placeholder for a letter.  Example: To limit the dimension value to the letters CC and three numbers, you enter CC-### as the format mask.  
4. Click **Activate**. Activating the financial dimension updates the table with the financial dimension name and removes deleted dimensions. You can enter dimension values before you activate a financial dimension, but a financial dimension cannot be used until it is activated.     
5. Click **Activate**. Dimension activation can be scheduled to run by batch at a specific date and time.      
6. On **Action pane**, click **Dimension values**.
7. Click **New**.
8. In the **Dimension value** field, type a name to describe your financial dimension value.
9. In the **Description** field, type a description that describes your financial dimension value.
