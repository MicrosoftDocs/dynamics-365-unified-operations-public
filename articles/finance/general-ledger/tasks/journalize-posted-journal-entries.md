# Journalize posted journal entries

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The journalize process in the general ledger provides a way to group and report on posted voucher entries for your general ledger. Based on the criteria provided, a list of vouchers is generated that uses a unique number sequence and that has the general ledger **Journal number** value as a reference.

Follow these steps to journalize posted journal entries. This procedure uses the **USMF** demo data company.

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Ledger setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.
2. In the **Extended ledger journal** field, select a value. If you select **Yes**, the report output is different.
3. Select whether the period can be closed if the journalizing process hasn't been run. If you select **Yes**, the period can't be closed until the journalizing process has been completed for that period.
4. Close the page.
5. Go to **General ledger** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Journalizing**, and select **Filter**.
6. Select the row for the filter criteria that you want to define.
7. In the **Criteria** field, enter or select the filter criteria.
8. Select **OK** to close the page.
9. Select **OK** to start the journalizing process. A report will be generated after the process is completed.
