# One voucher FAQ

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article answers frequently asked questions about the One voucher functionality. One voucher for financial journals lets you enter multiple subledger transactions in the context of a single voucher. The journals that you can include in that voucher can be general journals, fixed asset journals, and vendor payment journals, among others.

## When will the One voucher functionality be deprecated?

Although Microsoft can't provide an accurate estimate about when the One voucher functionality will be deprecated, it will likely be at least two years before the deprecation occurs.

As is noted in the One voucher documentation, numerous business requirements can be met only by using One voucher. Microsoft must ensure that all the identified business requirements can still be met in the system after the functionality is deprecated. Therefore, new features will probably have to be added to fill functional gaps.

After all functional gaps are filled, Microsoft will communicate that the feature will be deprecated. However, the deprecation won't be effective for least one year after that communication.

For more information, see the [One voucher documentation](one-voucher.md).

## What will the solution that replaces One voucher look like?

Microsoft can't provide a specific solution, because each feature gap is different and must be evaluated based on the business requirements. Some functional gaps will likely be replaced with features that help meet specific business requirements. However, other gaps might be filled by continuing to allow for entry in a journal, as when One voucher is used, but enhancing the system to track more detail as required.

## Where can I track the progress of the feature gaps being filled?

As for every new feature, customers must watch the Release plan and "What's new or changed" documentation. Each feature will be added to these documents, and a note will indicate that the feature is required to meet a business requirement that previously required the One voucher functionality.

## When the deprecation date is identified, where will it be communicated?

The deprecation of One voucher is a significant change that will be widely communicated. It will be communicated through the product documentation, a blog post, and announcements at applicable Microsoft conferences, well in advance of the date when the deprecation takes effect.
