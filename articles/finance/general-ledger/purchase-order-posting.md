# Purchase order posting

The **Purchase order** tab on the **Inventory posting profiles** page is used to control how purchase orders will post to the general ledger. Two main activities post to the general ledger for a purchase order: 

- Product receipt
- Invoice

For a physical transaction (product receipt) to post to the general ledger on a purchase order, the following checkboxes must be selected:

- The **Post product receipt in ledger** checkbox on the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page.
- The **Post physical inventory** and **Accrue liability on product receipt** checkboxes on the **Item model groups** page.

The main accounts must be specified in the **Inventory posting profile** page for the following posting types:

- Cost of purchases materials received
- Purchase expenditure, uninvoiced
- Purchase, accrual

For a financial transaction (invoice) to post to the general ledger on a purchase order, the following conditions must be met:

- The **Post financial inventory** checkbox must be selected in the **Item model groups** page for the item selected on the purchase order line.
- The main accounts must be specified in the **Inventory posting profile** page for the following posting types:
  - Cost of purchased materials invoiced
  - Purchase expenditure for product
  - Purchase expenditure for expense
  - Discount (optional)

## Fixed receipt price posting

You can use fixed receipt price as the standard cost for a product as an alternative to selecting the **Standard cost** option in the **Inventory model** field on the **Item model groups** page for an item. The main difference is that when **Fixed receipt price** is used, the current cost price will be used for the item when the inventory receipt is posted. There's no cost revaluation process for **Fixed receipt price**; when a financial update is posted, the current cost price is used at the time of posting. If there's a difference between the cost price used at receipt and invoice, the variance will post to the fixed receipt price profit and loss accounts.

To use a fixed receipt price for a product, you must configure the following:

- On the **Item model groups** page, select the **Post physical inventory** and the **Fixed receipt price** checkboxes. 
- On the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page, select the **Post packing slip in ledger** checkbox.
- On the **Inventory posting profile** page, specify the main accounts for the following posting types:
  - Fixed receipt price profit
  - Fixed receipt price loss
  - Fixed receipt price offset

For more information, go to [Fixed receipt price](/supply-chain/cost-management/fixed-receipt-price.md).

## Purchase charges and stock variation posting

If you plan to account for purchase charges and stock variations, do the following:

- On the **Accounts payable parameters** page on the **Invoice** tab, select the **Post to charge account in ledger** checkbox.
- On the **Item model groups** page for the item selected on the purchase order line, select the **Post physical inventory**, **Post financial inventory**, and **Accrue liability on product receipt** checkboxes.
- On the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page, select the **Generate charges on product receipt** checkbox.
- On the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page, select the **Post packing slip in ledger** checkbox.

On the **Inventory posting profile** page, you must specify the main accounts for the following posting types:

- Purchase expenditure, uninvoiced
- Purchase expenditure for product
- Stock variation

> [!NOTE]
> The **Charge** posting type isn't used when the **Post to charge account in ledger** parameter is selected.

For more information, go to [Post to charge account accounting principle](/supply-chain/cost-management/post-to-charge-account-accounting-principle.md).

## Sample posting profile configuration

The following table shows examples of the default posting types with sample main accounts and descriptions:

- The **Clearing account** column indicates that the posting type is a clearing account. The amount posted in this account is automatically reversed when a later transaction is posted. 
- The **P/F** column indicates **P** for physical posting and **F** for financial posting. 
- The **Follow** column indicates if the main account for a specific posting type is typically the same as another posting type. The value in the column indicates the posting type that's typically used.

> [!NOTE]
> The main accounts and main account names are only suggestions. We recommend<!--note from editor: Via Writing Style Guide.--> that you work with your accountant to determine the best configuration for your business needs.

## Fixed asset posting with purchase orders

If you use the **Fixed assets** module and plan to purchase fixed assets through purchase orders, you must configure the **Fixed asset receipt** posting type on the **Purchase order** tab of the **Inventory posting profile** page. For more information, go to [Fixed assets integration](/fixed-assets/fixed-asset-integration.md) and [Create and acquire assets from Accounts payable](/fixed-assets/tasks/create-acquire-assets-accounts-payable.md).

## Prepayment purchase order invoice posting

If you plan to use the **Prepayment invoice** feature for purchase orders, the **Prepayment** posting type must be selected on the **Purchase order** tab on the **Inventory posting profile** page. For more information, go to [Prepayment invoices vs. prepayments](/accounts-payable/prepayments-invoices-vs-prepayments.md).

## Purchase requisition and purchase order confirmation posting

Purchase requisitions and purchase order confirmations can also be configured to post pre-encumbrances and encumbrances to the general ledger. These postings are controlled by a posting definition. For more information, go to [About purchase order encumbrances](/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/about-purchase-order-encumbrances).

## Procurement category posting

As an alternative to setting up the inventory posting for all items, a group of items, or a single item, you can set up categories and control the ledger posting by procurement categories. For more information about setting up categories and assigning them to products, go to [Sample posting profile configuration](#sample-posting-profile-configuration) earlier in this article.

When using categories with purchase orders or vendor invoices, the category hierarchy needs to be assigned to the **Procurement category hierarchy** type on the **Category hierarchy role assignments** page.

### Vendor invoices with procurement categories

If your organization uses purchases orders for some purchases and not for others, you can process non–purchase order related invoices in a variety of ways. This includes using journals in **Accounts payable** or by the **Pending vendor invoices** page that's used to generate invoices for purchase orders. When creating invoices for non–purchase order related invoices, you'll need to create procurement categories for each type of expense. You'll need to map the category to the correct expense account on the **Inventory posting profiles** page.

The exact number of categories will vary based on the number of expense accounts that you use to post your invoices. You'll need at least one procurement category for each main account that you expense non–purchase order invoices to. Many categories can be used for a single main account. This can be useful for usability, searchability, and reporting the types of expenses you use.

### Benefits of using procurement categories for vendor invoices

Some benefits of using procurement categories for vendor invoices include:

- Consistent user experience: When you configure procurement categories for all non–purchase order related expenses, users can be trained on one process for invoicing by using the **Pending vendor invoices** page.
- Improved reporting experience: When you configure procurement categories for all items and all non–purchase order related expenses, the procurement spend report will analyze the spend by vendor, category, and more.
- Consistent workflow: When you use **Pending vendor invoices** to process all invoices, you can create a consistent workflow and approval process by using a single workflow.

## Consignment inventory posting

Consignment inventory uses the same ledger posting as other purchased items. The key difference is that when the inventory is received, no ledger transactions are recorded. To transfer ownership to the organization when an **Inventory ownership change** journal is posted, a voucher is generated to record the cost of the item. For more information, go to [Set up consignment](/supply-chain/inventory/consignment.md).
