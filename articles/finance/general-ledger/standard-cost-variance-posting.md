# Standard cost variance posting

When you use standard costing for one or more products in your organization, you must configure the [prerequisites for standard costing](/supply-chain/cost-management/prerequisites-standard-costs.md). This article explains the posting accounts that are required for step 3 of the prerequisites, "Assign ledger accounts to item postings that are related to standard cost variances."

Different types of variances can occur for purchases and production orders. For examples of production variances, see [Common sources of production variances](/supply-chain/cost-management/common-sources-of-production-variances.md). Purchase order price variances occur when you use standard cost for a purchased item, and there is a difference between the product's standard cost and the invoiced amount on the purchase order.

## Sample posting profile configuration

The following table shows examples of the default posting types. It includes sample main accounts and descriptions.

- The "Debit/Credit?" column indicates whether the transaction is typically a debit or a credit. In some case, the transaction can post either debits or credits.
- The "Clearing account" column indicates that the posting type is a clearing account. In other words, the amount that is posted in this account is automatically reversed when a later transaction is posted.
- The "P/F" column indicates the type of posting. "P" represents physical posting, and "F" represents financial posting.
- The "Follow" column indicates whether the main account for the posting type is typically the same as the main account for another posting type. Specifically, it indicates the posting type that is typically used.

> [!NOTE]
> The main accounts and main account names in the table are suggestions. We recommend that you work with your accountant to determine the best configuration for your business needs.
