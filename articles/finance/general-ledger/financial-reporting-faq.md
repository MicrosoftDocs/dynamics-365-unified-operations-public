# Financial reporting FAQ

This topic provides answers to frequently asked questions about Financial reporting.

## How do I restrict access to a report by using tree security?

The following example shows how to restrict access to a report by using tree security.

The USMF demo company has a **Balance sheet** report that not all Financial reporting users should have access to. You can use tree security to restrict access to a single report so that only specific users can access it.

1. Sign in to Financial Reporter Report Designer.
2. Select **File \> New \> Tree Definition** to create a new tree definition.
3. Double-tap (or double-click) the **Summary** line in the **Unit Security** column.
4. Select **Users and Groups**.
5. Select the users or groups that require access to the report.
6. Select **Save**.
7. In the report definition, add your new tree definition.
8. In the tree definition, select **Setting**. Then, under **Reporting unit selection**, select **Include all units**.

## How do I identify which accounts don't match my balances?

If you have a report that doesn't have matching balances, use the following procedures to identify each account and variance.

### In Financial Reporter Report Designer

1. Create a new row definition.
2. Select **Edit \> Insert Rows from Dimensions**.
3. Select **MainAccount**.
4. Select **OK**.
5. Save the row definition.
6. Create a new column definition.
7. Create a new report definition.
8. Select **Settings** and unmark this option.
9. Generate the report. 
10. Export the report to Microsoft Excel.

### In Dynamics 365 Finance

1. Go to **General ledger \> Inquiries and reports \> Trial balance**.
2. Set the following fields:

    - **From Date** – Enter the start date of the fiscal year.
    - **To Date** – Enter the date that you're generating the report for.
    - **Financial Dimension** – Set this field to **Main Account set**.

3. Select **Calculate**.
4. Export the report to Excel.

You should now be able to copy the data from the Financial Reporter Excel report to the **Trial Balance** report, so that you can compare the **Closing Balance** columns.

## When I design a report in Report Designer, or when I generate a financial report, I received the following message: "The operation could not be completed due to a problem in the data provider framework." How should I respond?

The message indicates that an issue occurred when the system tried to retrieve financial metadata from the data mart while you were using Financial reporting. There are two ways to respond to this issue:

- Review the integration status of the data by going to **Tools \> Integration status** in Report Designer. If the integration is incomplete, wait for it to be completed. Then retry what you were doing when you received the message.
- Contact Support to identify and work through the issue. There might be inconsistent data in the system. Support engineers can help you identify that issue on the server and find the specific data that might require an update.

## How does the selection of historical rate translation affect report performance?

The historical rate is typically used with retained earnings, property, plant and equipment, and equity accounts. The historical rate might be required, based on guidelines of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For more information, see [Currency capabilities in financial reporting](financial-reporting-currency-capability.md).

## How many types of currency rate are there?

There are three types:

- **Current rate** – This type is typically used with balance sheet accounts. It's usually known as the *spot exchange rate* and can be the rate on the last day of the month or another predetermined date.
- **Average rate** – This type is typically used with income statement (profit/loss) accounts. You can set up the average rate to do either a simple average or a weighted average.
- **Historical rate** – This type is typically used with retained earnings, property, plant and equipment, and equity accounts. These accounts might be required, based on FASB or GAAP guidelines.

## How does historical currency translation work?

Rates are specific to the transaction date. Therefore, each transaction is individually translated, based on the closest exchange rate.

For historical currency translation, the pre-calculated period balances can be used instead of individual transaction details. This behavior differs from the behavior for current rate translation.

## How does historical currency translation affect performance?

When data that is presented on the reports is updated, there might be a delay because amounts must be recalculated by checking transaction details. This delay is triggered every time that the rates are updated or more transactions are posted. For example, if thousands of accounts are set up for historical translation a couple times per day, there might be a delay of up to an hour before the data on the report is updated. On the other hand, if there is a smaller number of specific accounts, the processing times for updates to the report data can be reduced to minutes or less.

Likewise, when reports are generated by using currency translation for historical type accounts, there will be extra per-transaction calculations. Depending on the number of accounts, report generation time can more than double.
