# Financial reporting FAQ 

This topic provides answers to frequently asked questions about financial reporting. 

## How do I restrict access to a report using tree security?

The following example shows how to restrict access to a report using tree security.

The USMF demo company has a Balance sheet report that not all Financial reporting users should have access to. To restrict access, you can use tree security to restrict access to a single report so that only certain users can access the report. Follow these steps to restrict access: 

1. Sign in to Financial Reporter Report Designer.
2. Create a new tree definition. Go to **File > New > Tree Definition**.
3. Double-click the **Summary** line in the **Unit Security** column.
4. Select **Users and Groups**.  
5. Select the users or groups that need access to this report. 
6. Select **Save**.
7. In the report definition, add your new tree definition.
8. In the tree definition, select **Setting**. Under **Reporting unit selection**, select **Include all units**.

## How do I identify which accounts do not match my balances?

If you have a report that doesn't have matching balances, here are some steps you can take to identify each of the accounts and variances. 

**Financial Reporter Report Designer**
1. In Financial Reporter Report Designer, create a new row definition. 
2. Select **Edit > Insert Rows from Dimensions**.
3. Select **MainAccount**.  
4. Select **OK**.
5. Save the row definition.
6. Create a new column definition
7. Create a new report definition.
8. Select **Settings** and unmark this option.  
9. Generate the report. 
10. Export the report to Microsoft Excel.

**Dynamics 365 Finance** 
1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **General Ledger > Inquiries and Reports > Trial Balance**.
2. Set the following parameters:
   - **From Date** - Enter the start of the fiscal year.
   - **To Date** - Enter the date you are generating the report for.
   - **Financial Dimension** - Set this field to **Main Account set**.
 3. Select **Calculate**.
 4. Export the report to Microsoft Excel.

You should now be able to copy the data from the Financial Reporter Excel report to the Trial Balance report, so you can compare the **Closing Balance** columns.
