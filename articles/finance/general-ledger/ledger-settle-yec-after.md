# Awareness between ledger settlement feature after year-end close

## Preparing for the ledger settlement Awareness feature after year-end close

A major change of the **Awareness between ledger settlement and year end close** feature (the **Awareness** feature) is that ledger settlement can't be done across fiscal years. This cross-year limitation is relevant only to ledger settlement, not to Accounts receivable or Accounts payable settlements.

Before the **Awareness** feature is enabled, the fiscal year that will undergo the year-end close must not have any ledger transactions that are settled across fiscal years. Specifically, any transactions that were posted into the fiscal year that you're running the year-end close for must be unsettled from transactions that were posted into a different fiscal year. The transactions can then be resettled against transactions in the same fiscal year.

This article described the steps that are required to identify, unsettle, and resettle the ledger transactions that are settled across fiscal years. In the example that's provided, fiscal year 2022 has been closed. The focus is on preparing the ledger settlement transactions well before the 2023 year-end close is run.

## Example setup

The following illustration shows the transactions that were posted for main account 110190. The ledger transactions in green are settled in the same fiscal year and don't have to change. The transactions in red are ledger-settled, but they have transaction dates in different fiscal years. Those transactions must be identified, and the ledger settlement might have to be reversed.

## Example

Follow these steps if your organization wants to use the **Awareness** feature after the year-end close for fiscal year 2022 is run.

> [!NOTE]
> The year-end close for 2022 and earlier fiscal years must be rerun only if new transactions are posted into fiscal year 2022 or earlier. When you complete the following procedure, no new transactions should be posted into 2022. Therefore, the year-end close doesn't have to be rerun.
>
> Ledger transactions that are settled across fiscal years can remain ledger-settled if they aren't settled against a transaction that was posted into 2023 or later. For example, if you've settled transactions across 2019 and 2020, they can remain settled.

1. Complete the year-end close for 2022 without the **Awareness** feature enabled.
2. Optional: After the year-end close for 2022 has been completed, enable the **Awareness** feature. A year-end close is considered completed when all adjustments are posted and the year-end close process won't be run again.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **Awareness** feature must not be enabled if the year-end close for 2022 will be run again. The benefit of enabling the feature now is that you prevent users from settling ledger transactions that were posted into different fiscal years.

    If the year-end close hasn't been completed, you can still complete the next steps without enabling the **Awareness** feature. You'll enable the feature in a later step, as noted.

3. On the **Ledger settlement** page, identify the total of all the transactions that are settled across fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Note that 2021 transactions that are settled against 2022 transactions aren't relevant because 2022 has already been closed. Those transactions can remain settled.

    1. Specify a date range for all of fiscal year 2022. For example, specify January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, if you're using a calendar year as the fiscal year.
    2. In the **Status** field, select **Settled**.
    3. Filter on one ledger account at a time.

        - You'll have to repeat these steps for each ledger account that ledger settlement occurs for.
        - If other ledger accounts are no longer set up for ledger settlement, you might have to temporarily add them back to the ledger settlement setup. Then complete these steps if those ledger accounts have transactions in 2023 that are settled against transactions in 2022 or earlier.

    4. Select and hold (or right-click) in the **Status** column, and then select to group by this column.
    5. Select and hold (or right-click) in the **Amount in transaction currency** column, and then select to total this column.

        - If you settled transactions only in 2022, the total will be 0 (zero).
        - If you have transactions that were settled across fiscal years, the total won't be 0 (zero).

    6. Identify which transactions were settled between 2022 and 2023 by filtering on the **Settlement date** value. If you filter on a settlement date of January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2023, you get a total of $700, which is the total of transactions that were ledger settled across 2022 and 2023.

4. Repeat step 3 for fiscal year 2023. The total should match the $700 from 2022 because no 2023 transactions were settled against 2024 transactions.

5. If you enabled the **Awareness** feature in step 2, disable it before you move on to step 6. In the next steps, you'll reverse the ledger settlement that crossed fiscal years. If the **Awareness** feature is enabled, ledger settlement can't be reversed for fiscal year 2022. Therefore, you must disable the feature before you continue.
6. After the **Awareness** feature is disabled, use the same filters on the **Ledger settlement** page to reverse the ledger settlement of the detailed transactions.

    1. Return to the **Ledger settlement** page, and filter on transaction dates for 2023. Then find the detailed transactions that make up the $700 total. Filtering for this information might not be easy. You might have to send the data to Microsoft Excel to evaluate it.
    2. After you have the list of transactions, select the ledger transactions on the **Ledger settlement** page, and select **Mark selected**. You don't have to see both sides of the ledger transactions that were settled. If you mark either the debit or the credit, everything that has the same **Settlement ID** value will be reversed, even if the **Marked amount** value isn't **0** (zero).
    3. Select **Reverse marked transactions** to unsettle the transactions.

7. Post an adjusting general journal to split the opening balance for 2023 into two amounts: the portion that's settled against the fiscal year 2022 transaction and the portion that isn't yet settled in 2023.

    - **Portion of the opening balance that's settled against the previous year:** The first amount is $700, based on the totals that were found that are settled across 2022 and 2023.
    - **Portion of the opening balance that isn't settled against the previous year:** The second amount is the difference between the opening balance and the first amount of $525. The remaining amount is $1700 â€“ $700 = $1000.

    In this way, you can settle the 2023 transactions against the $700 that was originally settled against the 2022 transaction. This step is required because ledger settlement doesn't allow for partial settlement.

    1. Go to the general journal, and post the adjustment. Your organization will have to decide what transaction date to use, based on the periods that are open in 2023.
    2. You might have to temporarily turn off the **Do not allow manual entry** parameter on the **Main account** page. This adjustment won't be posted if the main account doesn't allow for manual entry.

8. You can now resettle the unsettled transactions. Return to the **Ledger settlement** page, and limit the date range to January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022. The following illustration shows the unsettled transactions that now exist.

    ![Unsettled transactions.](./media/afterYEC6.png)

    - The opening balance of $1,700 can be settled against the adjustment for -$1,700.
    - The detailed transactions that were unsettled for -$700 can be settled against the adjustment for $700.00.

9. Re-enable the **Awareness** feature.
10. After the **Awareness** feature is enabled, ledger settlement can't be done across fiscal years. You might have to further divide the remaining balance of $1,000 into smaller amounts before you can settle against new transactions in 2023. Some customers choose to post that detail during step 8, where the $1,000 is further divided to represent the unsettled transactions from 2022. This approach essentially mimics what the **Awareness** feature does for only the current year. Next year, it will automatically be done by using the **Keep details** setting in the ledger settlement setup.
