# Forecast position distribution 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

 
You can maintain distribution templates for forecast positions by using the controls on the **Financial dimensions** FastTab of the **Forecast position** page. The grid in the upper part of the FastTab shows all the distribution lines together with their percentage. The lower part of the FastTab shows the forecast position's default dimensions.

You can validate whether the dimensions for a forecast position are correct for your organization's chart of accounts. For any forecast position, on the **Forecast position** page, select **Validate** on the Action Pane to determine whether the setup of financial dimensions for that forecast position is valid. The validation is done against the account structure that you define on the **Configure account structures** page. This validation is quick and can help you identify errors before you generate a budget plan from a forecast position. You can also validate many forecast positions at the same time on the **Forecast positions** list page.

You can see when a forecast position was last validated on the **Forecast position validation** section on the **Budget planning** FastTab of the **Forecast position** page. The validation fields are also included on the **Forecast positions** list page.

For more information, see, [Position forecasting](../budgeting/position-forecasting.md).
