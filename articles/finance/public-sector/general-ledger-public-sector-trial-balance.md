# Trial balance with transactional detail report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the default report for trial balances. It also describes the building blocks that are associated with this report and how you can modify the report to fit your business requirements.

You can use the **Trial balance with transactional detail** report to show the details of each transaction for ledger accounts. The report includes the following information: 

- Opening balances
- Debits and credits 
- The resulting balances for a date range of 31 days or less

For transactions, the report includes the following information: 

- Transaction date
- Voucher number
- Account number
- Document number
- Ledger dimension
- Ledger dimension name
- Transaction description
- Debits or credits
- A running balance for the year to date, based on the current fiscal year

You can use the trial balance to identify errors for account balances. All accounts that have debit balances should equal all accounts that have credit balances. The report includes information from the general journal accounting entries.

You can filter the data by any of the following items:

- Posted transactions
- Pending transactions (These transactions include all transactions that aren't posted.) 
- All transactions 

If the transactions include financial dimensions, the report shows that information under a ledger account. Otherwise, information for financial dimensions is grouped at the top of the page. 

Currently, the report is exported directly to Microsoft Excel. 

## Transaction information on the report

Depending on the type of transaction, such as an advanced ledger entry (ALE) or purchase order, the following additional information appears on the report.
