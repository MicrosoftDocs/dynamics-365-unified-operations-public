# Forecast position reports for the public sector

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use the **Forecast position summary** and **Forecast position detail** reports to generate information about forecast positions during a budget plan and scenario that you specify.  

The **Forecast position summary** report shows forecast position costs by account distributions. The forecast position costs are shown, grouped by their assigned account distributions. The cost amounts are factored by the percentage assigned to the account distribution. 

The **Forecast position details** report contains most of the information displayed on the forecast position form. The account distributions assigned to the forecast position via financial dimensions and financial dimension templates are shown, along with the costs associated with each distribution combination for the forecast position. 

To view more information about a Forecast position, select the Position number to open the Forecast position page.
