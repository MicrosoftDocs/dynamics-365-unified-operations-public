[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Fund types must be created before you set up funds. Each fund must have a name and a unique number, and must be assigned a fund type and fund class. This procedure was created using the PSUS demo company data in the public sector partition.

1. Go to **General ledger > Chart of accounts > Funds > Funds**.
2. Click **New**.
3. In the **Fund number** field, type a value.
4. In the **Fund name** field, type a value.
5. In the **Fund type** field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.
6. In the list, select the fund type for this fund.
7. In the **Fund class** field, select an option.
8. Set the **Non-reporting fund** option to **Yes** or **No**.
9. Set the **Major fund** option to **Yes** or **No**.
10. Set the **Override selected year-end** option to **Yes** or **No**.
11. If you set the **Override selected year-end** option to **Yes**, select a year-end option.
12. Click **Save**.
