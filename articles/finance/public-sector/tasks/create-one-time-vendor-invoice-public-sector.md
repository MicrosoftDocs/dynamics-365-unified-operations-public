# Create a one-time vendor and invoice in the public sector

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The vendor record uses values from the default one-time vendor account. To view the account details, go to the **All vendors** page, and then double-click the **Vendor account number** of the default one-time vendor. You can create and assign to vendors any types of certification that they may hold. This task guide was created using the PSUS demo company data in the public sector partition.

1. Go to **Accounts payable > Invoices > Open vendor invoices**.
2. Click **New**.
3. Click **One-time vendor and invoice**.
4. In the **Type** field, select an option.
    * Fill out the other fields as necessary.  
5. Click **Create**.
    * The **Vendor invoice** page opens, displaying the vendor information.
