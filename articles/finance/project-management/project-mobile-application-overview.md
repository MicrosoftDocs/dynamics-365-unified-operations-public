# Project mobile applications overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Three mobile applications that are related to project time are available for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Timesheet, Project Time Entry, and My timesheets/Timesheets for my review (Optimized for mobile).

## Project Timesheet mobile app

The Dynamics 365 Project Timesheet mobile app lets users submit and approve timesheets for projects on their mobile device. This mobile app surfaces the timesheet functionality in the Project management and accounting area of Dynamics 365 Finance. It helps improve user productivity and efficiency, and also helps with the timely entry and approval of project timesheets.

## Project Time Entry workspace

The Project Time Entry workspace lets users enter and save time against a project. However, it doesn't let users submit or approve project timesheets. It can be used only for time entry. This mobile workspace is intended to be used together with the Finance and Operations mobile application.

## My timesheets/Timesheets for my review

My timesheets (Optimized for mobile) and Timesheets for my review (Optimized for mobile) make up a solution that lets employees create, submit, and approve project timesheets on a mobile device. Workers can access the Finance functionality through the URL for the application. This solution doesn't require the Finance and Operations mobile application.
