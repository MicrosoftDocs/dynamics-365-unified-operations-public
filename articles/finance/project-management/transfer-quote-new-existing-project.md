When a project quotation has a status of **Confirmed**, you can transfer some or all the quotation lines to a new or existing project by using the **Transfer to project** wizard. 

To use the wizard, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Quotations** > **Project quotations**.
2. Select the quotation you want to transfer and on the **Follow up** tab, in the **Modify** group, select **Transfer to project**.
3. Follow the **Transfer quotation to project** wizard to associate and transfer the quotation with a project.
