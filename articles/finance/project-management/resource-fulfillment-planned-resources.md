# Resource fulfillment for planned resources

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A project manager can plan required resource roles for a project. The resource manager will see these planned resources as requests on the **Resource fulfillment** page and can assign actual resources.

1. On the **All projects** page, select the **XYZ Upgrade Phase 2** project.
2. Select **Project**, and then select **Edit**.
3. On the **Project team and scheduling** tab, select **Add**.
4. In the **Add roles** dialog box, select the **Software developer** role.
5. Select **Create**, and then close the project page.
6. On the **Resource fulfillment** page, select **Software developer 1** for the **XYZ Upgrade project Phase 2** project.
7. Select a worker, and then select **Assign**.
8. Verify that the line for **Software developer 1** has been removed for the **XYZ Upgrade project Phase 2** project.
9. On the **Project team and scheduling** tab, for the **XYZ Upgrade Phase 2** project, verify that the worker that you selected in the previous step has been added as **Software developer**.
