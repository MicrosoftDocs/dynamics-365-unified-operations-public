# Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards inquiry

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, agencies that receive federal funds are subject to audit requirements, which are also known as single audits. The audit process is used to report on the revenues and expenditures of federal grants on a recurring basis. Part of the single audit report includes the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA).

The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards inquiry includes the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) title and number, the grant number, the year of the grant, the name of the federal agency that provides the funds, and the name of the pass-through entity. The inquiry is for a specific period. Typically, that period is the same as the financial statement period, which is a fiscal year.

The inquiry includes grants that have projection dates in the selected date range. The **Grantor agency** column of the inquiry shows the grant customer or, for a pass-through grant, the grantor agency. For a pass-through grant, the **Pass-through agency** column shows the grant customer. If the grant isn't a pass-through grant, the **Pass-through agency** column is blank.

## Set up the CFDA clusters

You must set up the CFDA clusters that can be associated with CFDA numbers in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards inquiry.

1. Go to **Project management and accounting \> Setup \> Grants \> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance clusters**.
2. Select **New** to create a CFDA cluster.
3. Enter the cluster name.
4. Select **Save** to save your changes.

## Set up CFDA numbers

You must set up CFDA numbers that can be added to grants and included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards inquiry.

1. Go to **Project management and accounting \> Setup \> Grants \> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers**.
2. Select **New** to create a CFDA number.
3. In the **Number** column, enter the CFDA number.
4. Press the **Tab** key.
5. In the **Description** column, enter the CFDA title.
6. Press the **Tab** key.
7. Optional: In the **Program cluster** field, add the appropriate CFDA cluster.
8. Select **Save** to save your changes.

## Set up grants to report for the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards inquiry

1. Go to **Project management and accounting \> Grants \> Grants**, and select an existing grant.
2. On the **Setup** FastTab, in the **Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance** field, assign the CFDA number. The CFDA number on the grant determines the CFDA cluster for reporting.
3. On **Contact information** FastTab, enter the grantor information by following these steps:

    1. In the **Grant customer** field, enter the customer who is responsible for the grant. For an existing grant, this information might already be entered.
    2. Indicate whether the grant customer is the funder. If the grant customer is the funder, leave the **Pass-through** check box cleared. If another customer is the funder, and the grant customer is responsible for spending and tracking the money, select the **Pass-through** check box.

4. If you selected the **Pass-through** check box in the previous step, in the **Grantor agency** field, enter the customer who provided the grant. The grantor agency and the grant customer can't be the same customer.

Here is an example of a pass-through grant:

The federal government funded an infrastructure project for a state. The federal government gave the money to the state to spend. In this case, the federal government is the grantor agency, and the state is the grant customer.

> [!NOTE] 
> When you first turn on the feature, initial CFDA numbers will be entered by using the existing numbers on grants.

## Exclude grants from SEFA reporting based on the grant type

1. Go to **Project management and accounting \> Setup \> Grants \> Grant types**.
2. On the **Default information** FastTab, select the **Exclude from Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards** check box.
3. Select **Save** to save your changes.
