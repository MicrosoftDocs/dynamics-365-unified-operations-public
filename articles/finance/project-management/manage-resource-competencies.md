# Manage resource competencies

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Resource competencies are an essential part of resource management. Competencies can be used as a baseline to determine resources that have the correct balance of skills, education, certification, and project experience. You should set up this information for each resource and update it on a regular basis. In this way, you can maximize capabilities when specific resource competencies are matched during project resource assignment.

The following procedures explain how to set up some of the competencies for a resource.

To set up competencies for a worker, you can use either the **Workers** list page in Human resources or the **Resources** list page in Project management and accounting. For the following procedures, the **Workers** list page in Human resources is used.

## Set up competencies: Certificates

1. On the **Workers** list page, select the line for the worker to add certificate information for.
2. On the Action Pane, on the **Worker** tab, in the **Competencies** group, select **Certificates**.
3. Select **New**, and then, in the **Certificate type** field, select **PMP**.
4. In the **Start date** field, select **10/1/2015**, and select **Save**.

## Set up competencies: Skills

1. On the **Workers** list page, make sure that the worker that you used in the previous procedure is still selected. Then, on the Action Pane, on the **Worker** tab, in the **Competencies** group, select **Skills**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Skill** field, select **Project management**.
4. In the **Level** field, select **5 Expert**.
5. In the **Level date** field, select **1-/14/2014**.
6. In the **Years of experience** field, enter **10**.
7. Select **Save**, and then close the page.
