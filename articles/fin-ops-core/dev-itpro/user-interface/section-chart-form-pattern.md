# Section Chart form pattern

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the Section Chart form pattern. This pattern is primarily used in conjunction with the Operational Workspace pattern, and specifically on forms that contain a chart control.

## Usage

The Section Chart form pattern is intended to be used primarily in conjunction with the Operational Workspace pattern. Specifically, the chart section or summary section contains Form Part Controls that point to forms that contain charts. These referenced forms are intended to use the Section Chart pattern.

## Pattern changes for finance and operations apps
This pattern didn't exist for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.
