# Person search report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Person search report is a refinement of the existing Data management framework of Finance and Operations apps. The Data management framework offers a pre-packaged set of entities that Microsoft authored to identify personal data that is used to define a person and the roles that a person might be assigned to in Finance and Operations applications. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the report with Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, and Human Resources. The report is not currently available for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. The Person search report is available in version 8.0. The report is also available in version 7.3 (delivered via monthly update 7.3.2), in version 7.2 (via KB 4132615), and in version 7.1 (via KB 4132441). The Person search report may be updated periodically. Before using this report, you need to ensure that you have obtained and applied all relevant hotfixes. 

You can use the Global address book to create an instance of a person that is described in the data model as a party. 

When you add a contact, customer, user, worker, or other person in Finance and Operations data, you typically start by creating an address book entry for that person. Each person in the address book is referred to as a party and is assigned a PartyID. The person also takes on a role in the system, such as customer, user, or worker, and has a role ID: CustID, UserID, WorkerID, and possibly others.

At times, you might want to verify that the information that is entered and used to describe or otherwise identify a person is correct. Situations might also arise where it's useful to share that information with the data subject who requested the data. The Person search report can help with both these tasks.

The Person search report is extensible. If you find that the existing entities do not contain all of the personal data you are looking for, they can be extended, or new entities can be written. In addition, you can change the data mappings for each entity and remove fields that you don't want to export.

The Person search report lets you specify different identifiers for a person, such as a CustomerID or VendorID. It will then collect, filter, and populate the entity collection set with personal data that is related only to the person you specified.

On rare occasions, a single person might be entered in your system more than once. The Person search report lets you specify each person instance to be included on a single report. For example, someone named Fred Smith might be both "Fred Smith" and "F. D. Smith" in your address book.

An individual might exist as multiple parties in data. You can provide multiple identifiers for each party type, and each party type's personal data will be included on a single report.
