# Respond to requests for personal data in AX 2012

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article can help businesses that use Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, implementation partners, and independent software vendors (ISVs) comply with requests from a data subject concerning their personal data under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For more information about the GDPR and the related resources that Microsoft provides, see the [General Data Protection Regulation overview](./gdpr-guide.md). Although the "Guide to the GDPR for finance and operations" was written for finance and operations apps, the rights that a data subject has under the GDPR apply to organizations using Dynamics AX 2012. The steps listed in the "Guide to the GDPR for finance and operations" can be used by an organization responding to a request for personal data and are also appropriate for organizations using Dynamics AX 2012, with the exception of the **Person search** report, which is not available for Dynamics AX 2012. This article lists additional points that are specific to Dynamics AX 2012. 

## Applicable product updates for Dynamics AX 2012

Additional product updates and information related to GDPR that's specific to AX 2012 are available from [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Results?q=3909273) (LCS). Sign-in is required for access to LCS. 

Here are some example inquiries and reports that are available in AX 2012 that might help you find and report personal data:

+ **Home** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Global address book**

    In the inquiry window, enter a person's name in the search box.

+ **Accounts payable** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Vendor** &gt; **All vendors**
+ **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Customer** &gt; **All Customers**
+ **Human resources** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Workers**
+ **Sales and marketing** &gt; **Common** > **Customers**, **Prospects**, **Leads**, or **Contacts**
