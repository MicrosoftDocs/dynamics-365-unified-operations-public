# Validate applications for finance and operations apps

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about the requirements that are used to verify that custom code meets Microsoft guidelines, and that a solution package can be successfully bundled and delivered in a finance and operations apps environment.

Microsoft requires specific reviews in order to validate the following requirements:

-   A partner's custom code meets Microsoft guidelines.
-   A Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) solution package can be successfully bundled and delivered.
-   Core independent software vendor (ISV) business scenarios can be transacted.

Currently, partners must demonstrate that these requirements have been met by doing test deployments and then sharing the results with Microsoft. No code will be deployed on a customer environment that Microsoft hasn't validated. Partners must complete the following curation artifacts and tests:

-   Code analysis report (CAR)
-   Business process modeler (BPM)/test scripts
-   Business database backup
-   Project name and description
-   Data packages 
-   Methodology 
-   Binaries (optional)
-   Deployable packages
-   Models (code and tests)
-   Marketing content

## Curation meeting

The following table describes the steps that must be completed before the validation meeting.

|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CAR                          | All major issues that the CAR highlights should be addressed after you upgrade. The CAR must be submitted to Microsoft before the validation meeting.                                                                                                                                |
| BPM/test scripts             | All task recordings should be completed for the industry vertical that the solution package is designed for and should include end-to-end scenarios.                                                                                                                                 |
| Business database backup     | A business database of your upgraded environment and best practice configurations should be loaded into the Asset library in LCS.                                                                                                                        |
| Project name and description | The project name and description should be incorporated into the beginning of the implementation methodology for the solution package.                                                                                                                                               |
| Data packages                | All data packages should be loaded into LCS before the validation meeting. Create data entities for any additional custom fields or tables for your custom functional features. You should be able to modify the data packages and load them into an empty environment, and then consume the data packages in Data Management Framework. |
| Methodology                  | The methodology should incorporate an overview of the product. A guided experience to Conference Room Pilot 1 (CRP1) and any other implementation methodology that is specifically tailored to your solution are optional. |
| Binaries (optional)          | Incorporate any required binary files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Deployable packages          | Incorporate the deployable packages that are required in order to bring your custom features and functionality into your environment.                                                                                                                                     |
| Models (code and tests)      | Incorporate any model files that are required for your solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Marketing content            | Add your marketing content, such as logos, descriptions, and screen shots of your solution package. The solution logo should be app-specific and should not include your company name. The description should be aligned with your custom business processes.                            |


## Update and maintenance requirements
If you have a curated solution that is published on AppSource, you must keep the solution up to date. After each major Spring and Fall release, you will have eight weeks to upgrade your code. You must update and test the following artifacts:

-   CAR
-   Models (code and tests)
-   Deployable packages
-   BPM/test scripts
-   Data packages
-   Business database backup

### Maintenance process steps

| Phase | Number | Activity                                       | Process steps                                                                | Success criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------|--------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 1      | Validate customer code. | Run all customer model files by using the CAR tool, and generate the report. | Successfully create a CAR without any localization, accessibility, performance, or security issues. All major issues that the CAR highlights should be addressed after you've upgraded to the latest major release. The CAR must be submitted to Microsoft within eight weeks after each major Spring and Fall release. |
