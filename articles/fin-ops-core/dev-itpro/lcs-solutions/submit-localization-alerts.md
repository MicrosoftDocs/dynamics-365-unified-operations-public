# Submit alerts about country/region-specific regulatory features

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to submit alerts through the  Dynamics regulatory alert submission service. This topic also explains how to track planned and released regulatory features through LCS Issue search. 

Accessing the regulatory alert submission service
-------------------------------------------------

In Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), in your project, scroll to the right side of the page, and then, under **More tools**, click the **Alert service** tile. 

The **Dynamics regulatory alert submission** page appears. You can use this page to view any alerts that have previously been submitted by you or your organization.

## Submitting a regulatory alert
To enter a new regulatory alert, click the plus sign (**+**) at the top of the **Dynamics regulatory alert submission** page, above the filter. The **Alert submission** wizard starts. You can complete the following tasks in this wizard:

- Search for existing regulatory items.
- Attach business processes.
- Describe an alert.
- Confirm submissions.

### Search for existing regulatory items

Use Issue search to identify whether a regulatory feature, that is related to the alert, already exists.

1.  Enter a search term, such as a keyword, country/region, Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) number, or Application Object Tree (AOT) object. Click the search button. Any items that include the search term, in either product issues or regulatory features, appear in the search results. You can narrow the search by using the filters that are available.
2.  If you don't find the regulatory feature that you're looking for, you can submit a regulatory alert by clicking **Submit regulatory alert** at the bottom of the browser window. 

### Attach business processes

1.  In the **Global business process libraries** list, select business process libraries.
2.  Enter search criteria to find business processes that are related to the search term. These business processes are highlighted in yellow.
3.  In the list on the right side of the page, select one or more related business processes, and drag them into the field on the left . After you've finished, you can edit them further by clearing the selection of business processes.
4.  Add the selected business processes to the alert. 

### Describe the alert

1. Enter information about the alert in the appropriate fields. Required fields are indicated by a red asterisk. The following table provides more information about the fields on the **Describe the alert** page.

    <table >
            <tr>

2.  After you've finished entering all the information, select the consent check box (**By submitting this regulatory alert, I consent to Microsoft contacting me for additional information about this alert. Microsoft Privacy Statement.**). When you select the check box, the **Submit** button becomes available.
3.  Click **Submit** to save and submit the alert.

If you don't have all of the required information, or if you're not yet ready to submit the alert, you can save a partially completed alert.

### Confirm your submission

-   When the alert is successfully submitted, you receive a confirmation message. Click **Done** to exit the wizard.
-   If you save the alert before you submit it, an alert ID is generated, and you receive confirmation that the alert has been saved.

## Track the status of regulatory features in Issue search
You can use Issue search in LCS to find planned and released regulatory features, and any associated localization documentation, certifications, and reports. To narrow your search to regulatory features, use the following filters:

-   **Category** - Select **Regulatory feature** only.
-   **Country/region** - Click **&gt;** to select the country/region that you're interested in.

To narrow the search even more, you can apply the following additional filters

-   **Product** - Select the products and product versions that you're interested in.
-   **Status** - Select specific statuses.
