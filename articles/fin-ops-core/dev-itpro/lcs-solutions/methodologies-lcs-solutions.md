# Add methodologies to solutions

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to create and modify methodologies in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). It also provides information about the requirements for methodologies.

## Methodology requirements

The first two phases of your methodology are the Learn and Consume phases from the LCS Solutions Consumption methodology. 

During the Learn phase, your product description must be aligned with your business process library, the descriptions or summaries in your marketing material, and the functionality that is supported in the current version of your solution. The Learn phase includes the following tasks:

-   **Product description** – Take advantage of your marketing description by adding it to the LCS methodology.
-   **Get an overview** – Include content for your solution, such as information about the features and architecture.
-   **How to get help** – Include numbers, contacts, or direct links to your company's website, for people who help build and maintain the solution.

The Consume phase is **optional**. It includes tasks that are required in order to complete Conference room pilot 1 (CRP1). 


After the Learn and Consume phases, you can add any other steps that are required in order to implement your solution. You can either modify the phases and tasks so that they are aligned with your solution, or use your company's implementation methodology.

## Create a new methodology
1.  On the LCS home page, select the **Manage methodologies** tile.
2.  Select the **New methodology** button (the plus sign [**+**]).
3.  Set values for the fields, and then select **Confirm**.
4.  Create phases and tasks.
5.  Add any linked tools and resources that are required.

## Edit a methodology
1.  On the LCS home page, select the **Manage methodologies** tile.
2.  Select the methodology to edit.
3.  Select the **Edit methodology** button (the pencil symbol), and edit the methodology.

## Edit a project's methodology
Follow these steps to edit a methodology in a specific project only.

1.  On the project's home page, select the ellipsis (**...**) button above the project phases, and then select **Edit methodology**.
2.  Edit the phases and tasks.
3.  Edit the linked tools and resources, if any changes are required.

## Change a project’s methodology
1.  On the project's home page, click the ellipsis (**...**) button above the project phases, and then click **Change methodology**.
2.  In the dialog box that appears, set the **Do you want to keep the existing phases and tasks?** option. If you set this option to **Yes**, the phases and tasks from the methodology that you select in step 3 are added to the end of the current methodology. If you set the option to **No**, the current methodology is replaced with the methodology that you select in step 3.
3.  Select a methodology to use with your project.
4.  Select **Confirm**.
