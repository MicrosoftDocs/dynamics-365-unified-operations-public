# Globalization resources

## Local and regional deployments
If your government regulations require data to be stored differently or serviced differently than is required for other countries/regions, there might be country/region requirements you must consider during deployment. Consider the following resources that might be relevant to you:

[Finance and Operations apps operated by 21Vianet in China](../deployment/china-local-deployment.md)

## Localization and regulatory features

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Finance and Operations apps include functionality for the country/regions documented in the [Product localization and translation availability guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck). This functionality is enabled based on the primary address of the active legal entity. 

This topic includes lists of resources that can help you do the following: 
- Learn more about developing country/region-specific solutions.
- Get country/region specific updates.
- Submit and review regulatory alerts.
- Learn how to use country/region specific functionality.

-   [Apply country/region context](apply-country-context.md)
-   [Regulatory certification information in feature titles](regulatory-certifications.md)
