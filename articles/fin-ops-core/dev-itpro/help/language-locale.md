# Language and locale descriptors in Help

The client that finance and operations apps use supports multiple languages and locales. To add custom Help content for one or more locales to the in-product **Help** pane, you must make sure that both the following conditions are met:

- The value of the **ms.locale** property in each HTML file matches the locale of the content.

    For example, the German (Germany) content must have a setting of **ms.locale: de-de**.

- On the custom Help website, the content is in a folder has the same name as the locale.

    For example, the German (Germany) content must be in a folder that is named **de-de**.

For more information, see [Custom Help overview](custom-help-overview.md) and [Deploy custom Help to Azure](walkthrough-help-azure.md).
