# Language and locale descriptors in the product and in Help

The client that Finance and Operations apps use supports multiple languages and locales. To add custom Help content for one or more locales to the in-product **Help** pane, you must make sure that both the following conditions are met:

- The value of the **ms.locale** property in each HTML file matches the locale of the content.

    For example, the German (Germany) content must have a setting of **ms.locale: de-de**.

- On the custom Help website, the content is in a folder has the same name as the locale.

    For example, the German (Germany) content must be in a folder that is named **de-de**.

For more information, see [Custom Help overview](custom-help-overview.md) and [Deploy custom Help to Azure](walkthrough-help-azure.md).

## Languages and descriptors

## Languages, translations, and adaptations

Microsoft teams create content in English (United States). That content is then translated into several languages, and the translated content is made available in a public GitHub repo for each language.

To maximize reuse of translations, translation services treat some languages as variants of another language. For example, German for Austria and German for Germany are considered so closely related that they are treated as variants of each other. Therefore, you can use the files in the Dynamics-365-Operations.de-de GitHub repo as a starting point for both German (Germany) content and German (Austria) content.

When you extend the in-product **Help** pane, you must assign indexes for the relevant locales. For more information, see [Customize language fallback](connect-help-pane.md#customize-language-fallback).
