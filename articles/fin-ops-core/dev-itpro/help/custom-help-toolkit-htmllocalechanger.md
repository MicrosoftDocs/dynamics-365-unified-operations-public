# The HtmlLocaleChanger tool

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The **HtmlLocaleChanger** tool can process HTML files that are generated by a third-party tool.

## <a name="htmllocale"></a>Use the HtmlLocaleChanger tool to align locales

The **HtmlLocaleChanger** tool can update your HTML files by setting a new value for the **ms.locale** property. For example, you have HTML files for German (Germany), and you want to make the same content available in German (Austria). In this case, you can run the tool to change the setting from **ms.locale: de-de** to **ms.locale:de-at**.

Here's the syntax for running HtmlLocaleChanger.exe.

```
HtmlLocaleChanger.exe --h <path> --l <locale> --v <true|false>
```

The following table explains the parameters.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| h | Specify the path of the HTML files to process. |
| l | Specify the new locale for the HTML files. |
| v | Set this parameter to **true** to turn on verbose logging. Otherwise, set it to **false**. |

## Example

The following example changes the locale to **de-at** and turns on verbose logging.

```
HtmlLocaleChanger.exe --h D:\D365-Operations\d365F-O\supply-chain\de --l de-at --v
```
