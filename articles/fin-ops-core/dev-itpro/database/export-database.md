# Export a database

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to export a database from a sandbox user acceptance testing (UAT) environment to the Asset library.

## Self-service export database

[!include [dbmovement-export](../includes/dbmovement-export.md)]

### Export operation failure

Most often, export operations fail because the process in LCS times out while it's waiting for a response from Microsoft Azure SQL Database. You can use the **Resume** button to reconnect LCS to the ongoing export process and see it through to completion. If more than 24 hours have passed since you began the export, the pending asset in the LCS Project asset library will be expired. In this case, you must roll back the export operation and restart it.

To cancel an export operation that has failed, you can use the **Rollback** button.

### Data elements that aren't exported

When you export a database backup from an environment, some elements of the database aren't exported in the backup file. Here are some examples:

* Email addresses in the LogisticsElectronicAddress table.
* Batch job history in the BatchJobHistory, BatchHistory, and BatchConstraintHistory tables.
* SMTP Relay server in the SysEmailParameters table.
* Print Management settings in the PrintMgmtSettings and PrintMgmtDocInstance tables.
* Environment-specific records in the SysServerConfig, SysServerSessions, SysCorpNetPrinters, SysClientSessions, BatchServerConfig, and BatchServerGroup tables.
* Document attachments in the DocuValue table. These attachments include any Microsoft Office templates that were overwritten in the source environment.
* All users except the admin will be set to **Disabled** status.
* All batch jobs are set to **Withhold** status.
* All users will have their partition value reset to the "initial" partition record ID.
* All Microsoft-encrypted fields will be cleared, because they can't be decrypted on a different database server. An example is the **Password** field in the SysEmailSMTPPassword table.

### Known issues

#### Export ran for some time and then reached a "Preparation failed" state

The export process can time out on Azure SQL Database when large databases are involved. In some cases, the export process can be recovered by using the **Resume** action from LCS. The Lifecycle Services team is working to identify known error codes, so these can be added to the logs for the export database operation to help guide users toward a resolution. These known error codes will be added in a future release of LCS. If you encounter an issue, you can manually export by following the “Manual export” section below.

#### Export doesn't show any progress in LCS

The export process differs from other database movement operations, and the general package deployment doesn't use a runbook. Therefore, the progress indicator in LCS doesn't show any output, even though it typically shows output in other scenarios. The LCS team is working to identify known error codes so that they can be added to the logs for the export database operation to help guide users toward a resolution. These known error codes will be added in a future release of LCS.
