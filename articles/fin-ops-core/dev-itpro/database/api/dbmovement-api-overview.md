The Database Movement application programming interface (API) is a RESTful endpoint that is used to manage the data lifecycle of Microsoft Dynamics 365 environments. It provides a versioned set of capabilities that you can currently use to copy databases between environments, and to list and download database backups. More supported actions will be added in later releases.

## What is supported by the Database Movement API?

The Database Movement API exposes RESTful endpoints for the following Dynamics 365 services:

* Dynamics 365 Finance
* Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management
* Dynamics 365 Commerce
