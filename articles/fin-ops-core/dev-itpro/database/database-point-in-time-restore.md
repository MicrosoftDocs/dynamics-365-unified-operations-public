# Database point-in-time restore (PITR)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to perform the point-in-time restore (PITR) for a sandbox user acceptance testing (UAT) environment. Microsoft maintains [automated backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups) according to Microsoft Azure SQL defaults, up to a maximum of 30 days.

## Self-service point-in-time restore

### Restore operation failed
In the event of failure, the option to do a **rollback** is available. If you select the rollback option after the operation originally fails, your target sandbox environment is restored to the state that it was in before the restore began. A rollback is often required if a customization that is present in the target sandbox environment can't complete a database synchronization with the newly restored data.

To determine the root cause of the failure, download the runbook logs using the available buttons before starting the rollback operation.

### Data elements that need attention after restore
When you restore a database from a previous point in time, keep in mind that the database is provided "as was." For example, batch jobs and other data elements in the system can be in an in-progress state. These elements will require manual review.

### Environment administrator
The system administrator account in the target environment (that is, the account that has a **UserId** value of **Admin**) is reset to the value that is found in the web.config file in the target environment. This value should match the value of the administrator account in LCS. To preview which account will be used, go to the **Environment Details** page for your target sandbox environment in LCS. The value that was selected in the **Environment Administrator** field when the environment was first deployed is updated to the system administrator in the transactional database. The tenant of the environment will be the tenant of the environment administrator.

If you've used the Admin User Provisioning Tool in your environment to change the value in the web.config file, the value might not match the value in LCS. If you require a different account, you must deallocate and delete the target sandbox environment, and then redeploy it by selecting another account. You can then do another refresh database action to restore the data.

## Known issues

### Breaking the chain of available restore points
Several frequently used actions create a new database that won't have the same restore point history as the previously used database. These actions include point-in-time restores, database refreshes, database imports, and point-in-time restores from the production environment to the sandbox environment. In addition, if a software deployable package that you apply to your environment fails during update of the database, and you use the rollback functionality in LCS, the rollback functionality does a point-in-time restore of the database, and that restore also creates a new database. 

Although the new database doesn't have any restore point history, it does begin to accrue new restore points from that time onward. After you perform any of the previously mentioned actions, you can't perform it again by using the same restore date and time.

### Restore is denied for environments that run Platform update 20 or earlier
The restore database process cannot be completed if the environment is running Platform update 3 or earlier. For more information, see the [list of currently supported Platform updates](..//migration-upgrade/versions-update-policy.md).
