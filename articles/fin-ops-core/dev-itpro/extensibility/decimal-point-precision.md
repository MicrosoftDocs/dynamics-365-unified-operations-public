# Extending number of decimals for selected data types

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to extend the number of decimals for selected data types. You can create extensions of specific extended data types of the type Real, to change the number of decimals for certain scenarios. To change the number of decimals, change the **NoOfDecimals** property as needed.

Extended data types are hierarchical and inherit behavior from the data type they extend. When changing the number of decimals for one extended data type, the number of decimals on all derived extended data types will follow. In other words, if you find an extended data type where **NoOfDecimalsIsExtensible** is false, then check the parent extended data type, as the number of decimals might be extensible in this wider scope.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to database constraints, each of the data types described in this article can have a maximum precision of six decimals.

## Weight

Weight data can be maintained with a maximum of two decimals by default.

If you require the ability to enter, maintain, and view weight data with a maximum of six decimals, you must extend the number of decimals for the **WeightBase** extended data type.

## Product width, height and depth

These physical dimensions can be maintained with a maximum of two decimals by default.

If you require the ability to enter, maintain, and view this data with a maximum of six decimals, you must extend the number of decimals for the **InventWidth**, **InventHeight**, and **InventDepth** extended data types respectively.

## Product quantity

Quantity data that is related to the procuring, consuming, producing, storing, and selling of products can be maintained with a maximum of two decimals by default.

If you require the ability to enter, maintain, and view product quantities with a maximum of six decimals, you must extend the number of decimals of the **ProductQuantity**, **CostQuantity**, and **CAMMagnitude** extended data types.

Bill of materials, formulas, and production orders allow maintaining quantities with four decimals by default.

If you require more than four decimals, extend the number of decimals for the **BOMProductQuantity** extended data type.

### Related data types

**Price unit**, **Price quantity**, and **Charge quantity data** can be extended independently from product quantities.

You can extend the **PriceUnit** extended data type to change the number of decimals to a value other than the default two for price units.

You can extend the **PriceQty** extended data type to change the number of decimals to a value other than the default two for price and charge quantities.

### Overloaded data types

There are two extended data types that are used for storing both quantity data and other types of data. These data types must be extended separately.

The **AmountQty** extended data type is used for storing and presenting both amounts and quantities. The **AmountQty** extended data type should be extended to the maximum required number of decimals for both amounts and quantities.

For example, if amounts need to be maintained with three decimals, but quantities still need to be maintained with two decimals, then the data type should be extended to three decimals.

The **ProductQuantityHourValue** extended data type is used for storing and presenting both hours and quantities. The **ProductQuantityHourValue** extended data type should be extended to the maximum required number of decimals for both hours and quantities.

For example, if quantities need to be maintained with four decimals, but hours still need to be maintained with two decimals, then the data type should be extended to four decimals.

## Unit amounts

By default, unit amounts including prices, line discount amounts, and line charge amounts can be maintained with a maximum of two decimals.

If you require the ability enter, maintain, and view unit amounts with a maximum of six decimals, you must extend the number of decimals of the **UnitAmountCur**, **UnitAmountMST**, and **CostPriceNonMonetary** extended data types.

If you require a more than four number of decimals, you should also extend the PriceRoundOff extended data type.

### Overloaded data types

There are five extended data types that are used for storing both unit amount data and other types of data.

The **PriceDiscAmount** extended data type is used for storing and presenting amounts and unit amounts. The **PriceDiscAmount** extended data type should be extended to the maximum required number of decimals for both amounts and unit amounts.

For example, if amounts need to be maintained with three decimals, but unit amounts need to be maintained with four decimals, the data type should be extended to four decimals.

The **MCRRoyaltyValue**, **PdsRebateValue**, **TAMRebateValue**, and **MarkupValue** extended data types are used for storing and presenting amounts, unit amounts, and percentages.

The extended data types should be extended to the maximum required number of decimals for amounts, unit amounts, and percentages. For example, if amounts need to be maintained with three decimals, but unit amounts need to be maintained with four decimals and percentages should remain maintained with two decimals, then the data type should be extended to four number of decimals.

## Amounts

Amounts, including unit amounts, can be maintained with a maximum of two decimals by default.

If you require the ability to enter, maintain, and view amounts including unit amounts with a of maximum six decimals, you must extend the number decimals of the **Amount**, **AmountMST**, and **CostAmountNonMonetary** extended data types.

If you require a different number of decimals for unit amounts other than for amount, follow the description for how to extend the number of decimals for unit amounts.

### Overloaded data types

There are three extended data types that are used for storing amount data and other types of data. This means that they must be extended separately.

The **AmountQty** extended data type is used for storing and presenting amounts and quantities. The **AmountQty** extended data type should be extended to the maximum required number of decimals for both amounts and quantities.

For example, if amounts need to be maintained with three decimals, but quantities still need to be maintained with two, then the data type should be extended to three decimals.

The **PriceDiscAmount** extended data type is used for storing and presenting amounts and unit amounts. The **PriceDiscAmount** extended data type should be extended to the maximum required number of decimals for amounts and unit amounts.

For example, if amounts need to be maintained with three decimals, but unit amounts need to be maintained with four decimals, then the data type should be extended to four decimals.

The **MarkupValue** extended data type is used for storing and presenting amounts, unit amounts, and percentages.

The extended data types should be extended to the maximum required number of decimals for amounts, unit amounts, and percentages.

For example, if amounts need to be maintained with three decimals, unit amounts need to be maintained with four decimals, and percentages should remain with two decimals, then the data type should be extended to four decimals.
