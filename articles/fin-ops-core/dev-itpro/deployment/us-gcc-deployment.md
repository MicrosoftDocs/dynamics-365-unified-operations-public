# Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, and Commerce in US Government Community Cloud (GCC)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]



Select Microsoft Dynamics 365 United States (US) Government products are available to qualified government and private entities. Those entities are limited to the following types:

- US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government entities
- Private entities that use Dynamics 365 US Government to provide solutions to government entities or to qualified members of the cloud community
- Private entities that have customer data that is subject to government regulations, and Dynamics 365 US Government is the appropriate service to meet the regulatory requirements

For information, see [Dynamics 365 US Government](/power-platform/admin/microsoft-dynamics-365-government).

## Onboarding

To complete the initial onboarding for an implementation project in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), follow the instructions in [Onboard an implementation project](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/onboard.md). However, don't use the link to public LCS that is provided in those instructions. Instead, use the following URL to open LCS for US Government Community Cloud (GCC): <https://gov.lcs.microsoftdynamics.us>.

After the initial onboarding is completed, follow the instructions in [Project onboarding](../lifecycle-services/project-onboarding.md). Once again, use [LCS for GCC](https://gov.lcs.microsoftdynamics.us) instead of public LCS.

## Environment deployment

After you've completed project onboarding, you can review the additional capabilities of LCS that are described in [Lifecycle Services (LCS) for Finance and Operations apps customers](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs.md). Then move on to environment deployment.

- To deploy Microsoft-managed environments via LCS, follow the instructions in [Lifecycle Services (LCS) for Finance and Operations apps customers](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs.md#new-deployment-experience).
- For cloud-hosted environments, see [Deploy and access development environments](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/access-instances.md). You must also complete the Resource Manager onboarding process for your connectors, as described in [Complete the Azure Resource Manager onboarding process for US government Lifecycle Services projects](arm-onbarding-us-goverment.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For US Government LCS projects, only Azure Governmentâ€“specific Azure subscriptions are supported.

## Features that aren't available

Some features won't be available for deployment in GCC, or they won't be available to use with Dynamics 365 in GCC. For example, Azure DevOps Services will be unavailable in GCC. However, on-premises Azure DevOps or public Azure DevOps services can be used. For detailed information about feature availability, see [Business Applications US Government Feature Availability](https://aka.ms/BAPFunctionalParity).

### Can I deploy a cloud-hosted environment Tier-1 development environment on an Azure commercial subscription?

### What can I do if I need a package from the Shared asset library, but it isn't available in LCS for GCC?

You can download the same package from the Shared asset library in [public LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com). Alternatively, your partner can help you download the package.

### Is the code upgrade tool available in GCC?

No, the code upgrade tool isn't currently available in GCC. However, you can create a prospect project in [public LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com) and use the code upgrade tool. Note that you won't be able to deploy environments in prospect projects.

### Can my partner open a support ticket on my behalf?

Yes. However, if your partner uses a non-GCC identity, the support ticket will be directed to the public support queue. We recommend that you use customer GCC entitlement in LCS to open support tickets.
