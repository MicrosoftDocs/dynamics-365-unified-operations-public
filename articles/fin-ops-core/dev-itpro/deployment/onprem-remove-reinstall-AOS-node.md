# Remove and reinstall an AOS node

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to remove an Application Object Server (AOS) node in your on-premises environment to reduce or replace a failed node. It also explains how to add a new node.

## Remove a node

### Option 1: Use a configuration file (preferred option)

**Reference document:** [Add or remove nodes to a standalone Service Fabric cluster running on Windows Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-windows-server-add-remove-nodes)

1. In Service Fabric Explorer, select **Cluster**, and make a note of the Microsoft Service Fabric cluster version. For this example, the cluster version is **6.5.676.9590**.

    ![Cluster version](media/fe0c857aefd3a1174df38f8e0c644667.png)

2. On one of the orchestrator nodes, open File Explorer. On the **View** tab, in the **Show/hide** group, make sure that the **File name extensions** and **Hidden items** check boxes are selected.

    ![View options](media/bb83d249cdce333bdbb2e276ebce559c.png)

3. Expand drive C, and then drill down into the following folder. (Note that the bold parts of the path will vary, depending on the node name and setup.)

    C:\\ProgramData\\SF\\**ORCH1**\\Fabric\\work\\Applications\\\_\_FabricSystem\\**_App4294967295**\\work\\Store\\**131811633624852852**

    In the folder, you should see a list of folders for various versions of Microsoft Service Fabric. Here is an example.

    ![Contents of the 131811633624852852 folder](media/f843b5ceda67f767f54333851f5deeec.png)

5. Open the folder with the name the same as the version of Microsoft Service Fabric cluster you that you made a note of earlier. For this example, the folder is named **6.5.676.9590**.
6. In the folder, you should see a .cab file.

    ![Contents of the 6.5.676.9590 folder](media/fd04e00bc3d940f5637900e46db8f134.png)

7. Copy the .cab file to C:\\Temp, and rename the copied file **MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric.cab**. (If you don't have a Temp folder, create it.)

    ![Copied and renamed file in the Temp folder](media/e146a300f030d0695be858d8c7261486.png)

8. Open a Windows PowerShell Command Prompt window as an admin.
9. Run the following command to connect to the Service Fabric cluster.

    ```powershell
    #Connect to Service Fabric Cluster. Replace 123 with server/star thumbprint and use appropriate IP address
    Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -connectionEndpoint 10.0.0.12:19000 -X509Credential -FindType FindByThumbprint -FindValue 123 -ServerCertThumbprint 123
    ```

    ![Connect command and result](media/0af2777b388b786d2ba6fe0b1f0f77dc.png)

10. Run the following command to save the configuration file to C:\\Temp\\ClusterConfig.json. (Make sure that the C:\\Temp path exists.)

    ```powershell
    Get-ServiceFabricClusterConfiguration -UseApiVersion -ApiVersion 10-2017 >C:\Temp\ClusterConfig.json
    ```

11. In the configuration file that you saved in the previous step, in the **fabricSettings** section, in the **Setup** section, add a section for the **NodesToBeRemoved** parameter. The parameter value should be a comma-separated list of names of the nodes that must be removed. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Be sure to add a comma to the end of the line that precedes the new section.

    ```json
    "fabricSettings": [
        {
            "name": "Setup",
            "parameters": [
                {
                    "name": "FabricDataRoot",
                    "value": "C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SF"
                },
                {
                    "name": "FabricLogRoot",
                    "value": "C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SF\\\\Log"
                },
                {
                    "name": "NodesToBeRemoved",
                    "value": "AOS1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```

12. Remove the node from the **Nodes** section. In the following example, the **AOS1** node was removed.

    ```json
    "Nodes": [
        {
            "NodeName": "AOS2",
            "NodeTypeRef": "AOSNodeType",
            "IPAddress": "10.0.0.10",
            "FaultDomain": "fd:/fd1",
            "UpgradeDomain": "ud1"
        },
        {
        "NodeName": "AOS3",
        "NodeTypeRef": "AOSNoâ€¦
    ```

13. Remove the following lines from the **Security** section.

    ```json
    "WindowsIdentities": {
        "\$id": "3"
    },
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't remove these lines, you will receive the following error message later:
    >
    > ValidationException: Authentication type can't be changed from unsecured to Windows.

14. Increment the version number of the configuration file. Make this change at the lowest increment. In the following example, the version number went from **1.0.0** to **1.0.1**.

    ```json
    "ClusterConfigurationVersion": "1.0.1"
    ```

15. Save the configuration file.
16. Run the following command to remove the node.

    ```powershell
    Start-ServiceFabricClusterConfigurationUpgrade -ClusterConfigPath C:\Temp\ClusterConfig.json
    ```

17. Run the following command to monitor the progress.

    ```powershell
    Get-ServiceFabricClusterUpgrade
    ```

    If the upgrade stops responding at "UpgradePhase: PreUpgradeSafetyCheck," make a note of the **NodeName** value, and restart that node from Service Fabric Explorer. In the following illustration, the upgrade has stopped responding. It was running for 50 minutes at the same status on node BI1.

    ![Upgrade that has stopped responding](media/c9a57cd8a5828a63a010d829eaab597c.png)

    During upgrade of the cluster configuration, if you receive an error message that states that you previously added a node through the **Add-ServiceFabricNode** command, you will need to run a configuration upgrade without making any changes to the configuration file except for the version number. You can use the **Get-ServiceFabricClusterConfiguration** and **Start-ServiceFabricClusterConfigurationUpgrade** commands for this purpose.

    ![Get command and result](media/329b9c2bd807d7bca96e106037504e0e.png)

    You can also view the progress in Service Fabric Explorer.

    ![Progress information in Service Fabric Explorer](media/99c6321f9da950d91a1709cae2473d97.png)

### Option 2: Use Service Fabric Explorer

1. Sign in to Service Fabric Explorer.
2. Select the **Settings** button (gear symbol), and make sure that **Advanced** mode is turned on.

    ![Advanced mode turned on](media/bc25caaed54da595a3c75429faaf73cb.png)

3. Expand **Nodes**, select the ellipsis (**...**) button next to the node that you want to remove, and then select **Deactivate (remove data)**. Note that this option might not be available if the node is already down (for example, if the node server can't be started).

    ![Deactivate (remove data) command](media/6865310acd6150cc81ee4a56aaeeed3f.png)

4. When you're prompted to confirm deactivation, enter the name of the node, and then select **Deactivate (remove data)**.

    ![Confirmation of node deactivation](media/49486a44d04b7a91431f18beebda43e8.png)

    After the node has been deactivated, its status is shown as **Disabled**.

    ![Node that has Disabled status](media/4dba61b4c22966cb4098cf832a4e5e90.png)

5. If the server is still active and connected to the domain, you might have to follow these steps if you will be replacing the deactivated node with a new server:

    1. Sign in to the server.
    2. Remove the server from the domain.
    3. Rename the server.
    4. Make a note of the IP address, and then change the IP address to a free address that you have in your range.
    5. Shut down the server.

6. After the server has been shut down, or if it was already down, Service Fabric Explorer reflects its status. Select the ellipsis (**...**) button again next to the node, and then select **Remove node state**.

    ![Remove node state command](media/e0460a280693cdf13896731aa7f2377f.png)

7. Confirm removal of the node.

    ![Confirmation of node removal](media/a711e04b14b8adddc5d3941f010b32e0.png)

    After the node has been removed, its status is shown as **Invalid**.

    ![Node that has Invalid status](media/c3f8dc79d51e535074e89dfca04006b8.png)

8. Make a note of the node name and type. For this example, the node name is **AOS1**, and the type is **AOSNodeType**. Remember that the node name might not match the network name. Also make a note of the **Upgrade Domain** and **Fault Domain** settings, and the IP address. The previous illustration shows all these values.

## Add a node

The next step is to start a new AOS server.

1. Follow these steps if you're replacing an existing server that was removed:

    1. Give the server the network name of the previous AOS server.
    2. Assign the original IP address. For this example, that IP address is **10.0.0.9**.
    3. Join the server to the domain.

2. If you're adding a new server to an existing cluster, update the ConfigTemplate.xml file so that it contains the additional information. This information will be used when you push out the prerequisites and apply settings through Windows PowerShell scripts.
3. Make sure that you've added the **AXServiceUser** and **svc-AXSF\$** group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) to the local admin group on the AOS server.

    After the server is connected to the domain, you must follow the prerequisite steps for on-premises environments in [Set up and deploy on-premises environments (Platform update 12 and later)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-pu12#follow-these-steps-for-each-vm-or-use-remoting-from-a-single-machine). The following steps summarize those prerequisite steps.

4. Copy the contents of each infrastructure\\VMs\<VMName\> folder into the corresponding virtual machine (VM). (If you use remoting scripts, they will automatically copy the contents to the target VMs.) Then run the following Windows PowerShell scripts as an admin.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're running remotely and repairing an existing server, you must delete the lbdscripts_remote_status.json file from the infrastructure folder to ensure the file copy process is run against all servers again.

    ```powershell
    # Install pre-req software on the VMs.
    # If Remoting, execute
    # .\Configure-PreReqs-AllVMs.ps1 -MSIFilePath <share folder path of the MSIs> -ConfigurationFilePath .\ConfigTemplate.xml
    .\Configure-PreReqs.ps1 -MSIFilePath <share folder path of the MSIs>
    ```

5. Restart the computer every time that you're prompted. Make sure that you rerun theÂ **.\\Configure-PreReqs.ps1**Â script after every restart, until all the prerequisites are installed. In the case of remoting, rerun the **AllVMs** script when all the computers are back online.
6. If you use the remoting script, make sure that the current user has access to the share folder of Microsoft Windows Installer package files (.msi files).
7. If you use the remoting script, make sure that no user is accessing computers of the **AOSNodeType**, **MRType**, and **ReportServerType** types. Otherwise, the remoting script won't be able to restart the computer because users are signed in to it.
8. Run the following scripts, if they exist, to complete the VM setup.

    ```powershell
    # If Remoting, only execute
    # .\Complete-PreReqs-AllVMs.ps1 -ConfigurationFilePath .\ConfigTemplate.xml
    .\Add-GMSAOnVM.ps1
    .\Import-PfxFiles.ps1
    .\Set-CertificateAcls.ps1
    ```

9. If errors occur while you run **Add-GMSAonVM.ps1**, you must run the following command. (Edit the command if your service account differs. Note that you remove the dollar sign \[\$\] from the service account name.)

    ```powershell
    Get-ADServiceAccount -Identity svc-AXSF -properties PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword
    ```

    ![Get command and result](media/525f31b6281e87fd58075f2101f75118.png)

    You see a list of the servers that have permission to retrieve the password for the **svc-AXFS\$** gMSA. If you see a globally unique identifier (GUID) value for the server that was removed, ignore it.

10. Copy the list of principals from the result, and use them to edit or amend the following command. (Note that, because the **Set** command isn't additive, you must add all references back in.)

    ```powershell
    Set-ADServiceAccount -Identity svc-AXSF -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword  "CN=AOS1,CN=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com","CN=AOS2,CN=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com","CN=AOS3,CN=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com"
    ```

    ![Set command](media/ff652391b87c72cacd318b588758e4fc.png)

11. Run the original **Get** command to verify that the new AOS node was added back in. (Note in the example screenshot below you can see that AOS1 was added to the list of PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword.)

    ![Original Get command and result](media/17b9c379b6328ed506d16270280146f4.png)

12. Run the following script to validate the VM setup.

    ```powershell
    # If Remoting, execute
    # .\Test-D365FOConfiguration-AllVMs.ps1 -ConfigurationFilePath .\ConfigTemplate.xml
    .\Test-D365FOConfiguration.ps1
    ```

13. Before you continue, fix anything that fails as part of the validation script.
14. In Service Fabric Explorer, select **Cluster**, and make a note of the Microsoft Service Fabric cluster version. For this example, the cluster version is **6.5.676.9590**.

    ![Cluster version](media/fe0c857aefd3a1174df38f8e0c644667.png)

15. On one of the orchestrator nodes, open File Explorer. On the **View** tab, in the **Show/hide** group, make sure that the **File name extensions** and **Hidden items** check boxes are selected.

    ![View options](media/bb83d249cdce333bdbb2e276ebce559c.png)

16. Expand drive C, and then drill down into the following folder. (Note that the bold parts of the path will vary, depending on the node name and setup.)

    C:\\ProgramData\\SF\\**ORCH1**\\Fabric\\work\\Applications\\\_\_FabricSystem\\**_App4294967295**\\work\\Store\\**131811633624852852**

    In the folder, you should see a list of folders for various versions of Service Fabric. Here is an example.

    ![Contents of the 131811633624852852 folder](media/f843b5ceda67f767f54333851f5deeec.png)

17. Open the folder that has the same name as the version of Microsoft Service Fabric cluster that you made a note of earlier. For this example, the folder is named **6.5.676.9590**.
18. In the folder, you should see a .cab file.

    ![Contents of the 6.5.676.9590 folder](media/fd04e00bc3d940f5637900e46db8f134.png)

19. Copy the .cab file to C:\\Temp, and rename the copied file **MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric.cab**. (If you don't have a Temp folder, create it.)

    ![Copied and renamed file in the Temp folder](media/e146a300f030d0695be858d8c7261486.png)

20. Open a Windows PowerShell Command Prompt windows as an admin.
21. Run the following command to connect to your Service Fabric cluster. (Edit the command as you require.)

    ```powershell
    #Connect to Service Fabric Cluster. Replace 123 with server/star thumbprint and use appropriate IP address
    Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -connectionEndpoint 10.0.0.12:19000 -X509Credential -FindType FindByThumbprint -FindValue 123 -ServerCertThumbprint 123
    ```

    ![Connect command and result](media/0af2777b388b786d2ba6fe0b1f0f77dc.png)

22. Run the following command to add the node back in. Before you run it, make the required edits to the **NodeName**, **IPAddress**, **UpgradeDomain**, and **FaultDomain** parameters. (If you're replacing an existing server, you should have made a note of the values earlier.)

    ```powershell
    Add-ServiceFabricNode -NodeName "AOS1" -NodeType "AOSNodeType" -IpAddressOrFQDN "10.0.0.9" -UpgradeDomain "ud0" -FaultDomain "fd:/fd0" -FabricRuntimePackagePath "C:\Temp\MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric.cab"
    ```

    ![Add command and result](media/e8c153c1b8aa06af684a307f443c9b7b.png)

23. After the node has been added back in, return to Service Fabric Explorer, and view the application deployment status. Several minutes will be required before all the AOS applications are restored (**AXBootstrapperAppType**, **AXSFType**, **RTGatewayAppType**, and **LBDTelemetryType-<envname\>** or **MonitoringAgentAppType**) are pushed out again and installed on the node.
