# Troubleshoot environments deployed through self-service deployment

This topic explains how you can troubleshoot issues on an environment that was deployed using the [self-service deployment](infrastructure-stack.md) experience. When a user reports an issue, you can use various tools in Lifecycle Services (LCS) for troubleshooting. The rich set of telemetry data helps you build a storyboard view that shows what that user and other users were doing when the issue was reported.

To open the **Environment Monitoring** dashboard, follow the steps listed below:

1. Open LCS and navigate to the appropriate project.
2. In the **Environments** section, select the environment that you want to view, and then click **Full details**.
3. On the **Environment details** page, click **Environment monitoring** to open the Monitoring and diagnostics portal.

On the Environment Monitoring dashboard, you will see two tabs: **Overview** and **Activity**.

## Overview tab

The **Overview** tab provides a storyboard view that shows how the environment was being used during a specific period. You can use the filters on this page to narrow the information logs. Here are some of the filters that are available:

  - **Time duration**: Go back 60 minutes from the selected date and time.
  - **User**: View a specific user's activities.
  - **Search terms**: Create a search that is based on the issue that is being investigated.

In addition, you will also see two sections:

  - The **User interaction** chart shows a user's activities on various machines in the environment and the SQL utilization trend.
  - The **User activity** grid shows the various activities that users performed, based on their session timestamp. The active sessions display on the left side of the grid. For each session, the Form:Control:Command and the corresponding timestamp show when the action was taken. You can trace the exact steps that the user was taking in the information presented in this grid.
  
 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > The Overview tab will also include the CPU and memory health metrics to help with diagnostics.  This feature is currently not available but will be added soon. 

## Activity tab

The **Activity** tab shows a predefined set of queries for advanced troubleshooting. This gives you access to the raw information logs. You can then export the logs to do more advanced analysis. The following types of queries are available:

  - User-related errors
  - Slow queries
  - Deadlocks
  - Crashes

> [!NOTE]
> The data shown on the **Overview** and **Activity** tabs is only retained for 30 days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Environment monitoring will also include advanced SQL troubleshooting tools to diagnose and mitigate performance issues. This feature is currently not available but will be added soon.
