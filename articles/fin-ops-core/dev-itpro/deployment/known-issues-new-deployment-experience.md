# Known issues with self-service deployment

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include [banner](../includes/limited-availability.md)]

This article describes the known issues with [self-service deployment](infrastructure-stack.md).

## Lifecycle Services (LCS)

### Features not intended to be implemented
The following LCS features will not be implemented in self-service deployment.

- **System diagnostics** - All data and functionality provided by system diagnostics today will be available through other features in the product and LCS. 
 - **Service requests** - Service requests are being replaced with self-service actions. 

### Known issues in this release
Know issues are bugs that will be addressed in upcoming releases. Every 2 weeks there is a new release of LCS.

## finance and operations apps 

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 Commerce is implemented in the modern deployment experience with the 10.0.10 release. For more information, see [Create payment packaging for Application Explorer for self-service deployment](../../../commerce/dev-itpro/payment-connector-package.md).

### Features not intended to be implemented
The following feature will not be implemented in self-service deployment.

- **Custom fonts** - Custom fonts are not supported. For more information, see [Document Reporting Service in Dynamics 365 applications](../analytics/reporting-experience-iias-environments.md).
- **Customizations related to user interface (UI) components on self service** - Customizations that do not use the standard Financial Reporting or SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) in finance and operations apps often take a dependency on UI components of the operating system where the AOS runs. Example dependencies include Windows fonts, web browsers such as Internet Explorer, or custom PDF rendering. We do not ensure the host operating system will include any support for font infrastructure, web browsers, or any general UI components. The host operating system will change when migrating to self-service infrastructure. If you have such dependencies and have additional questions, please contact Microsoft Support.

### Features no longer supported
The following feature is no longer supported with self-service deployment.

#### FTP
Customizations relying on FTP are not supported with self-service deployment. You should consider the following information:

- We do not ensure that all outbound requests from an Application Object Server (AOS) are on a static IP address. 

- Until June 2021, we will ensure that all outbound requests during a particular AOS session will be on the same IP address. This can have implications for some processes, such as FTP. We recommend removing the use of FTP by using Power Apps to pull the files in and make API calls into finance and operations apps to import the files using the Data Integration framework. For more information, see [Data entities integration overview](../data-entities/integration-overview.md). Some specific examples include:

  - Use the native SFTP connector (as described in [Monitor, create, and manage SFTP files in Azure Logic Apps](/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-sftp)), which still requires some port opening on the firewall to call the on-premises service. Consider that for Logic Apps, the list of IPs is much shorter than the entire [region allowlist](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#outbound) and the [limits and configuration in Power Automate](/power-automate/limits-and-config#logic-apps).

  - Use the “Local Filesystem” connector, as described in [Outbound IP addresses](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#outbound), in combination with the on-premises data gateway. For more information, see [Install on-premises data gateway for Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install). This solution completely removes the need for the IP allowlist, which is deprecated in self-service deployment, while keeping a very high-level of security.

  - Self-service capabilities:  If FTP scenarios are failing after migrating to self-service capabilities, review the configuration at the FTP server. The most common scenario is the need to update the allowed [IP list](deploymentFAQ.md#for-my-microsoft-managed-environments-i-have-external-components-that-have-dependencies-on-an-explicit-outbound-ip-safe-list-how-can-i-ensure-my-service-is-not-impacted-after-the-move-to-self-service-deployment) with the ranges for self-service environments.
