# Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, and Commerce in local geographies

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Data residency

Microsoft Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps are generally available to support data residency in specific geographies. These deployment options serve customers in regulated industries and commercial organizations that do business with entities in specific geographies that require local data residency.

All required services and related data are deployed in the corresponding data centers of the geography. These services and data include Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), telemetry, databases, and environments. Customer data doesn't leave the geographic boundary.

### Supported local geographies and endpoints

The following table lists the local geographies and endpoints that Commerce, Finance, and Supply Chain Management support.
