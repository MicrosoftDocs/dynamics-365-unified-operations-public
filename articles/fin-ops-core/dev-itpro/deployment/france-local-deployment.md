# Finance and Operations apps in France

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Finance and Operations apps, Power Apps, and Power Automate are available in France’s datacenters. This new deployment option serves customers in regulated industry and commercial organizations that do business with entities in France that require local data residency. 

The deployment of the Dynamics 365 services in France is built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy, compliance, transparency, and reliability. This deployment provides French organizations a complete cloud infrastructure and platform, and familiar productivity and business application tools. All of this means that customer data stays resident within France.

The prerequisite to deploy to France is to use the localized version of Lifecycle Services (LCS), referred to as [Go Local LCS, FR.LCS.Dynamics.com](https://fr.lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Index). If you’re interested in local deployment to a specific region, contact Microsoft to learn more about the onboarding process and potential limitations.

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available service and Dynamics 365 offerings in France. However, there are a few exceptions affected by dependent service or partner-solution availability, market priorities, or compliance regulations.  For more information about these exceptions or for questions about services in France, contact [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Support](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/support/).
