# Finance and Operations apps in France

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

As of July 2019, Finance and Operations apps, Power Apps, and Power Automate are available in Franceâ€™s datacenters. This new deployment option serves customers in regulated industry and commercial organizations that do business with entities in France that require local data residency. Power BI has been available since March 2019.

The deployment of the Dynamics 365 services in France, are built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy, compliance, transparency, and reliability, offering French organizations a complete cloud infrastructure and platform, as well as familiar productivity and business application tools. All of this means that customer data stays resident within France.

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available service and Dynamics 365 offerings in France. However, there are few exceptions affected by dependent service or partner-solution availability, market priorities, or compliance regulations. For more information about these exceptions or for questions about services in France, contact [Microsoft Dynamics Online support](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/support/).
