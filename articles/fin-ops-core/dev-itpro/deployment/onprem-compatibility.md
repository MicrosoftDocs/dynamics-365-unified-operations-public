## Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a server role that can be installed on a machine running Windows Server. 

| Version                                                     | Supported since  | End of life   |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - AD FS on Windows Server 2016 only supports authentication through the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL).
> - In order to uptake the upcoming migration to the Microsoft Authentication Library, you need to deploy your AD FS on Windows Server 2019 
> (MSAL). For more information, see [Migrate applications to the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-migration).
> - After July 1, 2022, any customers still using AD FS on Windows Server 2016 will no longer be able to use the Office add-ins. This is irrespective of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises) version that they are running.
