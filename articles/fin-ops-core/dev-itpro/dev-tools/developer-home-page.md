# Develop and customize home page

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides links to topics about development.

## Overview

The Finance and Operations applications represent the next-generation enterprise resource planning (ERP) offering from Microsoft. The apps enable the entire ERP application suite as a cloud-based solution, for both public and private clouds, as well as on-premises. The apps leverage the speed, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness of working in the cloud, while building on the latest technology from Microsoft. The development experience includes:

- Development tools that are decoupled from any running environment. You develop against local, XML-based files, not the online database.
- Microsoft Visual Studio is the development environment. The Visual Studio environment is customized to provide you with a smooth and familiar experience.
- The X++ compiler generates Common Intermediate Language (CIL) for all features. CIL is the same intermediate language used by other .NET-based (managed) languages, such as the C\# programming language.
- You can leverage the browser-based client and the design patterns for forms to provide an improved end-user experience.
- The Application Lifecycle Model (ALM) supports build automation, test automation, and deployment of models to the cloud.
