# Upload assets by using Azure Pipelines

You can automate the upload of assets to the Asset library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) by using the **Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) Asset Upload** task in Azure DevOps. This task is available only in **Releases** pipelines.

This article assumes you have a working knowledge of [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can add these steps to a pipeline, the [Dynamics 365 finance and operations Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dyn365FinOps.dynamics365-finops-tools) extension for Azure DevOps must be enabled and installed in the Azure DevOps account. For more information about how to install an extension for an organization, see [Install extensions](/azure/devops/marketplace/install-extension).

## Make sure that MSAL.PS is installed

Versions 1.\* and later of the upload task require availability of the MSAL.PS PowerShell library. A task is available to automatically install the tools during pipeline execution. This task can be added anywhere in the stage before the upload task. For more information, see [Add the MSAL.PS install task to a pipeline](pipeline-lcs-connection-update.md#add-the-msalps-install-task-to-a-pipeline).

## Add the task to a pipeline

To add the task to the build of your YML or Classic pipeline, search the task list for **Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) Asset Upload**.

The following table describes the options that are available for this task.

| Input name | Mandatory | Description |

| LCS Connection | Yes | Select or create a service connection to LCS. For more information, see [Create an LCS connection in Azure Pipelines](pipeline-lcs-connection.md). |

| File to upload | Yes | Enter the path of the file that you want to upload into the Asset library in LCS. |
