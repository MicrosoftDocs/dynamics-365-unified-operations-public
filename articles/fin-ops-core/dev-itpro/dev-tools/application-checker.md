# Application checker

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The application checker tool is a set of technologies that allow you to gain insight into your application code (both source and metadata) in ways that have not been possible before. The technology is based on representing both source code and metadata in XML and providing rich search facilities by using the XQuery language to express declarative queries over the source code. The current implementation runs inside a BaseX repository, which runs locally on the developer's box. 

For information about how to install and use the application checker, see [Dynamics365FO-AppChecker](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365FO-AppChecker).
