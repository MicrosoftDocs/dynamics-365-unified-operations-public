For more information, see <a href="issue-search-lcs.md">Issue search (Lifecycle Services, LCS)</a>.</td>

<td>Get support within your finance and operations app.</td>
<td>Select the <strong>Help</strong> button (<strong>?</strong>) in the upper-right corner of the app, and then select <strong>Support</strong>.

<td>In <a href="https://lcs.dynamics.com/">LCS</a>, the <strong>Support</strong> tile opens a tool that helps you manage support incidents. To submit issues directly to Microsoft, select the <strong>Support</strong> tile in your LCS project. You can then submit issues in two ways:
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>Active issue</strong> tab, select your issue, and then select <strong>Submit to Microsoft</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Submitted to Microsoft</strong> tab, select <strong>Submit an incident</strong>, and then follow the on-screen instructions to submit the incident.
