<table>
<tbody>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Replaced by another feature?</strong></td>
<td>No</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Status</strong></td>
<td>Deprecated: The flowchart diagrams component in BPM is expected to be removed by early February 2020. The following functionality will be removed:
<ul>
<li>Existing flowcharts will be unavailable for viewing or editing. The shape properties that are associated with flowchart activities will also be unavailable, because the whole <strong>Flowchart</strong> tab will be removed. These flowcharts include both the default flowcharts that are automatically generated and customized flowcharts that are modified based on those default flowcharts.</li>
<li>The legacy fit/gap analysis feature will be unavailable. Therefore, no gap list will be automatically created or available for export.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature had previously been deprecated and replaced by Microsoft Azure DevOps integrations.</p>
</li>
<li>The version history of the flowchart will be unavailable.</li>
</ul>
