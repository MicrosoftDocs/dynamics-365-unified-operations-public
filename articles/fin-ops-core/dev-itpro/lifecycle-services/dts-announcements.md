[!include[preview banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article provides information about the new or changed features in Microsoft Dynamics Translation Service (DTS).

## Incident: DTS API failures impacting extension users

We are investigating an issue where our extension users are experiencing intermittent API failures. This is an active incident which may impacting the usability of the DTS extensions for a subset of users. Please reach out to dtssup@microsoft.com if you require more immediate support. 

## DTS will stop supporting Dynamics AX 2012 by March 31, 2023

Mainstream and extended support for Dynamics AX 2012 has ended. DTS will end support for Dynamics AX 2012 R3 by March 31, 2023. 

## Visual Studio Code extension

The Visual Studio Code extension was created for Dynamics 365 Business Central users who develop extensions in AL by using the AL language extension. The Visual Studio Code extension provides a DTS integration into the AL environment for Business Central developers.

The following features are included in the Visual Studio Code extension:

- **DTS Translation** – Create translation requests for resource files in a workspace.
- **Resource file explorer** – View and manage existing resource files.

To download the Visual Studio Code extension, go to [Dynamics 365 Translation Service Visual Studio Code extension on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dts-publisher.dts-vsc). For more details about it, see [Dynamics 365 Translation Service Visual Studio Code extension](dts-vscode-doc.md).

## Visual Studio extension release

The DTS extension for Visual Studio was created so that finance and operations developers can perform actions in DTS directly from their Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). To use the DTS Visual Studio extension, you must have access to Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services. Additionally, the extension is intended primarily to support the development workflow for finance and operations apps in Visual Studio.

The following features are included in the Visual Studio extension release:

- **Translation** – Create translation requests for label resource files in the project.
- **Regenerate** – Post-edit the XLIFF outputs, and regenerate the label resource files.
- **Align** – Create XLIFF translation memories (TMs) from previously translated label resource files.

To download the Visual Studio extension, go to [Dynamics 365 Translation Service Visual Studio extension on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dts-publisher.dts-vs-ext&ssr=false#overview). For more details about it, see [Dynamics 365 Translation Service Visual Studio extension](dts-visual-studio.md).
