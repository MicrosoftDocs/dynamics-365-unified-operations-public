# Lifecycle Services (LCS) for Finance and Operations apps partners

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how partners can get started with Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). 

As a Finance and Operations partner, you can access the current version  by following the steps in [Sign up for preview subscriptions](../dev-tools/sign-up-preview-subscription.md).

### Projects for partners in LCS

After you sign up as a partner for the current version, you can create two types of projects:

-   Prospective presales
-   Migrate, create solutions, and learn the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps

#### Prospective presales project

Work with new prospects to help them understand the business processes that are available, and to help them evaluate their subscription needs. Note that only partners can provision a new cloud environment.

#### Migrate, create solutions, and learn the project for Finance and Operations apps 

Create a Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 project workspace. You can use the project to support the upgrade from Dynamics AX 2012 to the current version. You can also use the project to learn how to use the current version or create solutions in Microsoft Dynamics AX Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Projects for customers in LCS

For every customer who signs up for LCS, an Implementation project workspace is automatically created during the sign-up process. As a partner, you can't create an Implementation project. For more information about the Implementation project workspace, see [Lifecycle Services (LCS) for Finance and Operations apps customers](lcs-works-lcs.md). Services within project workspaces behave in the same manner. However, an important difference between an Implementation project and other project types is the ability to configure the current version of Finance and Operations, which is managed by Microsoft.
