# Update the local agent

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to update the local agent. The latest version of the local agent is version 3.0.0, which was released in November 2021.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not update the local agent during a servicing operation, even if the preparation phase has completed. 

| Local agent version | Capability | 
|---------------------|------------|
| 3.0.0               | This version includes support for Edge Scale Unit Application Lifecycle Management. |
| 2.7.2               | This version includes a fix for deploying older application versions. | 
| 2.7.1               | This version introduces a new deployment option and fixes a bug with a deployment option. |
| 2.7.0               | Enables deploying or updating to 10.0.21 and later versions. Additionally, this version enables deploying on environments with Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and some bug fixes. |
| 2.6.0               | This version upgrades the Service Fabric SDK, fixes a bug with refresh state, and increases the application provisioning timeout. |
| 2.5.0               | This version updates dependencies and fixes a cleanup bug. |
| 2.4.0               | This version fixes a deployment issue and upgrades the runtime of the local agent. |
| 2.3.1               | This version fixes orchestration service crashes that may occur during clean up on some environments.<br><br>Deploying version 10.0.5 with Platform update 29 or earlier requires the use of pre-deployment scripts for automatic updating of FinancialReportingDeployer.exe.config. For more information, see [Troubleshoot on-premises deployments](../../dev-itpro/deployment/troubleshoot-on-prem.md#FREntityFramework). |
| 2.3.0               | This version adds support for pre- and post-deployment scripts.  |
| 2.2.0               | This version fixes locked dlls during cleanup and enables prerequisites for supporting Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) that also is used for Microsoft 365. |
| 2.1.2               | This version contains updated Azure dependencies for improved download stability and logic to correctly evaluate if files are downloaded. This fixes an issue where files are fully downloaded, but the logic would still consider them as missing a few bytes and therefore fail the download.  |
| 2.1.1               | This version fixes an issue that occurs when the download fails and the Lifecycle Services (LCS) **Maintain** button is not available. Additional changes include updates to Azure storage libraries to improve communication with Azure storage and enable TLS 1.2.  |
| 2.1.0               | This version enables two-phased servicing where **Preparation** and **Update** are two separate steps. |
| 2.0.0               | This version enables servicing flows and deploys Platform update 12. |
| 1.1.0               | This version enables the [Reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md)  for successful deployments, enables multi-model package deployments, and deploys Platform update 8 and 11. | 
| 1.0.0               | This version enables the [Reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md) for failed deployments. |
| Null                | This initial version deploys Platform update 8. |

## What's new in local agent 3.0.0

- Local agent 3.0.0 includes support for managing the lifecycle of Edge Scale Units through the Scale Unit Management portal. For more information, see [Distributed Hybrid Topology](../../../supply-chain/cloud-edge/cloud-edge-landing-page.md).
- This release requires the .NET Framework version 4.8 to uptake the newest changes from LCS.

## What's new in local agent 2.7.2

- Local agent 2.7.2 fixes an issue where environments on older versions of the application would fail to deploy.

## What's new in local agent 2.7.1

- Local agent 2.7.1 introduces a new deployment option to [Specify that checking the Certificate Revocation List of a certificate should be skipped](../../dev-itpro/deployment/onprem-localagent-options.md#specify-that-checking-the-certificate-revocation-list-of-a-certificate-should-be-skipped).
- This release addresses a bug where the **office365AdfsCompatibility** deploymentOption was not being correctly set.

## What's new in local agent 2.7.0

- Local agent 2.7.0 is a prerequisite to deploy or update to 10.0.21 and later releases. 
- This release introduces the possibility of specifying a limited set of deployment options for environment-specific deployment options. Most notably, this release will allow you to deploy on environments with Microsoft SQL Server 2019. For all possible configurations, see [Local agent deployment configurations](../../dev-itpro/deployment/onprem-localagent-options.md).
- Additionally, this release addresses an issue where the gMSA account that the local agent executes under will lose permission to the private key for some certificates.
- The LBDTelemetry-Agent application can start correctly even if the Event Viewer is open. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release **must be used** to deploy or update to 10.0.21 and later releases.
> This release requires that a new local agent configuration file be downloaded from LCS. If you encounter issues, refer to [Troubleshoot on-premises deployments](../../dev-itpro/deployment/troubleshoot-on-prem.md). 

## What's new in local agent 2.6.0

- Local agent 2.6.0 uptakes a new Service Fabric SDK and runtime.
- This release fixes a bug where, if refresh state is triggered when the environment is stuck in the Downloading phase, the environment would automatically move to a deployed state without updating the environment. In this situation, the refresh state will mark the Downloading phase as failed.
- The timeout for provisioning an application has been increased.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release is only compatible with 7.x Service Fabric clusters.

## What's new in local agent 2.5.0

- Local agent 2.5.0 uptakes new versions of various dependencies. The main changes are Service Fabric and Entity Framework.
- This release also fixes a bug where, if cleanup fails without cleaning up any services, subsequent reattempts always fail during cleanup.

## What's new in local agent 2.4.0

- Local agent 2.4.0 now requires the .NET Framework version 4.7.2 to uptake the newest changes from LCS. To meet the newest requirements, be sure to run the latest infrastructure scripts that are available in LCS.
- This release also fixes an issue where the deployment of the AXService would fail in slower environments due to a hard-coded timeout.

## What's new in local agent 2.3.0

- Local agent 2.3.0 enables the execution of custom [pre- and post- deployment scripts](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/pre-post-scripts.md).
- It fixes the problem introduced in 2.2.0 with regard to deploying older platform updates.
- This release removes the monitoring agent and introduces a new service called LBDTelemetry, which will be used to install the ETWManifests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release requires that a new local agent configuration file be downloaded from LCS. Refer to the [Troubleshoot on-premises deployments](../../dev-itpro/deployment/troubleshoot-on-prem.md) article if you encounter problems. 

## What's new in local agent 2.1.0
- Local agent 2.1.0 enables the two-phased servicing where **Environment preparation** and **Environment update** are two distinct steps and explicit actions. This reduces the total downtime customers must take when applying updates to their on-premises environments by preparing upfront and allowing users to use the environment during preparation and then communicating the downtime when the actual update environment action is triggered.

## What's new in local agent 2.0.0
- Local agent 2.0.0 can deploy Platform update 12.
- It enables the [Reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md) until the first deployment of Platform update 12 succeeds.
- It disables the [Reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md) on the first successful deployment of Platform update 12. After deployment succeeds, you can use the regular update experience to update the environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Local agent 2.0.0 **cannot** deploy Platform update 8 and Platform update 11. You must have version 1.1.0 to deploy those platform updates.

## Download the latest local agent and configuration from LCS

> [!NOTE]
> If you require an older version of the local agent for your current deployments, download it from the Asset library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). To download Local agent version 1.1.0, go to **Shared Asset Library -> Model** and click on Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations on-premises - Local agent v1.1.0**.
>
> You must have version 2.0.0 or later to deploy Platform update 12 and complete update flows.

1. In LCS, select **Project settings** > **On-prem connectors**.
2. Select the connector to your environment, and then select **Edit**.
3. On the menu on the left side of the page, select **Setup host infrastructure**, and then select **Download agent installer**.

    You must now verify that the zip file that is downloaded and unblocked.

4. Go to the zip file, right-click it, and then select **Properties**.
5. In the **Properties** dialog box, select **Unblock**, and then select **Apply**.
6. On the **Configure agent** tab, select **Download configurations** to download the localagent-config.json configuration file.

## Update the local agent

1. Copy the zip file and the localagent-config.json file into one of the **Orchestrator** nodes, such as **c:\\DynamicsAgent** in the **Orch1** virtual machine (VM).
2. Unzip the agent installer to C:\\DynamicsAgent\\LocalAgent.
3. Copy the localagent-config.json file to C:\\DynamicsAgent\\LocalAgent.
4. In a **Command Prompt** window, go to C:\\DynamicsAgent\\LocalAgent, and run the following command.

    ```Console
    LocalAgentCLI.exe Cleanup <path of localagent-config.json>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must use the current agent's binaries to clean up the agent. If you don't have the current agent's binaries, you can delete the local agent application from Service Fabric Explorer.

5. Press any key to exit the cleanup operation.
6. Verify that the local agent has been successfully cleaned up by looking in Service Fabric Explorer and making sure that there are no apps in the **Deployed Applications** section in the **Orchestrator** nodes.
7. After the local agent is successfully cleaned up, run the following command.

    ```Console
    LocalAgentCLI.exe Install <path of localagent-config.json>
    ```

8. After the local agent is successfully installed, go back to your on-premises connector in LCS.
9. On the **Validate setup** tab, select **Message agent** to test LCS connectivity to your new local agent.
