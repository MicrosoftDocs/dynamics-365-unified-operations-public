- This release addresses a bug where the **office365AdfsCompatibility** deploymentOption wasn't being correctly set.

## What's new in local agent 2.7.0

- Local agent 2.7.0 is a prerequisite to deploy or update to 10.0.21 and later releases. 
- This release introduces the possibility of specifying a limited set of deployment options for environment-specific deployment options. Most notably, this release will allow you to deploy on environments with Microsoft SQL Server 2019.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release is only compatible with 7.x Service Fabric clusters.

## What's new in local agent 2.5.0

- Local agent 2.5.0 uptakes new versions of various dependencies. The main changes are Service Fabric and Entity Framework.
- This release also fixes a bug where, if cleanup fails without cleaning up any services, subsequent reattempts always fail during cleanup.

## What's new in local agent 2.4.0

- Local agent 2.4.0 now requires the .NET Framework version 4.7.2 to uptake the newest changes from Lifecycle Services. To meet the newest requirements, be sure to run the latest infrastructure scripts that are available in Lifecycle Services.
- This release also fixes an issue where the deployment of the AXService would fail in slower environments due to a hard-coded timeout.

## What's new in local agent 2.3.0

- Local agent 2.3.0 enables the execution of custom [pre- and post- deployment scripts](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/pre-post-scripts.md).
- It fixes the problem introduced in 2.2.0 with regard to deploying older platform updates.
- This release removes the monitoring agent and introduces a new service called LBDTelemetry, which will be used to install the ETWManifests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release requires that a new local agent configuration file be downloaded from Lifecycle Services. Refer to the [Troubleshoot on-premises deployments](../../dev-itpro/deployment/troubleshoot-on-prem.md) article if you encounter problems. 

## What's new in local agent 2.1.0
- Local agent 2.1.0 enables the two-phased servicing where **Environment preparation** and **Environment update** are two distinct steps and explicit actions. This reduces the total downtime customers must take when applying updates to their on-premises environments by preparing upfront and allowing users to use the environment during preparation and then communicating the downtime when the actual update environment action is triggered.

## What's new in local agent 2.0.0
- Local agent 2.0.0 can deploy Platform update 12.
- It enables the [Reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md) until the first deployment of Platform update 12 succeeds.
- It disables the [Reconfigure feature](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/reconfigure-environment.md) on the first successful deployment of Platform update 12. After deployment succeeds, you can use the regular update experience to update the environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Local agent 2.0.0 **cannot** deploy Platform update 8 and Platform update 11. You must have version 1.1.0 to deploy those platform updates.

## Download the latest local agent and configuration from Lifecycle Services

> [!NOTE]
> If you require an older version of the local agent for your current deployments, download it from the Asset library in Lifecycle Services. To download Local agent version 1.1.0, go to **Shared Asset Library > Model** and click on Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (on-premises) - Local agent v1.1.0**.
>
> You must have version 2.0.0 or later to deploy Platform update 12 and complete update flows.

1. In Lifecycle Services, select **Project settings** > **On-prem connectors**.
2. Select the connector to your environment, and then select **Edit**.
3. On the menu on the left side of the page, select **Setup host infrastructure**, and then select **Download agent installer**.

    You must now verify that the zip file that is downloaded and unblocked.

4. Go to the zip file, right-click it, and then select **Properties**.
5. In the **Properties** dialog box, select **Unblock**, and then select **Apply**.
6. On the **Configure agent** tab, select **Download configurations** to download the localagent-config.json configuration file.

## Update the local agent

### Clean up the existing local agent

1. Fine the folder that you previously installed the local agent from.
1. In a PowerShell window, navigate to that folder, and run the following command.

    ```Console
    LocalAgentCLI.exe Cleanup <path of localagent-config.json>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must use the current agent's binaries to clean up the agent. If you don't have the current agent's binaries, you can delete the local agent application from Service Fabric Explorer.

1. Select any key to exit the cleanup operation.
1. Verify that the local agent has been successfully cleaned up by looking in Service Fabric Explorer and making sure that there are no apps in the **Deployed Applications** section in the **Orchestrator** nodes.

### Install the new local agent

1. Copy the zip file and the localagent-config.json file that you previously downloaded into the file share where you placed your **infrastructure** folder (for example, \\\\LBDFFILE01\\Install)).
1. Unzip the agent installer to \\\\LBDFFILE01\\Install\LocalAgent.
1. Copy the localagent-config.json file to \\\\LBDFFILE01\\Install\LocalAgent.
1. In a PowerShell window, navigate to \\\\LBDFFILE01\\Install\LocalAgent, and run the following command.

    ```Console
    LocalAgentCLI.exe Install <path of localagent-config.json>
    ```

1. After the local agent is successfully installed, go back to your on-premises connector in Lifecycle Services.
1. On the **Validate setup** tab, select **Message agent** to test Lifecycle Services connectivity to your new local agent.

## Local agent expiration dates

After the date when a local agent becomes expired, it can no longer communicate with Lifecycle Services. Therefore, you will have to update your local agent to a supported version. Going forward, we plan to support only a few versions of the local agent at a time. The two most recently released versions won't receive an expiration date until a new version has been released. At that point, the oldest version that doesn't have an expiration date will receive an expiration date. The expiration date will be set a few months into the future, so that customers have time to upgrade to a newer version.

> [!NOTE]
> A released local agent version will be supported for at least six months.
