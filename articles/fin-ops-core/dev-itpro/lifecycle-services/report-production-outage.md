# Report a production outage

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Lifecycle Services has a feature called **Report production outage**. All customers who purchase one or more Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps and create implementation projects with a production environment deployed in Lifecycle Services can use this feature. It provides a quick and effective way to escalate issues to Microsoft Support if the services in a production environment are degraded or become unavailable.

A production outage exists when one or more system-wide problems on a live production environment impact multiple users and prevent your business from performing daily operations.

## Reporting flow

Handle an issue in the following order:

1. In a live production environment, a customer experiences an outage or other situation that prevents business from continuing.
1. The customer reports a production outage issue by using the Lifecycle Services Support portal.
1. The customer selects a production outage issue and provides additional information.
1. A Microsoft support engineer acknowledges the production outage ticket within 30 minutes of submission and immediately begins collaborating with stakeholders to investigate and resolve the problem.
1. A support engineer contacts the customer to provide a status update.

## Access and availability

All users who are added to a customer's implementation project have access to this feature. This access includes project owners, organization admins, team members, and environment managers.

This feature is available for:

- Dynamics 365 Finance
- Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management
- Environments that Microsoft manages
- A production environment in the Lifecycle Services project
- All support plans

1. Confirm the production outage, select the outage scenario from the drop-down list, and then select **Continue**.
1. Add a title and details about the outage, and then select **Next**.
1. Provide contact information, and then select **Next**.
1. Select **Done**.

If you can't report a production outage in Lifecycle Services, [phone support](cloud-powered-support-lcs.md#phone-support) is available.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see your situation listed in the outage scenarios, enter a support incident through Lifecycle Services. During the initial investigation by a Microsoft support engineer, if it's found that the situation doesn't meet the current list of production outage scenarios, the support incident is transferred to the correct support team and service-level agreement (SLA)  based on your current support plan.
