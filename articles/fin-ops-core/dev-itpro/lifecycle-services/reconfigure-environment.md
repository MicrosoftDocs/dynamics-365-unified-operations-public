# Reconfigure environments to take a new platform or topology

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about how to reconfigure your environment with a new platform or topology and how to update the configuration of your existing environment.  

## Prerequisites
Before you complete the steps in this article, you must update your local agent. For more information, see the article, [Update the local agent](update-local-agent.md). The procedure in this article will only work with local agents that are on or above version 1.1.0. 

## Reconfigure your environment

1. In Lifecycle Services (LCS), navigate to your on-premises project and open the **Environments** blade. 

2. Do one of the following based on whether you are going to reconfigure or take a new deployment.

- If you need to reconfigure your environment, click **Reconfigure**.
- If you need to take a new deployment or topology, select the new topology for your platform and enter the environment name. You can use the same name or enter a new one. 
  
3. Click **Advanced Settings** to update your configuration. The configuration from your previous deployment will be saved.
