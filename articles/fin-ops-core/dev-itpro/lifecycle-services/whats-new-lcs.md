# What's new or changed in Lifecycle Services (LCS)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) provides a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and their partners can use to manage projects from pre-sales through implementation and operations. LCS provides checklists and tools to help you manage your project, based on the phase of the project and the industry that you're working in. It also provides a dashboard, so that you have a single location where you can obtain up-to-date project information.

To get started with LCS, see the [Lifecycle Services (LCS) user guide](lcs-user-guide.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LCS features and service changes will no longer be announced via blog posts. Descriptions of LCS features are provided in the [release plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010158). This topic lists the features that are included in LCS releases.

## February 2020 - wave 2

| Area | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Environment actions | **Platform update 20 or higher required for database movement operations** - Starting in March 2020, the ability to perform database movement operations (refresh, import, export, and point-in-time restore) will require a minimum of Platform update 20. This change will help support the stability of the service. |

## February 2020 - wave 1

| Area | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Admin APIs | **Database movement RESTful APIs** - LCS will expose RESTful API endpoints. Documentation that covers how to authenticate and make the appropriate calls to trigger refresh will be provided. To implement this functionality, use Microsoft Azure Logic Apps or other recurrence engines for scheduling and automation. |

## LCS releases before November 2019

For information about LCS releases that occurred before November 2019, see the blog posts that the Lifecycle Services team published on the [Dynamics 365 blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/author/lifecycle-services-team/).
