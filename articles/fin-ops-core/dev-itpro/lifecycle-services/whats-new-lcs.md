# What's new or changed in Lifecycle Services (LCS)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) provides a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and their partners can use to manage projects from pre-sales through implementation and operations. LCS provides checklists and tools to help you manage your project, based on the phase of the project and the industry that you're working in. It also provides a dashboard, so that you have a single location where you can obtain up-to-date project information.

To get started with LCS, see the [Lifecycle Services (LCS) user guide](lcs-user-guide.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LCS features and service changes will no longer be announced via blog posts. Descriptions of LCS features are provided in the [release plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010158). This topic lists the features that are included in LCS releases.

## February 2020

| Area | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Admin application programming interfaces (APIs) | **Database movement RESTful APIs:** LCS will expose RESTful API endpoints. Documentation that covers how to authenticate and make the appropriate calls to trigger refresh will be provided.  This functionality can be exercised by using Azure LogicApps or other recurrence engines to provide scheduling and automation. |
