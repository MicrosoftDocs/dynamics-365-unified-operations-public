# What's new or changed in Lifecycle Services (LCS)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) provides a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and their partners can use to manage projects from pre-sales through implementation and operations. LCS provides checklists and tools to help you manage your project, based on the phase of the project and the industry that you're working in. It also provides a dashboard, so that you have a single location where you can obtain up-to-date project information.

To get started with LCS, see the [Lifecycle Services (LCS) user guide](lcs-user-guide.md).
