# What's new in Lifecycle Services (LCS)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) provides a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and their partners can use to manage projects from pre-sales to implementation and operations. Based on the phase of your project and the industry that you are working in, the site provides checklists and tools that help you manage the project. The site also provides a dashboard, so that you have a single location from which you can obtain up-to-date project information. 

To get started using Lifecycle Services, see the [Lifecycle Services (LCS) user guide](lcs-user-guide.md).

> Lifecycle Services will no longer announce features or service changes via blog post. Descriptions of LCS features are provided in the [Release plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010158). This topic lists the features that are included in each LCS release.
