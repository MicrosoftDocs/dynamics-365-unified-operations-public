# Dynamics 365 Translation Service API

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Translation Service (DTS) API is designed to help developers interact with our service and create custom API clients. For example, you can translate user interface (UI) files and regenerate the translations.  

The documentation for the API is available from the [Swagger page](https://aka.ms/DTSSwaggerUI). Through the Swagger UI, you can see the input and output schemas and test all the endpoints in real-time. Most endpoints are protected which requires Bearer authentication. For guidance on authenticating with the API, see [Dynamics Lifecycle Services API Authentication](lcs-aad-app-reg.md).
