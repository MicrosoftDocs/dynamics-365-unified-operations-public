This article lists the features that are included in the platform updates for version 10.0.29 of finance and operations apps. This version has a build number of 7.0.6545 and is available on the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** August 2022
- **General availability of release (self-update):** September 2022
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** September 2022

## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release.

| Module or feature area | Feature name | More information | Enabled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data management | <p>**Refresh entity list**</p><p>Refresh entity list has been refactored so that it always run in a batch.</p> | Not applicable | Default |
| Data integration | <p>**User-based service protection API limits**</p><p>User-based service protection API limits help protect system performance and availability from harm by individual users or integrations. The limits are designed to protect the service when client applications make extraordinary demands on server resources through integrations with Open Data Protocol (OData) or custom service APIs.</p><p>In this release, the feature is optional and is disabled by default. In version 10.0.30, the user-based API limits will be enabled by default but can optionally be disabled. The feature is targeted to become mandatory in version 10.0.33.</p> | [Service protection API limits](../data-entities/service-protection-api-limits.md) | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) |
| Web client | <p>**Extended grid aggregation capabilities**</p><p>This feature extends the current "totals" feature in the grid by letting users select one of four aggregation functions for each numeric column. Grid columns can now be configured to show the minimum value, maximum value, or average value in addition to a total. If grouping has been done in the grid, the selected aggregation function for the column will also be shown for each group.</p> | [Grid capabilities](../../fin-ops/get-started/grid-capabilities.md) | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) |
| Web client | <p>**Saved views performance enhancement**</p><p>This feature helps improve performance when the default view is loaded at page load, by minimizing the number of times that the query is run. To achieve this result, the feature changes when specific parts of the default view are applied, so that all query-related changes are in place when the form initially runs its query.</p> | [Build forms that fully utilize saved views](../user-interface/understanding-saved-views.md) | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) |
| Web client | <p>**Evaluating math expressions in numeric cells outside the grid**</p><p>To help improve user productivity, numeric cells in the new grid have long enabled users to enter mathematical expressions directly in them. (For example, if a user enters **=15\*4** and then selects **Enter**, the expression is evaluated, and a value of **60** is entered in the cell.) As of this release, this support for mathematical expressions has been extended to numeric controls outside the grid.</p> | [Grid capabilities](../../fin-ops/get-started/grid-capabilities.md#evaluating-math-expressions) | Default |

### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of finance and operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

A deprecation notice will be added in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic 12 months before the removal of any feature from the product.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but that are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
