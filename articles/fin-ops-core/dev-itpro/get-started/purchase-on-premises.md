# Buy Finance + Operations (on-premises)

[!include [banner](../../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises) offers various license types to best suit the needs of your organization. To better understand how Finance + Operations (on-premises) is licensed, work with your partner, who can access the [Licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544). When you're ready to purchase licenses for your organization, work with your partner to follow the steps that are outlined in this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On-premises environments are not supported on any public cloud infrastructure, including Azure. However, they are supported to run on [Microsoft Azure Stack HCI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-stack/hci/) and [Microsoft Azure Stack Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-stack/hub/).

## Purchase a Dynamics 365 cloud subscription license

Thanks to the Dual Use Rights that are mentioned in the [Licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544), a Dynamics 365 cloud subscription license can be used to deploy Finance + Operations (on-premises).

For information about how to purchase a subscription, see [Buy and manage a subscription](../../fin-ops/get-started/before-you-buy.md#step-three-buy-and-manage-a-subscription). After you have a subscription, follow these steps to create your on-premises implementation project.

### Get started with Lifecycle Services 

When you purchase a subscription, it's assigned to your Microsoft Online Services ID. The Microsoft Online Services ID is required to provision and register Microsoft Dynamics 365 applications. The Microsoft Online Services ID is used to provision a Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services project that contains the necessary artifacts for on-premises environments. Lifecycle Services is the service where on-premises environments are provisioned, Business process models are created and uploaded, hotfixes are made available, support cases are entered and managed, subscriptions are validated, and so on.

Before you can create your Lifecycle Services project and begin creating on-premises environments, you need to follow the [Provisioning guide](https://mbs2.microsoft.com/fileexchange/?fileID=7ddd6ddf-aa22-402a-baa1-5405ce0b1076) to obtain an on-premises license.

If you have an existing Microsoft Online Services trial or paid subscription, you already have a Microsoft Online Services ID that was created at the time of sign-up. When you sign in to [Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com), select to use this account for sign-in if you want to use the same Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant for the on-premises environment.

After you've signed in to Lifecycle Services, a cloud project is automatically provisioned for you. However, you need an on-premises project. To create a new on-premises project, follow the [Start a new Lifecycle Services project guide](/dynamics365/project-operations/environment/create-lcs-project) and select the **On-premises implementation** project type. The Lifecycle Services project lets you deploy an on-premises environment. For more information about how to get started with your Lifecycle Services project, see [Set up on-premises projects in Lifecycle Services](../lifecycle-services/lbd-create-lcs-on-prem-project.md).

## Purchase a Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises) license

### Purchase client access licenses

To run on-premises environments, you must obtain the proper number of client access licenses (CALs) for your organization per the licensing guide. The CAL purchased for an individual user determines the functionality that the user has the rights to use. User CALs can be purchased from the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).

### Purchase server licenses

A server license is required for every server that runs Finance + Operations (on-premises). After you purchase your server licenses, work with your partner to download a license file from the [PartnerSource Business Center](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/). Keep this license file handy, because you use the details that it contains when you set up your Lifecycle Services project.

Partners can download a customer's Finance + Operations (on-premises) license file from the PartnerSource Business Center using these steps:

1. Sign in to the [PartnerSource Business Center](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/).
2. Enter the customer name or account number in the **Find A Customer** field, and then click **Search**.
3. Click the company name of the customer. The **Customer Summary** page opens.
4. Under **Registered Products**, click **Registration Keys**.
5. Select **version 07** in the **Request and Display License Keys For Version** field.
6. Click **Display License Keys**.
7. On the **Request License Keys** page, select **Download Current License/Registration Key**.
8. Click **Save As** in the **File Download** dialog box, select the folder where you want to download the license file to in the **Save As** dialog box, and then click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you can't see registration keys in PartnerSource Business Center, make sure that **Can See Registration Keys** is set to **Yes** in your PartnerSource Business Center profile.

### Get started with Lifecycle Services

To purchase Finance + Operations (on-premises), you must have a Microsoft Online Services ID. The Microsoft Online Services ID is used to provision a Lifecycle Services project that contains the necessary artifacts for on-premises environments. Lifecycle Services is the service where on-premises environments are provisioned, Business process models are created and uploaded, hotfixes are made available, support cases are entered and managed, license key serial number activations are submitted, and so on.

The Microsoft Online Services ID is required to provision and register Finance + Operations (on-premises) into entity-owned hardware and environment. See the Provisioning guide to complete the provisioning and registration process. If a Microsoft Online Services ID already exists, the Global Administrator must complete the process. If creating a Microsoft Online Services ID for the first time, the person initiating the process is the Global Administrator.

If you have an existing Microsoft Online Services trial or paid subscription, you already have a Microsoft Online Services ID that was created at the time of sign-up. Choose to sign in with this account if you want to use this same Microsoft Entra ID tenant for the on-premises environment. For details, see the [Provisioning guide](https://mbs2.microsoft.com/fileexchange/?fileID=7ddd6ddf-aa22-402a-baa1-5405ce0b1076).

After you signed in to Lifecycle Services, a project automatically provisioned for you. The Lifecycle Services project lets you deploy an on-premises environment. For more information about how to get started with your Lifecycle Services project, see [Set up on-premises projects in Lifecycle Services](../lifecycle-services/lbd-create-lcs-on-prem-project.md).
