# Platform updates for version 10.0.21 of Finance and Operations apps (October 2021)

This topic lists the features that are included in the platform updates for version 10.0.21 of Finance and Operations apps. This version has a build number of 7.0.6129 and is available on the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** August 2021
- **General availability of release (self-update):** September 2021
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** October 2021

## Known deployment issue
When deploying release 10.0.21 on IaaS, you may receive the following deployment warning:

**Warning code:** 95017

**Warning message:** Script [SetupDiagnostics] failed execution against VM

The deployment will work despite the warning, however, the following known issues may occur in Lifecycle Services (LCS):

-	On the **Environment monitoring** page, the **View detailed version information** link will not appear, so you won’t be able to see the specific versions of the modules installed in your environment. Without this data, subsequent hotfixes might fail because the process that applies hotfixes uses this data to verify that the module version prerequisites are met. Because it’s not possible to use the PEAP/Preview build in production or apply hotfixes, the impact should be minimal.
-	The **Performance Metrics** and **Index Analysis** tabs on the **Environment Monitoring** page under SQL Insights won’t display any data. All other **Environment Monitoring** features will work as intended.
-	The **Full System Diagnostics** page will not be accessible. The associated data about the status of the nightly collector runs and issues detected by its rules also won’t show up.


## Features included in this release

The following features are included in this release. Some of the listed features are still in preview, while others may already be generally available. See the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/finance-operations-crossapp-capabilities/planned-features) for official release dates for each feature.

Some features must be enabled using [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) before you can use them.

| Availability monitoring | **Enhanced self-monitoring for availability issues**<br><br>Through synthetic monitoring, Microsoft will now be able to perform continuous monitoring of API monitors to provide proactive visibility into API issues before customers find the issues themselves. This addition will allow for end-to-end coverage of specific scenarios, such as setting up probes to validate build-out deployments, monitoring a service/scenario independent of the service deployment cycle, and testing availability of dependencies. <br><br> Customers will notice that some new elements will be added to their environments, such as an Azure Active Directory application (monitoring app), a Microsoft-managed user account (monitoring app user), a security role and security duty for monitoring the app user, and an OData entity (/data/SysMonDatas). <br><br>The only action item required is that you must not delete or modify any of these elements in order for the availability monitoring to work as intended. | Not applicable | 
| Developer tools | Visual Studio 2019 is now officially supported. | [Development tools in Visual Studio](../dev-tools/development-tools-overview.md) |

### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of Finance and Operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

A deprecation notice will be added in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic 12 months before the removal of any feature from the product.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but that are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
