This topic lists the features that are included in the platform updates for version 10.0.22 of Finance and Operations apps. This version has a build number of 7.0.6164 and is available on the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** September 2021
- **General availability of release (self-update):** October 2021
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** November 2021

## Features included in this release

The following features are included in this release. Some of the listed features are still in preview, whereas others might already be generally available. For the official release date of each feature, see the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/finance-operations-crossapp-capabilities/planned-features).

| Feature area    | Feature | More information | How to enable the feature |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Client features | <p>**Open-source software update: Upgrade Moment and remove jqWidgets**</p><p>This feature upgrades Moment.js to version 2.29.1 (from 2.22.2) and removes the jQWidgets library from Finance and Operations apps. The only core controls that currently use jQWidgets are the HTML editor control and the color picker. Upgrades of both those controls to non-jqWidgets controls are available through the new HTML editor control and the new color picker control features.</p><p>**Important:** Before you enable this feature, you should test any extensible controls or custom JavaScript code, specifically controls and code that use jQWidgets or Moment application programming interfaces (APIs). This feature is targeted to become required in the April 2022 release. However, it's currently optional, to allow time for migration of affected APIs.</p> | Not applicable | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) |
| Client features | <p>**New color picker control**</p><p>This feature replaces the existing color picker control with the [Fluent ColorPicker control](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/controls/web/colorpicker) to align the experience with other Microsoft products.</p> | Not applicable | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) |
| Client features | <p>**Visual updates to the Hierarchy viewer control**</p><p>Modifications were made to the HierarchyViewer control to improve its accessibility, especially for 400-percent zoom scenarios. These modifications included restyling the control so that it's aligned with the Fluent design language, to help readability of the control at all zoom levels. | [HierarchyViewer control](../user-interface/hierarchy-viewer-control.md) | Default |

### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of Finance and Operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

A deprecation notice will be added in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic 12 months before the removal of any feature from the product.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but that are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
