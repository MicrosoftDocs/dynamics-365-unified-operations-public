# Removed or deprecated platform features

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of Finance and Operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

This list is intended to help you consider these removals and deprecations for your own planning. 

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed information about objects in Finance and Operations apps can be found in the [Technical reference reports](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep). You can compare the different versions of these reports to learn about objects that have changed or been removed in each version of Finance and Operations apps.

## Platform update 32

### Workflow request change dialog box no longer includes user selection drop-down list
|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | This was a security issue because the request for change could be sent to an unintended user. This was also a usability issue because it forced the user to determine who the workflow originator was and manually select them.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No |
| **Product areas affected**         | Workflow |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | The user selection drop-down list was removed from the request change dialog box in Platform update 32. Request change requests will be automatically sent to the originator as intended. For more information about this functionality, see [Actions in workflow approval processes](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/workflow-actions?toc=%2Fdynamics365%2Fcommerce%2Ftoc.json#request-change). |

### Embedded drill-through links are no longer supported in paginated documents rendered by the cloud-hosted service 
|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Navigation URLs embedded in documents rendered by the service may contain sensitive business data. We are removing support for embedded drill-through links in documents as a security precaution to further protect customer's data. Users will also benefit from improved performance while interactively producing documents as a result of this change.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No |
| **Product areas affected**         | Reporting |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | This feature is actively being removed from the service.<br><br>The modern client offers numerous options for producing views that include auto-generated links to assist in navigating the application. Paginated documents rendered by the service are recommended for external communications that are emailed, archived, and printed for recipients. We have improved the experience for previewing documents directly in the browser, which offers direct access to local printers. For more information, see [Preview PDF documents with an embedded viewer](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/preview-pdf-documents). |
