# Removed or deprecated platform features

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of Finance and Operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

This list is intended to help you consider these removals and deprecations for your own planning. 

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed information about objects in Finance and Operations can be found in the [Technical reference reports](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep). You can compare the different versions of these reports to learn about objects that have changed or been removed in each version of Finance and Operations apps.

## Platform update 32

### Workflow request change dialog box no longer includes user selection drop-down list
|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | This was a security issue because the request for change could be sent to an unintended user. This was also a usability issue because it forced the user to determine who the workflow originator was and manually select them.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No |
| **Product areas affected**         | Workflow |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | The user selection drop-down list was removed from the request change dialog box in Platform update 32. Request change requests will be automatically sent to the originator as intended. For more information about this functionality, see [Actions in workflow approval processes](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/workflow-actions?toc=%2Fdynamics365%2Fcommerce%2Ftoc.json#request-change). |
