## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release.

| Module or feature area | Feature name | More information | Enabled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web client | [Standardize keyboard interaction for combo box and lookup controls](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/finance-operations-crossapp-capabilities/standardize-keyboard-interaction-combo-box-lookup-controls) transitioning from preview to generally available | [Keyboard shortcuts](../../fin-ops/get-started/shortcut-keys.md) | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) |
| Web client | <p>New grid control support for grouped card lists and multi-column card lists</p><p>Pages with these types of card lists are no longer automatically reverting to use the legacy grid control. In addition, any usages of the `forceLegacyGrid()` API—because of a grouped or multi-column card list—should be safe to remove.</p> | [Grid capabilities](../../fin-ops/get-started/grid-capabilities.md) | On by default  |
| Data engine | Statement timeout | SQL queries issued from non-interactive sessions will be assigned a timeout duration. The default value is 3 hours for an indivual query. In scenarios when longer query execution is anticipated, use [queryTimeout API](/dotnet/api/microsoft.dynamics.ax.xpp.common.querytimeout) to override the default value. </p> |   On by default  |

### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of finance and operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

A deprecation notice will be added in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic 12 months before the removal of any feature from the product.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but that are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
