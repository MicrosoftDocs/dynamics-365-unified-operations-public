[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

- **Preview of release:** March 2022
- **General availability of release (self-update):** April 2022
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** May 2022

## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release.

| Feature area    | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Client  | <p>**Streamline tabbing behavior for full-page forms**</p><p>Historically in Finance and Operations apps, users would tab between all the controls in each region of a full-page form (such as the navigation bar, main form, or Action Pane). To move focus to a different region on the page, they needed to use the mouse or a dedicated keyboard shortcut. This feature removes these tabbing containers so that a user can tab through all controls on a full-page form regardless of the region they are working in and without the need for special keyboard shortcuts.<br><br>Note that the existing keyboard shortcuts will continue to function as a means for users to move quickly between the regions on a page. | [Keyboard shortcuts](../../fin-ops/get-started/shortcut-keys.md)  | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)  |
| Client  | <p>**Allow users to select and change tile sizes**</p><p>This feature allows users to change the size of tiles in a workspace to one of four available sizes. Users adding new tiles to a workspace can select the desired tile size in the configuration dialog.</p><p>Note this feature is not available for the preview release.</p> | [Personalize the user experience](../../fin-ops/get-started/personalize-user-experience.md)  | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)  |

### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) article describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of Finance and Operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

A deprecation notice will be added in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) article 12 months before the removal of any feature from the product.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but that are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
