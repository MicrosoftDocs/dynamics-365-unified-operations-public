### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of Finance and Operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

A deprecation notice will be added in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic 12 months before the removal of any feature from the product.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but that are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
