# Release schedule for proactive quality updates

This article provides the release schedule for proactive quality updates (PQUs).

The detailed schedule for each PQU train and its corresponding build app version number is published five days before the start of the PQU train. Five days before the start of release train, Microsoft sends a notification to customers who use the environments that receive the update.

Station 1 is the first release station. It consists of customers who opt in to have their sandbox environments receive the update before all other stations. More details are published after this functionality is made generally available in May 2023.

To determine when your Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Service environment is updated, find the region and the station-to-region mapping. Cross-reference the region and station-to-region mapping information with the upcoming PQU train for a service update. For customers that must plan for a PQU ahead of time, there's a high-level schedule that outlines the train schedule for every service update in 2023.

For information about the maintenance windows for each region, see [What are the planned maintenance windows by region?](../deployment/plannedmaintenance-selfservice.md#windows)

## Station-to-region mapping

| Station | Regions |
|---|---|
| Station 1 | Only for opted-in environments |
| Station 2 | Canada Central, Canada East, France Central, India Central, Norway East, Switzerland West |
| Station 3 | France South, India South, Norway West, Switzerland North, South Africa North, Australia East, UK South, UAE North, Japan East, Australia South East, South East Asia |
| Station 4 | East Asia, UK West, Japan West, Brazil South, North Europe, East US, UAE Central |
| Station 5 | West Europe, Central US, West US |
| Station 6 | DoD, Government Community Cloud, China |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. The PQU build for every train is typically published to Lifecycle Services after the change cutoff date that shows in the following high-level PQU train schedule. In this way, customers can download and self-apply the build as needed, to frontload any testing requirements. 
> 2. Standard performance test (tier-4) sandbox environments, Premium performance test (tier-5) sandbox environments, and production environments receive PQUs on weekends. If a PQU of production environment, Standard performance test (tier4) sandbox, or Premium performance test (tier5) sandbox didn't complete on the scheduled weekend then the operation gets rescheduled to the next weekend.
> 3. Standard performance test (tier-4) sandbox environments, Premium performance test (tier-5) sandbox environments opted-in for the First release program (station 1) receive updates on the following weekend of the station 1 schedule.

## High-level PQU train schedule

The following table shows the high-level train schedule. It includes a description of the service update that pertains to the train, the cutoff date after which new changes are no longer accepted, and the development duration for the PQU train.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> At least five days in advance, Microsoft updates the preceding schedule and send a notification for the set of environments that are scheduled to receive these quality updates. The preceding schedule is applicable only to environments that are notified about an upcoming update. For information on the dark hours for each region, see [What are the planned maintenance windows by region?](../deployment/plannedmaintenance-selfservice.md#windows).
>
> For each region group, or *station*, where a quality update is currently scheduled to roll out, the schedule shows a range of four days. Quality updates start with only sandbox environments. Then, as the percentage of successfully deployed sandboxes increases, deployment to production environments begins with advance notifications to customers.
> 
> Quality updates always occur in a rolling manner that enables us to target a set of environments per schedule and complete all the sets by the end of the fourth day for a station. However, this doesn't mean that an environment update spans four days. It just means that we can't predetermine which set of environments is updated on a given day within the four-day range. All updates are done during dark hours, with near-zero downtime. Updates definitively end within the dark-hour window of a given region.
