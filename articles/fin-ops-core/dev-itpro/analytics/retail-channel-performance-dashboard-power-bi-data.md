## Connect the Retail channel performance PowerBI.com solution to a Dynamics AX data source

3. If your workspace appears, click **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.
4. In **Services** section, click **Get**.
5. Scroll or search to find **Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail channel performance**, and then click **Get it now**.
6. Enter your Dynamics AX URL in the following format: `https://<tenant>.cloudax.dynamics.com` (for example, `https://YourAOSTenant.cloudax.dynamics.com`). Then click **Next** to pull data from Dynamics AX data storage into this Power BI dashboard.
7. Select **oAuth2** as the authentication method, and then click **Sign in**.

## View a list of reports
By clicking through any of the pinned tiles on the dashboard, you can navigate the following list of reports that provide insights into retail channel performance:

- Geographical sales distribution
- Category sales performance
- Sales summary by Tender type or payment method
- Employee monthly performance
- Store monthly performance

## Modify an existing report in the PowerBI.com solution to make it self-authored
Here's an example that shows how easy it is to modify an existing report in the PowerBI.com solution to make it self-authored. In this example, we will modify an existing report that is named **Category & product performance** by adding **Category level 1** to the **Total amount by Month/Year** chart on that report.

1. Click the **CategoryProductPerformance** tab at the bottom of the window to open the **Category & product performance** report, and then click **Edit report**.

    [![Edit report.](./media/editreport-1024x580.png)](./media/editreport.png)

2. Select the chart that is named **Total amount by Month/Year**. Then, on the right side of the window, in the **Fields** pane, expand the **Default Retail Product Category Hierarchy** node.

    [![Default Retail Product Category Hierarchy node for the Total amount by Month/Year chart.](./media/editreportstep2-1024x624.png)](./media/editreportstep2.png)

3. In the list of category levels for this hierarchy, select **Category Level 1**. The name of the chart that you selected this attribute for changes to **Total amount by Month/Year and Category level 1**, and the chart now shows the share of sales in each category for each month.

4. Finally, try to change the visualization itself. Select the **Total amount by Month/Year and Category level 1** chart, and then, in the **Visualizations** pane, click **Area chart** or **Stacked area chart**, and see the effect.

## Get a glimpse of the actual data model
The data model that is included in the PowerBI.com solution for the Dynamics AX data entities and aggregated data entities lets you slice and dice across various measures by using different dimensions.
