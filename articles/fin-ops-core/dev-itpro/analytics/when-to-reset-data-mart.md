# When to reset a data mart

Resetting a data mart can be time consuming. Depending on the circumstances, this action may not be the solution that's needed. This topic lists the circumstances that might be improved by resetting a data mart, as well as circumstances in which resetting your data mart is unlikely to help.  

## When do you need to do a data mart reset?
Consider the following questions before resetting a data mart. Answering yes to one or more questions might indicate that your organization can benefit by resetting the data mart.

- The application database was restored, but the data mart database was not restored.
- You see incorrect data for an accounting period, which isn't the result of an issue with the report design.
- You see incorrect data for an accounting period, and records are listed under Integration attempts on the **Integration status** page in Report Designer (start the Report Designer and select **Tools > Integration status**).
- You've opened a support incident and a support engineer has instructed you to reset the data mart as part of a troubleshooting step.
 
## When it's not appropriate to reset a data mart?
There are some circumstances when we don't recommend resetting a data mart. These include the following. 

- Anytime the reason isn’t listed in this topic.
- You're experiencing performance issues that are associated with a data sync. In this circumstance, resetting the data mart probably won't help.
- If you have a recurring reset pattern due to any of the following reasons: 
  - **Missing data** - First, eliminate report design issues and data sync timing issues, for example, you observe that the fact map hasn’t run since missing data was posted.
  - **Stuck integration state** - If the integration is slow or seems stuck, resetting the data mart is unlikely to resolve the issue.
  - **Attempts to reset have been unsuccessful** - If a number of attempts to complete a reset have been made, and have been unsuccessful because of missing data, we recommend opening a support incident and working with a support engineer to analyze your situation before attempting to reset the data mart again.
  - **Stale records** - Stale records by themselves don't necessarily justify resetting the data mart. If you have a large data set, the reset process will take some time to run, but is unlikely to result in improvement.
 
## What a data mart reset does not do  
- A reset will only start when existing tasks are complete. This ensures that old data is not inserted. At this point you may see a message such as, “The data mart reset was unable to be processed because of an active task. Please try again later.”
- The reset will disable the integration tasks and delete all the data mart data. The integration is re-enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The following points specify two things that resetting a data mart will *not* do. <br>
> - Resets do not clear report designs. <br>
> - Resets do not clear company data or user data unless selected.
