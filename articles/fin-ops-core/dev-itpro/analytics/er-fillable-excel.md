# Design a configuration for generating documents in Excel format

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can design an [Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) format configuration that has an ER [format component](general-electronic-reporting.md#FormatComponentOutbound) that you can configure to generate an outbound document in a Microsoft Excel workbook format. Specific ER format components must be used for this purpose.

To learn more about this feature, follow the steps in the topic, [Design a configuration for generating reports in OPENXML format](tasks/er-design-reports-openxml-2016-11.md).

## Add a new ER format

When you add a new ER format configuration to generate an outbound document in an Excel workbook format, you must either select the **Excel** value for the **Format type** attribute of the format or leave the **Format type** attribute blank.

- If you select **Excel**, you can configure the format to generate an outbound document only in Excel format.
- If you leave the attribute blank, you can configure the format to generate an outbound document in any format that is supported by the ER framework.

To configure the ER format component of the configuration, select **Designer** on the Action Pane, and open the ER format component for editing in the ER Operation designer.

## Excel file component

### Manual entry

You must add an **Excel\\File** component to the configured ER format to generate an outbound document in Excel format.

![Excel\File component](./media/er-excel-format-add-file-component.png)

To specify the layout of the outbound document, attach an Excel workbook that has the .xlsx extension to the **Excel\\File** component as the template for outbound documents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you manually attach a template, you must use a [document type](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/configure-document-management#configure-document-types) that has been configured for that purpose in the [ER parameters](electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md#parameters-to-manage-documents).

![Adding an attachment to the Excel\File component](./media/er-excel-format-add-file-component2.png)

To specify how the attached template will be filled in when you run the configured ER format, you must add nested **Sheet**, **Range**, and **Cell** components to the **Excel\\File** component. Each nested component must be associated with an Excel named item.

### Template import

You can select **Import from Excel** on the **Import** tab of the Action Pane to import a new template into a blank ER format. In this example, an **Excel\\File** component will be created automatically, and the imported template will be attached to it. All required ER components will also be created automatically, based on the list of Excel named items that are discovered.

![Selecting Import from Excel](./media/er-excel-format-import-template.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to create the optional **Sheet** element in the editable ER format, set the **Create Excel Sheet format element** option to **Yes**.

## Sheet component

The **Sheet** component indicates a worksheet of the attached Excel workbook that must be filled in. The name of the worksheet in an Excel template is defined in the **Sheet** property of this component.

> [!NOTE]
> This component is optional for Excel workbooks that contain a single worksheet.

On the **Mapping** tab of the ER Operation designer, you can configure the **Enabled** property for a **Sheet** component to specify whether the component must be put in a generated document:

- If an expression of the **Enabled** property is configured to return **True** at runtime, or if no expression is configured at all, the appropriate worksheet will be put in the generated document.
- If an expression of the **Enabled** property is configured to return **False** at runtime, the generated document won't contain a worksheet.

![Example of a Sheet component](./media/er-excel-format-sheet-component.png)

## Range component

The **Range** component indicates an Excel range that must be controlled by this ER component. The name of the range is defined in the **Excel range** property of this component.

The **Replication direction** property specifies whether and how the range will be repeated in a generated document:

- If the **Replication direction** property is set to **No replication**, the appropriate Excel range won't be repeated in the generated document.
- If the **Replication direction** property is set to **Vertical**, the appropriate Excel range will be repeated in the generated document. Every replicated range is put below the original range in an Excel template. The number of repetitions is defined by the number of records in a data source of the **Record list** type that is bound to this ER component.
- If the **Replication direction** property is set to **Horizontal**, the appropriate Excel range will be repeated in the generated document. Every replicated range is put to the right of the original range in an Excel template. The number of repetitions is defined by the number of records in a data source of the **Record list** type that is bound to this ER component.

To learn more about horizontal replication, follow the steps in [Use horizontally expandable ranges to dynamically add columns in Excel reports](tasks/er-horizontal-1.md).

The **Range** component can have other nested ER components that are used to enter values in the appropriate Excel named ranges.

- If any component of the **Text** group is used to enter values, the value is entered in an Excel range as a text value.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use this pattern to format entered values based on the locale that is defined in the application.

- If the **Cell** component of the **Excel** group is used to enter values, the value is entered in an Excel range as a value of the data type that is defined by the binding of that **Cell** component (for example, **String**, **Real**, or **Integer**).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use this pattern to enable the Excel application to format entered values based on the locale of the local computer that opens the outbound document.

On the **Mapping** tab of the ER Operation designer, you can configure the **Enabled** property for a **Range** component to specify whether the component must be put in a generated document:

- If an expression of the **Enabled** property is configured to return **True** at runtime, or if no expression is configured at all, the appropriate range will be filled in in the generated document.
- If an expression of the **Enabled** property is configured to return **False** at runtime, and if this range doesn't represent the entire rows or columns, the appropriate range won't be filled in in the generated document.
- If an expression of the **Enabled** property is configured to return **False** at runtime, and this range represents the entire rows or columns, the generated document will contain those rows and columns as hidden rows and columns.

## Cell component

The **Cell** component is used to fill in Excel named cells, shapes, and pictures. To indicate an Excel named object that must be filled in by a **Cell** ER component, you must specify the name of that object in the **Excel range** property of the **Cell** component.

On the **Mapping** tab of the ER Operation designer, you can configure the **Enabled** property for a **Cell** component to specify whether the object must be filled in in a generated document:

- If an expression of the **Enabled** property is configured to return **True** at runtime, or if no expression is configured at all, the appropriate object will be filled in in the generated document. The binding of this **Cell** component specifies a value that is put in the appropriate object.
- If an expression of the **Enabled** property is configured to return **False** at runtime, the appropriate object won't be filled in in the generated document.

When a **Cell** component is configured to enter a value in a cell, it can be bound with a data source that returns the value of a primitive data type (for example, **String**, **Real**, or **Integer**). In this case, the value is entered in the cell as a value of the same data type.

When a **Cell** component is configured to enter a value in an Excel shape, it can be bound with a data source that returns a value of a primitive data type (for example, **String**, **Real**, or **Integer**). In this case, the value is entered in the Excel shape as the text of that shape. For values of data types that aren't **String**, the conversion to text is done automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure a **Cell** component to fill in a shape only in cases where a shape text property is supported.

When a **Cell** component is configured to enter a value in an Excel picture, it can be bound with a data source that returns a value of the **Container** data type that represents an image in binary format. In this case, the value is entered in the Excel picture as an image.

> [!NOTE]
> Every Excel picture and shape is considered to be anchored by its upper-left corner to a specific Excel cell or range. If you want to replicate an Excel picture or shape, you must configure the cell or range that it's anchored to as a replicated cell or range.

To learn more about how to embed images and shapes, see [Embed images and shapes in documents that you generate by using ER](electronic-reporting-embed-images-shapes.md).

## Page break component

The **PageBreak** component forces Excel to start a new page. This component isn't required when you want to use Excel's default paging, but you should use it when you want Excel to follow your ER format to structure paging.

## Edit an added ER format

### Update a template

You can select **Update from Excel** on the **Import** tab of the Action Pane to import an updated template into an editable ER format. During this process, a template of the selected **Excel\\File** component will be replaced by a new template. The content of the editable ER format will be synced with the content of the updated ER template.

- A new ER format component will automatically be created for every Excel name if the ER format component isn't found in the editable format.
- Every ER format component will be deleted from the editable ER format if the appropriate Excel name isn't found for it.

> [!NOTE]
> Set the **Create Excel Sheet format element** option to **Yes** if you want to create the optional **Sheet** element in the editable ER format.
>
> If the editable ER format originally contained **Sheet** elements, we recommend that you set the **Create Excel Sheet format element** option to **Yes** when you import an updated template. Otherwise, all nested elements of the original **Sheet** element will be created from scratch. Therefore, all bindings of the re-created format elements will be lost in the updated ER format.

To learn more about this feature, follow the steps in [Modify Electronic reporting formats by reapplying Excel templates](modify-electronic-reporting-format-reapply-excel-template.md).

## Validate an ER format

When you validate an ER format that can be edited, a consistency check is done to make sure that the Excel name is present in the Excel template that is currently used. You will be notified about any inconsistencies. For some inconsistencies, the option to automatically fix issues will be offered.
