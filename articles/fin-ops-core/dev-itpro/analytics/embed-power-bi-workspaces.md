# Analytical Workspaces (using Power BI Embedded)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics finance and operations apps now deliver rich, interactive reports that seamlessly integrate into application workspaces. By using graphics and visuals supported by Power BI, workspaces provide a highly visual, yet interactive experiences for users.

## Overview

Workspaces in the application provide an overview of business processes or business units. With rich workspaces, users get a bird's-eye view of the state of business before diving into details and taking action. Workspaces contain visuals, count tiles, and KPIs as well as quick links to reports and pages. Within a workspace, all controls are tightly integrated to provide a highly productive and engaging work environment to the user. Power BI Embedded is a Microsoft Azure service that enables ISVs and app developers to surface Power BI data experiences within their applications. With Power BI Embedded, developers can deliver always-up-to-date views with Direct Query. To learn more about how the Power BI Embedded service integrates with the application, see [Power BI Embedded integration](power-bi-embedded-integration.md).

## Power BI in workspaces

The application now delivers interactive reports that seamlessly integrate into application workspaces. By using rich infographics and visuals supported by Power BI (including the large number of controls provided by third parties), workspaces provide a highly visual, yet interactive experience for users. Using infographics in the overview page, users get a quick glance of the state of the business. They can interact with data by simply clicking or touching visuals on the page. They can see the cause and effect, perform simple what-if operations without leaving the workspace. With interactive visuals, your users have fun exploring data and discovering hidden trends.
