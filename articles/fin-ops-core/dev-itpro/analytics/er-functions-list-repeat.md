# REPEAT ER function

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include [banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

The `REPEAT` function builds a record that contains the field that has a value that matches the specified input. It then returns a new *Record list* of a record that is repeated a specified number of times.

## Syntax

```vb
REPEAT (item, number)
```

## Arguments

`item`: Any supported [primitive](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md) or [composite](er-formula-supported-data-types-composite.md) data type

The value to repeat.

`number`: *Integer*

The number of repeats.

## Return values

*Record list*

The resulting list of records.

## Usage notes

The list of repeated records that is returned exposes the following fields:

- The specified value (`Item` field)
- The current record index (`Number` field)

> [!NOTE]
> Because one-based numbering is used for this function, the `Number` field has the value **1** for the first record of the resulting list.

You can use this function to multiply existing data so that you can do performance and volume testing of [Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) solutions by using the [Regression suite automation tool (RSAT)](../perf-test/rsat/rsat-overview.md).

## Example

You want to generate a document in XML format that must contain as many `Party` XML elements as you specify in a data entry field in the dialog box at runtime, before the execution of an ER format begins.

The following illustration shows the ER [format](er-overview-components.md#format-component). In this format, the single `Party` XML element is added to expose the properties of a single party.

The next illustration shows the following configured data sources:

- The `Party` data source that represents a single party. The `Party.Value` field is used to expose a single text value.
- The `NumberOfRepeats` [data source](er-user-input-parameter-data-sources.md) that is used to offer a data entry field in the dialog box at runtime, so that you can specify the number of parties that should be entered in the generated document.
- The `Party2` data source that repeats the `Party` record the number of  times that you specified in the `NumberOfRepeats` data source.

The next illustration shows data bindings of the editable ER format that are created to generate output in XML format. This output presents individual parties as enumerated nodes.

The following illustration shows the result when the designed format is run and the value of the `NumberOfRepeats` data source is specified as **5**.
