# Set up the parameters of an ER format per legal entity

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Prerequisites

To complete these steps, you must first complete the steps in [Configure ER formats to use parameters that are specified per legal entity](er-app-specific-parameters-configure-format.md).

To complete the examples in this article, you must have access to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance for one of the following roles:

- Electronic reporting developer
- Electronic reporting functional consultant
- System administrator

## Import ER configurations
To import ER configurations, follow these steps: 

1. Sign in to your environment.
2. On the default dashboard, select **Electronic reporting**.
3. Select **Reporting configurations**.
4. In the current instance of Finance, import the configurations that you exported from Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) while you were completing the steps in [Configure ER formats to use parameters that are specified per legal entity](er-app-specific-parameters-configure-format.md). Follow these steps for each [Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) configuration in the following order: data model, model mapping, and formats.

    1. Select **Exchange \> Load from XML file**.
    2. Select **Browse** to select the file for the required ER configuration in XML format.
    3. Select **OK**.

    The following illustration shows the configurations that you must have when you've finished.

    ![ER configurations page.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-ImportedConfigurations.PNG)

## Set up parameters for the DEMF company

You can use the ER framework to set up application-specific parameters for an ER format.

1. Select the **DEMF** legal entity.
2. In the configurations tree, select the **Format to learn how to lookup LE data** format.
3. On the Action Pane, on the **Configurations** tab, in the **Application specific parameters** group, select **Setup**.

    ![ER application-specific parameters page to set up parameters.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm.PNG)

    On the **Application specific parameters** page, you can configure the rules for the **Selector** data source of the **Format to learn how to lookup LE data** format.

    If the base ER format will contain several data sources of the **Lookup** type, you must select the desired data source on the **Lookups** FastTab before you can start to configure the set of rules for the data source.

    For each data source, you can configure separate rules for each version of the selected ER format.

    The whole set of rules for all lookup data sources that are available in the selected version of the base ER format makes up the application-specific parameters for the ER format.

4. Select version **1.1.1** of the ER format.
5. On the **Conditions** FastTab, select **Add**.
6. In the **Code** field of the new record, select the drop-down arrow to open the lookup.

    The lookup presents the list of tax codes for selection. This list is returned by the **Model.Data.Tax** data source that has been configured in the base ER format. Because this data source contains the **Name** field, the name of each tax code appears in the lookup.

    ![Code field look up on the ER application-specific parameters page.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm-CodeFldPicker.PNG)

7. Select the **VAT19** tax code.
8. In the **Lookup result** field of the new record, select the drop-down arrow to open the lookup. The lookup presents the list of values for the TaxationLevel format enumeration for selection.

    Note that if you selected German as the preferred language for the user that you're signed in as, the labels of the values in the lookup will be in German, provided that they have been translated in the base ER format. Additionally, if the label of a lookup data source has been translated, that label will appear in the user's preferred language on the **Lookups** tab.

    ![Lookup field translated into German on the ER application-specific parameters page.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm-LookupFldPicker.PNG)

9. Select the **Regular taxation** value.

    By adding this record, you define the following rule: When the **Selector** lookup data source is requested, and the **VAT19** tax code is passed as an argument, **Regular taxation** will be returned as the requested taxation level.

10. Select **Add**, and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Code** field, select the **InVAT19** tax code.
    2. In the **Lookup result** field, select the **Regular taxation** value.

11. Select **Add**, and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Code** field, select the **VAT7** tax code.
    2. In the **Lookup result** field, select the **Reduced taxation** value.

12. Select **Add** , and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Code** field, select the **InVAT7** tax code.
    2. In the **Lookup result** field, select the **Reduced taxation** value.

13. Select **Add**, and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Code** field, select the **THIRD** tax code.
    2. In the **Lookup result** field, select the **No taxation** value.

14. Select **Add**, and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Code** field, select the **InVAT0** tax code.
    2. In the **Lookup result** field, select the **No taxation** value.

15. Select **Add**, and then follow these steps:

    1. In the **Code** field, select the **\*Not blank\*** option.
    2. In the **Lookup result** field, select the **Other** value.

    By adding this last record, you define the following rule: When the tax code that is passed as an argument doesn't satisfy any of the previous rules, the lookup data source will return **Other** as the requested taxation level.

    ![Last record added on the ER application-specific parameters page.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm-RulesSet.PNG)

16. In the **State** field, select **Completed**.

    When you run an ER format version that has a status of either **Completed** or **Shared**, this set of rules must be in the **Completed** state. Otherwise, execution of the base ER format will be interrupted when the format tries to load data from this set of rules while the **Selector** lookup data source is being run.

    When you run an ER format version that has a status of **Draft**, the base ER format can access this set of rules, regardless of its state.

17. Select **Save**.
18. Close the **Application specific parameters** page.

## Run the ER format in the DEMF company
To run the ER format in the DEMF company, follow these steps: 

1. In the configurations tree, select the **Format to learn how to lookup LE data** format.
2. On the Action Pane, select **Run**.
3. In the dialog box that appears, select **OK**.
4. Download the statement that is generated and store it locally.

    In the generated statement, notice that the summary of the **InVAT7** tax code is on the **Reduced** level, and the summaries of the **VAT19** and **InVA19** tax codes is on the **Regular** level. This behavior is determined by the configuration in the legal entityâ€“dependent set of rules.

5. Go to **Tax \> Indirect taxes \> Sales tax \> Sales tax codes**.
6. Select the **InVAT7** tax code.
7. On the Action Pane, on the **Sales tax code** tab, in the **Inquiries** group, select **Posted sales tax** to view information about the tax value and applied tax rate per tax code.

    ![Posted sales tax page.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-Statement.PNG)

8. Close the **Posted sales tax** page.

## Set up parameters for the USMF company
To set up parameters for the USMF company, complete the following steps: 

1. Select the **USMF** legal entity.
2. Go to **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Configurations**.
3. In the configurations tree, expand the **Model to learn parameterized calls** item, expand the **Format to learn parameterized calls** item, and select the **Format to learn how to lookup LE data** format.
4. On the Action Pane, on the **Configurations** tab, in the **Application specific parameters** group, select **Setup**.
5. Select version **1.1.1** of the selected ER format.
6. On the **Conditions** FastTab, select **Add**.
7. In the **Code** field of the new record, select the drop-down arrow to open the lookup.

    The lookup now presents the list of tax codes for the **USMF** company tax for selection.

    ![Tax codes for the USMF company tax.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm-CodeFldPicker2.PNG)

8. Select the **EXEMPT** tax code.
9. In the **Lookup resul**t field of the new record, select the **No taxation** value.
10. Select **Add**.
11. In the **Code** field of the new record, select the **\*Not blank\*** option.
12. In the **Lookup result** field of the new record, select the **Regular taxation** value.
13. In the **State** field, select **Completed**.
14. Select **Save**.

    ![ER application specific parameters page.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm-RulesSet2.PNG)

15. Close the **Application specific parameters** page.

## Run the ER format in the USMF company
To run the ER format in the USMF company, complete the following steps:

1. In the configurations tree, select the **Format to learn how to lookup LE data** format.
2. On the Action Pane, select **Run**.
3. In the dialog box that appears, select **OK**.
4. Download the statement that is generated and store it locally.

    In the generated statement, notice that you've now reused the same ER format for a different legal entity, but without making any adjustments to the ER format.

## Reuse legal entityâ€“dependent parameters

### Duplicate existing parameters

#### Export parameters
To export parameters, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Workspaces \> Electronic reporting**.
2. Select **Reporting configurations**.
3. In the configurations tree, select the **Format to learn how to lookup LE data** format.
4. On the Action Pane, on the **Configurations** tab, in the **Application specific parameters** group, select **Setup**.
5. Select version **1.1.1** of the ER format.
6. On the Action Pane, select **Export**.
7. Download the file that is generated and store it locally.

    The configured set of application-specific parameters has now been exported as an XML file.

#### Import parameters
To import parameters, complete the following steps:

1. Select version **1.1.2** of the ER format.
2. On the Action Pane, select **Import**.
3. Select **Yes** to confirm that you want to override the existing application-specific parameters for this format version.
4. Select **Browse** to find the file that contains the exported application-specific parameters for version **1.1.1**.
5. Select **OK**.

    Version **1.1.2** of the ER format now has the same application-specific parameters that you originally configured for version **1.1.1**.

##### Applicability considerations

The application-specific parameters of an ER format are legal entityâ€“dependent. To reuse the application-specific parameters that were configured for one legal entity in a different legal entity, you must export them while you're signed in to the first legal entity. Then import them after you sign in to the other legal entity.

You can also use this export-import approach to transfer ER formatâ€“related application-specific parameters that were originally configured in one instance of Finance to another instance of Finance.

If you configure application-specific parameters for one version of an ER format and then import a later version of the same format into the current Finance instance, the existing application-specific parameters won't be applied to the imported version unless you use the **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature. For more information, see the [Reuse existing parameters](#reuse-existing-parameters) section later in this article.

When you select a file for import, the structure of the application-specific parameters in that file is compared with the structure of the corresponding data sources of the **Lookup** type in the ER format that is selected for import. By default, the import is completed only if the structure of each application-specific parameter matches the structure of the corresponding data source in the ER format that is selected for import. If the structures don't match, a warning message informs you that the import can't be completed. If you force the import, the existing application-specific parameters for the selected ER format will be cleaned up, and you must set them up from the beginning.


As of Finance version 10.0.24, you can change the default behavior and avoid receiving a warning message by enabling the **Align ER application specific parameters while importing** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled, if the structure of application-specific parameters that you're importing differs from the structure of the corresponding data sources in the target ER format that is selected for import, the import will succeed in the following cases:

- The structure of the target ER format has been changed by adding new condition columns to any existing data sources of the **Lookup** type. When the import is completed, the application-specific parameters are updated. In all the imported records of application-specific parameters, the values in every added condition column are initialized with the default value for the [data type](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md) of that column.
- The structure of the target ER format has been changed by removing some condition columns from any existing data sources of the **Lookup** type. When the import is completed, the application-specific parameters are updated. In all the imported records of application-specific parameters, the values in every removed condition column are deleted.
- The structure of the target ER format has been changed by adding new data sources of the **Lookup** type. When the import is completed, the added lookups are appended to the application-specific parameters.
- The structure of the target ER format has been changed by removing some of the existing data sources of the **Lookup** type. When the import is completed, all artifacts that are related to the data sources of the **Lookup** type that were removed from the target ER format are deleted from the imported application-specific parameters.

When the import is completed, in addition to the changes that were just described, the state of the imported application-specific parameters is changed to **In progress**. A warning message informs you that the automatically adjusted application-specific parameters must be manually edited.

#### Replicate parameters

As of Finance version 10.0.27, you can copy the parameters that you configured in one company to other companies at the same time.

To copy parameters, complete the following steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. Select **Reporting configurations**.
3. In the configurations tree, select the **Format to learn how to lookup LE data** format.
4. On the Action Pane, on the **Configurations** tab, in the **Application specific parameters** group, select **Setup**.
5. Select version **1.1.1** of the ER format.
6. On the Action Pane, select **Replicate**.
7. In the **Replicate** dialog box, on the **Companies** tab, select the companies that you want to copy parameters to.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The list of target companies is offered only to users who are assigned a security [role](../sysadmin/role-based-security.md#security-roles) that is configured to grant access to all organizations.

8. Select **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The confirmation dialog box informs you if some target companies contain previously configured parameters for the selected version of an ER format. Select **Yes** to override the parameters by copying them from the current company.

    The configured set of application-specific parameters is now copied to the selected companies.

### Reuse existing parameters

As of Finance version 10.0.23, you can reuse application-specific parameters that have been configured for one version of an ER format when you run a higher version of the same format. To reuse existing parameters, enable the **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled and you run one version of an ER format that is trying to read application-specific parameters, ER will try to find application-specific parameters that have been configured for the running version of the format. If they aren't available, ER will try to find them for the nearest lower version of the format.

> [!NOTE]
> You can reuse application-specific parameters only in the scope of the current legal entity.
>
> An error is displayed at runtime when you run a higher version of an ER format that is trying to reuse application-specific parameters that have been configured for a lower version of the same format and the structure of at least one data source of the **Lookup** type in the higher format version has changed.

## Relationship between application-specific parameters and an ER format

The relationship between an ER format and its application-specific parameters is established by the ER format's instance-independent unique identification code. Therefore, when you remove an ER format from Finance, the application-specific parameters that are configured for the ER format are kept in the current instance of Finance. They can be accessed when the base ER format is reimported into this instance of Finance.

## Access application-specific parameters by using the ER framework

In the preceding example, you have accessed application-specific parameters of an ER format by using the ER framework. This approach doesn't let you restrict access to the application-specific parameters of a specific ER format. If you must apply such restrictions, follow these steps. 

1. Either reuse an existing **ERSolutionAppSpecificParametersDesigner** menu item, or implement your own **ERSolutionAppSpecificParametersDesigner** menu item.

    ![Menu item display of ERSolutionAppSpecificParametersDesigner.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm-Access1.PNG)

2. Follow one of these steps:

    1. Create a new menu item button, and link it to the corresponding record from the **ERSolutionTable** table by setting its **Data Source** property to **ERSolutionTable**.

        ![Display of new menu item settings.](./media/GER-AppSpecParms-LookupForm-Access2.PNG)

    2. Create a simple button, and override the **Clicked** method as shown in the following example.

        By using this approach, you can specify a unique solution ID (defined via the **GUID** value) to allow access to the application-specific parameters of only a specific ER format and descendant copies that have been derived from it.
        
        ```xpp
        public void clicked()
            {
                super();

                ERSolutionTable solutionTableRecord = ERSolutionTable::findByGUID(str2Guid('ADACCB2F-EFD1-4C90-877D-7E1E5D1AEE92'));

                Args args = new Args();
                args.record(solutionTableRecord);
                args.caller(this);

                new MenuFunction(menuItemDisplayStr(ERSolutionAppSpecificParametersDesigner), MenuItemType::Display)
                    .run(args);
            }
        ```
