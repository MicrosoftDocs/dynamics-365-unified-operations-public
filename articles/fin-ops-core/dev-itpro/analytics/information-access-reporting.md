# Information access and reporting

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains the various reporting options available as part of the platform.

## Why information access is important

Information access is an essential part of an ERP solution and represents a significant portion of the user engagement with the system. Consider the numerous methods of capturing information related to daily activities and the level of investments required to manage the data. Employees depend on logical interpretations of massive amounts of data to stay on top of their daily tasks. Out of the box the platform provides a collection of reporting solutions to address the various information access needs of an ERP solution. In an increasingly competitive environment, mergers and acquisitions seem to occur as often as the change in seasons. More than ever before, businesses today are finding ways to expand their global reach to attract more customers. To be successful, they must adapt legacy solutions used to communicate with customers and prepare for the enforcement of regional regulatory requirements associated with new markets. Beyond the primitive functions provided by Microsoft Azure – compute, networking, storage, and authentication – the platform provides tools to manage resources for organizations that span in size from small businesses to global enterprise conglomerates. These tools are designed with flexibility in mind, to accommodate a dynamic world of business.

## What is a "report" in the application?
A *report* can be defined simply as a structured presentation of data. Under ideal circumstances, reports materialize data in such a way that it allows the user to make informed decisions. The application supports a broad spectrum of information access scenarios: cross company all-up financial reporting; analytical dashboards and tiles; electronically transferable funds; customer sales invoices; checks and tax documents; and many more. Examples of integrated report scenarios that involve the consumption of business data include:

- **Native controls** including list pages, grid controls, and chart visualizations.
- **Dashboards and workspaces** containing predefined and personalized views.
- **Financial reporting** providing all-up views across legal entities.
- **Structured documents** distributed internally to employees or externally to customers and vendors.

Although each of these scenarios at its core involves the presentation of structured business data, the process of accessing these reports and how the results are subsequently consumed varies greatly. Flexibility in the user tooling is essential for scenarios that involve data exploration. By contrast, layout precision is required for compliance with most regulatory documents. Given the diversity of information access scenarios it's understandable that not all reports are created equal. This article is intended to help familiarize you with the various reporting options available as part of the platform.

## Common myths of reporting
To become a proficient *report* *maker*, it's often useful to let go of past inhibitions. The following section seeks to rebuke three common myths about reporting.

- **Myth \#1: Operational reports require "real-time" data** To the contrary, there are relatively few reporting scenarios that require *real-time* results. And, in the grand scheme of things, taking a critical stance on a request for *real-time* views is recommended given the high development costs and potential heavy burden these solutions may incur on production environments.
- **Myth \#2: The best tool is the one the developer is most comfortable using** Consider a customer request for a report that allows them to monitor company's assets. In the past, a developer would build a static report displaying a list of inventory items with complex calculations relying entirely on the user to provide filters to sufficiently reduce the result set. This solution may function perfectly in developer environments with a reduced data set. However, this approach is prone to unnecessarily consume significant amounts of compute resources when utilized in production.
- **Myth \#3: Developers are good at creating visually compelling designs** In reality, developers are the often the worst offenders when it comes to producing elegant design layouts that will appeal to the customer's aesthetic preferences. When it comes to analytical reports you're better off empowering users to both explore the data directly and share personalized views.

## Understanding report requirements
The best reporting solutions are designed with the expertise, daily functions, and information access needs of the target user in mind. The platform offers several tools designed to meet the functional requirements which are common across various reporting experiences. Without question, selecting the right tool that most effectively addresses the *need* requires a clear understanding of the customer experience. You can drastically increase your chances of delivering a complete and robust solution that fully satisfies customer requirements by simply asking the right questions. Here are some leading questions to ask when evaluating customer requirements for reporting solutions:

- **Get to know the user**

    - What is the proficiency of the target persona? Are they familiar with analytical tools like Microsoft Excel?
    - Does the user require a guided parameter experience to refine the dataset?
    - How frequently will the report be accessed?

- **Familiarize yourself with the data**

    - Are they looking for transactional, analytical, and/or predictive information?
    - Does the shape of the data change and if so, how often?
    - Will the report include data from external sources?

- **Determine how the results will be used**

    - Are you going to explore the data to gain insights?
    - How will the results be shared with others?
    - Is there a fixed document structure for the target output?

It's understandable that customers *want* a solution that aligns with the existing processes they are comfortable using. However, there's a lot you can learn through these leading questions used to discover what the customer actually *needs* to be successful in their task. Delight your customers by providing them with solutions that empower them to be more productive.

## Reporting experiences
Information access scenarios supported in applications can be broken down into five distinct reporting experiences. Specialized tools are provided to meet the complex and diverse reporting needs of various functions throughout the organization.

- **Operational views** – Designed to address the specific needs of a given business persona.
- **Business documents** – Static documents used to capture and exchange processed business data.
- **Analytical tools and visualizations** – Personalized presentations of logical calculations that allow the user to explore their data.
- **Electronic reporting** – Tool used to configure formats for electronic documents.
- **Financial reporting** – Designed to provide in-depth accounting management tools based on standard views of financial activities across legal entities.

## Operational views
Operational views represent an essential part of the average employee's daily life. As important as a brush is to a painter, operational views are used to empower people to be productive. These views contain logical presentations of data to help the user discover patterns, highlight anomalies, and act on the most important tasks. Targeted experiences are used to satisfy the unique information access requirements for a given persona. These views provide actionable controls that help to maximize efficiency for common user actions. Learn more about constructing custom operational workspaces in [Build operational workspaces](../user-interface/build-workspaces.md). Example applications of operational views include controller operations, production floor management, and customer collections monitoring.

## Business documents
These reporting solutions are often used to capture and communicate the details of business transactions. As such, this requires a reporting solution capable of producing physical manifestations of business data using existing devices like network printers. Learn more about the enhancements to the Document reporting service in [Document Reporting Services](document-reporting-services.md). Example applications of business documents include sales invoice, customer statements, and checks.
