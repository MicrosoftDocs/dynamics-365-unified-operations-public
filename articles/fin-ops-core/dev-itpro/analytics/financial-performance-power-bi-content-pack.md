# Financial performance PowerBI.com solution

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This PowerBI.com solution has been deprecated as documented in [Removed or deprecated features for Finance and Operations](../migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md#power-bi-content-packs-available-on-appsource).

This topic describes the **Financial performance** PowerBI.com solution. It describes the dashboard and reports that are included, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the solution.

## Main account setup
Because organizations want liabilities and revenue amounts to appear as positive amounts on reports, the setup of the main accounts is important. For these main accounts to appear as positive amounts, the main account type must be set to **Liability** or **Revenue**. When these account types are used, reporting through Power BI will reverse the signs and show the amounts as positive.

## Dashboard and reports that are included in the PowerBI.com solution
The dashboard contains summarized tiles of data that are based on underlying reports. Each tile contains summarized information for the current year across all companies in an organization. Here are some of the tiles:

- Cash
- Total Revenue this year
- Total Expenses this year
- Net Income this year
- Quick Ratio
- Total Expenses this year by account category
- Current Ratio
- Debt to Total Assets
- Actual vs Forecasted Revenue
- Billed Revenue this Year
- Operating expenses Ratio this year
- Profit Margin this year
- Actual vs Budget Expenses – All companies

Each tile is backed by a supporting report. These reports contain both charts and tables that provide more information. The following table describes the reports.

| Report                      | Information that the report contains |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Cash Analysis               | Cash by legal entity, cash by quarter, total cash, and cash by account<blockquote>[!NOTE] The cash by quarter information doesn't include beginning balances in the total for the first quarter. It shows the total of new transactions that are posted in each quarter.</blockquote> |

It shows the total of new transactions that are posted to Accounts receivable.</blockquote> |

The charts and tiles on all these reports can be filtered and pinned to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure a Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).

## Understanding the data model and entities
The following entities were used as the basis of the **Financial performance** PowerBI.com solution:

**Aggregate data entities**

- **GeneralLedgerActivities** – This entity aggregates general ledger balances by account category.
- **BudgetActivities** – This entity aggregates budget balances by account category.

**Data entities**

- FiscalCalendars
- MainAccounts
- LegalEntities
- Ledgers
- ChartofAccounts

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model. The calculated measures are used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content. By default, the content brings in data for the last three years and one future year. To include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can modify the [Microsoft Excel workbook](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/global/AX/downloads/reports/msdaxfinpercontentpowerbi). This workbook is the default data model that was used to create the content.
