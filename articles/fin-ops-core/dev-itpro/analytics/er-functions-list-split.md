[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The `SPLIT` function splits the specified input string into substrings and returns the result as a new *Record list* value.

## Syntax 1

```
SPLIT (input, length)
```

This syntax is used to split the specified input string into substrings, each of which has the specified length.

## Syntax 2

```
SPLIT (input, delimiter)
```

This syntax is used to split the specified input string into substrings, based on the specified delimiter.

## Arguments

`input`: *String*

The text to split.

`length`: *Integer*

The maximum length of a single substring.

`delimiter`: *String*

A delimiter that is used to separate substrings.

## Return values

*Record list*

The resulting list of records.

## Usage notes

The record structure of the list that is returned consists of the **Value** field of the *String* type. Every record of the list that is returned contains generated substrings in this field.

If the `delimiter` argument is empty, the new list that is returned consists of one record that has the **Value** field of the *String* type. This field contains the input text.

If the `input` argument is empty, a new empty list is returned. If either the `input` or `delimiter` argument is unspecified (null), an application exception is thrown.

## Example 1

`SPLIT ("abcd", 3)` returns a new list that consists of two records that have the **Value** field of the *String* type. The **Value** field in the first record contains the text **"abc"**, and the **Value** field in the second record contains the text **"d"**.

## Example 2

`SPLIT ("XAb aBy", "aB")` returns a new list that consists of three records that have the **Value** field of the *String* type. The **Value** field in the first record contains the text **"X"**, the **Value** field in the second record contains the text **"&nbsp;"**, and the **Value** field in the third record contains the text **"y"**.
