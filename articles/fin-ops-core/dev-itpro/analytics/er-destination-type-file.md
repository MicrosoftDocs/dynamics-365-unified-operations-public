# File destination

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can configure a file destination for each FOLDER or FILE component of an Electronic reporting (ER) format that is configured to generate outbound documents. Based on the setting of the destination, a generated document is available for download from the web browser.

On the **Destination settings** page, if you set **Enabled** to **Yes**, an open or save dialog box opens when the configuration has finished running.
