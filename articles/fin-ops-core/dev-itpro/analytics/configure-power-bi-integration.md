# Configure PowerBI.com integration

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Overview

Users can pin tiles, dashboards, and reports from their own PowerBI.com account to application workspace.

This functionality requires a one-time configuration of your environment. An administrator must do this step to enable Microsoft Power BI to communicate and authenticate correctly.

For a workspace to show a Power BI tile, the server must contact the Power BI service on behalf of a user and access the visualization. It must then redraw the visualization in the application workspace. The fact that the server contacts the Power BI service "on behalf of a user" is important. When a user, such as `D365User@contoso.com`, contacts the PowerBI.com service, Power BI should show only tiles and reports from the user's PowerBI.com subscription.

By completing this configuration step, you enable to contact the PowerBI.com service.

## Things you must know before you start 

- You must be a system administrator in the application. This option is available on the **System administration** menu.
- You must have a PowerBI.com account. You can create a trial account if you don't have an account. (A Pro license isn't required for this configuration step.)
- You must have at least one dashboard and one report in your Power BI account. Although the dashboard and report aren't required for this configuration step, you might not be able to validate the configuration if you don't have any content in your PowerBI.com account.
- You must be an administrator for your Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account. If you aren't the administrator, an administrative user must perform this configuration step for you.
- The Azure AD domain that is configured must be the same domain that you used for your PowerBI.com account. For example, if you provisioned the application in the Contoso.com domain, you must have Power BI accounts in that domain, such as `Tim@ContosoAX7.onmicrosoft.com`.
- Users navigating to these pinned tiles must have a valid Power BI.com license.

## Registration process 

1. Sign in to https://portal.azure.com/ using an Azure tenant admin account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The user who completes this procedure must have Admin rights for the tenant to register applications.

2. Go to **Azure Active Directory** \> **App registrations** \> **New application registration**. 
3. Enter the following values:

    - **Name** – Enter the name of your app.
    - **Supported account types** – Enter only accounts that are directly in this organization (single tenant).
    - **Application type** – Enter **Web**.
    - **Redirect URI** – Enter the base URL of your client with **oauth** appended to the end, such as `https://contosoax7.cloud.dynamics.com/oauth`.
    
4. Select **Register**.
5. Copy the **Application (client) ID** value. You will use this value to connect to the PowerBI.com service.

    > [!IMPORTANT] 
    > Be sure to capture the **Application (client) ID** value.

6. Select **Manage** \> **API permissions** \> **Add a permission** \> **Microsoft APIs** \> **Power BI Service**.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > For Government Community Cloud, instead of selecting **Power BI Service**, search for and select **Microsoft Power BI Government Community Cloud** in the **APIs my organization uses** tab.

8. Select **Select Delegated permissions**.
9. Enable the following permissions:

    - **Content**

        - Content.Create

    - **Dashboard**

        - Dashboard.Read.All

    - **Dataset**

        - Dataset.Read.All
        - Dataset.ReadWrite.All

    - **Report**

        - Report.Read.All

    - **Workspace**

        - Workspace.Read.All

9. Select **Add permissions**.
10. Select **Manage** \> **Certificates & secrets**.
11. In the **Client secrets** field, select **New client secret**.
12. Enter a value in the **Description** and **Expires** fields, and then select **Add**.
13. Make a note of the **Application ID** and **Secret Value** values. You will use these values in the next procedure.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Be sure to capture the **Application (client) ID** and **Secret Value** values before you continue.

## Specify Power BI settings in Finance and Operations

1. In the Finance and Operations client, open the **PowerBI.com configuration** page.

    ![PowerBI.com configuration page](./media/D365-PBI-Configuration.png)

2. Select **Edit**.
3. Set the **Enabled** option to **Yes**.
4. In the **Application ID** field, enter the **Application ID** value that you got from Power BI in the previous procedure.
5. In the **Application key** field, enter the **Secret Value** value that you captured in Azure AD in the previous procedure.

    You can apply the company filter only if your Power BI content has a table that is named **Company** and a column that is named **ID**. Ready-made Power BI content that is released uses this convention.

6. Select **Save**.

Complete the steps in the next section to verify the changes and enable PowerBI.com integrations.

## Pin tiles to a workspace

1. To validate the PowerBI.com configuration, select **Get started**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may need to refresh the browser to apply the changes.
    >
    > ![Authorize Power BI.](./media/D365-PBI-GetStarted.png)

    If you're starting Power BI from the application for the first time, you're prompted to authorize sign-in to Power BI from the client. Select **Click here to provide authorization to Power BI**.

    Users must complete this step the first time they pin Power BI content.

2. The Azure AD consent page asks for your consent. User consent is required for the application to access PowerBI.com on behalf of the user. Select **Accept**.
3. Because you're already signed in to Azure AD, you don't have to enter your credentials again. A new tab appears, where you're prompted to authorize the connection between the application and Power BI. Authorize the connection, and then return to the original tab.
4. A list of tiles from your PowerBI.com account appears. Select one or more tiles to pin to the selected workspace.

## Troubleshooting common errors

In the procedure above, after you select **Accept**, you might receive the following error message if the process is unsuccessful. Note that the details of the error appear at the bottom of the message. Additional technical information provides clues that can help you determine what went wrong.

### Some common issues and the resolution steps

| Error                                                       | Resolution |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| The Power BI service is unavailable.                        | This issue doesn't occur very often, but the Power BI service might sometimes be unreachable. You don't have to re-register. Try to pin a tile to a workspace later. |
| You can't access the application.                           | You probably didn't select all the check boxes under **Step 8 in the Registration process** during the registration process. Start Power BI, and re-run the registration process. |
| The Power BI tiles page is empty (no content is shown).     | Your PowerBI.com account might not have a dashboard or any tiles. Add a dashboard, such as a sample dashboard, and try to pin a tile again. |
| Error when authorizing Power BI                             | On the Azure Admin dashboard, under **Users and Groups \> User settings**, make sure that the **Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf** option is set to **Yes**. |
| Sorry, something went wrong. The authentication process was not successful. Please contact your system administrator.  | This may occur in cases where service keys have expired. We recommend performing the registration process above, starting with step 3. When complete, be sure to update the PowerBI.com settings at **AX client \> System administration \> Set up \> PowerBI.com integration**. |
