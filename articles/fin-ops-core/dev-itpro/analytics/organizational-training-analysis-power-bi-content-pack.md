# Organizational training Power BI content

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the Finance and Operations - Organizational training Power BI content.

## Reports that are included in the content pack
After you've connected the content pack to your data, the reports show your organization's data. If you've never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.

| Report          | Contents                                                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Course Analysis | Registration by location, course attendees by status, and registration list |
| Course Types    | Course types by skill                                                       |

You can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure A Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).
