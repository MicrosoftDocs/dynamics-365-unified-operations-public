# Reset the Financial reporting data mart

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to reset the Financial reporting data mart for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. The data mart can be reset in multiple ways, depending on the user's role and access to the client or infrastructure.

In specific scenarios, you might have to reset the data mart for Financial reporting. Here are some examples:

- The application database was restored, but the data mart database wasn't restored.
- You see incorrect data for a period, and you've determined that the issue isn't a report design issue.
- You see incorrect data for a period, and records appear under integration attempts on Report designer integration status page (start the Report designer and select **Tools** > **Integration status**).
- Support instructs you to reset the data mart as part of a troubleshooting step.

You should reset the data mart only when a small amount of processing is occurring on the database. Financial reporting will be unavailable during the reset process.

> [!NOTE]
> A reset of the data mart doesn't affect any report definitions that define the structure of reports. Nevertheless, it's always a good idea to have a backup of your reports. For information about how to back up report definitions, see the note at the end of this topic.

### Reset the Financial reporting data mart from Report designer

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this process are supported for Financial reporting release 7.2.6.0 and later.

To find the version of report designer, watch this video: [How to find the version of Report designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icfA5Q3kp4w)

To reset the data mart, in Report designer, on the **Tools** menu, select **Reset Data Mart** as shown in the following illustration. The dialog box that appears has two sections: **Statistics** and **Reset**.

[![Reset Data Mart dialog box](./media/Reset-72.jpg)](./media/Reset-72.jpg)

##### Integration attempts

The **Integration attempts** grid shows how many times the system has tried to integrate transactions. The system continues to try to integrate data over a period of days if the first few attempts aren't successful. You will know that the data mart must be reset is if the number of attempts is 8 or more, and if there are many Dimension combination or Transaction records. In this situation, the data won't be reported on.

##### Data status

The **Data status** grid provides a snapshot of the transactions, exchange rates, and dimension values in the data mart. A large number of stale records indicates that numerous updates to the records have occurred. This situation might increase the time that is required to generate reports.

##### Misaligned main account categories

If you're using a release that is earlier than Financial reporting release 7.2.1, you might have to reset the data mart if you rename accounts and move accounts between account categories. These actions can cause main account categories to become misaligned. The **Misaligned main account categories** field shows whether you're experiencing that issue.

### Reset the data mart and select a reason

If you determine that a data mart reset is required, select the **Reset data mart** check box, and then select a reason in the **Reason** field. The following options are available:

- **Missing or incorrect data** – Based on the statistics, you've determined that data might be missing. Before you continue, we recommend that you work with Support to determine the root cause.
- **Restore database** – The database was restored, but the database for the Financial reporting data mart wasn't restored.
- **Other** – You're resetting the data mart for another reason. If you're concerned that there is an issue, contact Support to identify it.

[![Reset data mart](./media/Integration.png)](./media/Integration.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Verify that all data mart reset tasks have completed an initial load before you begin a reset. You can confirm this by looking for a value in the Last Runtime column by selecting **Tools** &gt; **Integration status**.

#### Clear users and companies

Select the **Clear users and companies** check box if you restored your database, but then changed users or companies. You should rarely have to select this check box.

When you're ready to start the reset process, select **OK**. You're prompted to confirm that you're ready to start the process. Note that Financial reporting won't be available during the reset and the initial data integration that occurs afterward.

If you want to review the status of the integration, select **Tools** &gt; **Integration status** to see the last time that the integration was run and the status.

[![View the status of the integration](./media/New-integration.PNG)](./media/New-integration.PNG)

> [!NOTE]
> The reset is finished when all mappings show a status of **RanToCompletion**, and an "Integration complete" message appears in the lower-left corner of the **Integration Status** dialog box.

## Reset the Financial reporting data mart through Windows PowerShell

If you ever restore your database from a backup or copy the database from another environment, you must follow the steps in this section to help guarantee that the Financial reporting data mart correctly uses the restored database.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this process are supported for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance application version 7.0.1 (May 2016) (application build 7.0.1265.23014 and Financial reporting build 7.0.10000.4) and later. If you have an earlier version, contact Support for assistance.

### Stop services

The following Microsoft Windows services will have open connections to the Finance and Operations database. Therefore, you must use Microsoft Remote Desktop to connect to all the computers in the environment and then use services.msc to stop these services.

- World wide web publishing service (on all Application Object Servers \[AOS\] computers)
- Batch Management Service (on non-private AOS computers only)
- Management Reporter 2012 Process Service (on Business intelligence \[BI\] computers only)

### Reset

#### Download the latest MinorVersionDataUpgrade.zip package

Download the latest MinorVersionDataUpgrade.zip package. For instructions about how to find and download the correct version of the data upgrade package, see the section [Upgrade data in development or demo environments](../migration-upgrade/upgrade-data-to-latest-update.md#select-the-correct-data-upgrade-deployable-package) in the Upgrade data in development, demo, or sandbox environments topic.

An upgrade isn't required in order to download the MinorVersionDataUpgrade.zip package. Therefore, you just have to follow the steps in the "Download the latest data upgrade deployable package" section of that topic. You can skip all the other steps in the topic.

#### Run prerequisite SQL scripts against the database

Run the following scripts against the database (not against the Financial reporting database):

- DataUpgrade.zip\\AosService\\Scripts\\ConfigureAxReportingIntegration.sql
- DataUpgrade.zip\\AosService\\Scripts\\GrantAzViewChangeTracking.sql

These scripts help guarantee that the users, roles, and change tracking settings are correct.

#### Run a Windows PowerShell script to reset the database

On the AOS computer, start Microsoft Windows PowerShell as an administrator, and run the following commands to reset the integration between application and Financial reporting.

```powershell
F:
cd F:\MRApplicationService\MRInstallDirectory
Import-Module .\Server\MRDeploy\MRDeploy.psd1
Reset-DatamartIntegration -Reason OTHER -ReasonDetail "<reason for resetting>" -SkipMRTableReset
```

> [!NOTE]
> - SkipMRTableReset preserves tree unit security if you're using it.
> - If you get an error that a parameter cannot be found that matches SkipMRTableReset, you can remove the parameter and try again (later versions have updated the default behavior to include this switch).

Here is an explanation of the parameters in the **Reset-DatamartIntegration** command:

- The valid values for **-Reason** are **SERVICING**, **BADDATA**, and **OTHER**.
- The **-ReasonDetail** parameter is free text.
- The reason and reason detail will be recorded in telemetry/environment monitoring.

> [!NOTE]
> After you run the commands, you will be asked to enter **Y** to confirm that you want to reset the database.

#### Restart services

Use services.msc to restart the services that you stopped earlier:

- World wide web publishing service (on all AOS computers)
- Batch Management Service (on non-private AOS computers only)
- Management Reporter 2012 Process Service (on BI computers only)

## Reset the Financial reporting data mart for Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises) through SQL Server Management Studio

1. Instruct all users to close Report designer and exit the Financial reporting area.
2. Run the following script against the Financial reporting database (MRDB).

    ```sql
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ---- Set service into disabled mode
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    --setup for servicing mode
    BEGIN TRANSACTION
    IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'Servicing')
    BEGIN 
        EXEC ('CREATE SCHEMA Servicing') 
    END

    IF (DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_ID('GeneralUser') IS NULL)
    BEGIN
        CREATE ROLE [GeneralUser] AUTHORIZATION [dbo];
    END
    ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON SCHEMA::Servicing TO [GeneralUser]

    IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT NAME FROM SYS.TABLES WHERE Name = 'ServicingLock')
    BEGIN 
        CREATE TABLE [Servicing].[ServicingLock] ([Name] nvarchar(255) not null, [Value] int not null, [LastServiceTimestamp] datetime      null)
    END

    IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM [Servicing].[ServicingLock])
    BEGIN 
        INSERT INTO [Servicing].[ServicingLock] (Name, Value) VALUES ('ServicingLockMode', 0)
    END
    COMMIT TRANSACTION

    --Enable servicing mode
    IF EXISTS(SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'Scheduling' COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT AND TABLE_NAME = 'SchedulerRegister' COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT AND COLUMN_NAME = 'ServicingMode' COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT)
    BEGIN		
       UPDATE Scheduling.SchedulerRegister SET ServicingMode = 1 WHERE ServicingMode = 0		
       UPDATE [Servicing].[ServicingLock] SET Name = 'SchedulerServicingMode', Value = 1, LastServiceTimestamp = GETUTCDATE() WHERE Value = 0
    END

    --Disable maps
    DECLARE @triggerIds table(id uniqueidentifier, taskTypeId uniqueidentifier)
    INSERT INTO @triggerIds SELECT tr.[Id], tt.[Id]
    FROM [Scheduling].[Task] t with(nolock)
    JOIN [Scheduling].[Trigger] tr ON t.[TriggerId] = tr.[Id]
    JOIN [Scheduling].[TaskState] ts ON ts.[TaskId] = t.[Id]
    LEFT JOIN [Scheduling].[TaskCategory] tc ON tc.[Id] = t.[CategoryId]
    JOIN [Scheduling].[TaskType] tt ON t.[TypeId] = tt.[Id]
    WHERE tt.[Id] IN ('D81C1197-D486-4FB7-AF8C-078C110893A0', '55D3F71A-2618-4EAE-9AA6-D48767B974D8') -- 'Maintenance Task', 'Map Task'
    PRINT 'Disable integration tasks'
    UPDATE [Scheduling].[Trigger] SET IsEnabled = 0 WHERE [Id] in (SELECT id FROM @triggerIds)
    ```

3. Truncate or delete all records from the FINANCIALREPORTS table in the database (AXDB).
4. Truncate or delete all records from the FINANCIALREPORTVERSION table, if this table exists in the database. If the table doesn't exist in the database, skip this step.
5. Run the **ResetDatamart.sql** script against the Financial reporting database. This script disables the data mart integration, deletes all the data mart data, and then reenables the data mart integration.

    ```sql

6. After the reset, you can manually verify the data reload by running the following query against the Financial reporting database.

    ```sql
    select ReaderObjectName, WriterObjectName, LastRunTime, StateType from Connector.MapsWithDetail with (nolock)
    ```

    Confirm that all rows have a **LastRunTime** value, and that **StateType** is set to **5**. A **StateType** value of **5** indicates that the data was successfully reloaded. A value of **7** indicates a faulted state. Sometimes, the Organization Hierarchy map has this state the first time that it runs. However, the faulted state but should be automatically resolved.

## Export and import report definitions

Although a reset of the data mart doesn't affect any report definitions, some data movement activities can cause report definitions to be lost. Be very careful when you perform a data movement activity such as overwriting a user acceptance testing (UAT) test environment with a copy of the production environment if new reports were being created in the UAT environment.

### Export report definitions

First, follow these steps to export the report designs from Report designer.

1. In Report designer, select **Company** &gt; **Building Block Groups**.
2. Select the building block group to export, and then select **Export**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For Finance and Operations, only one building block group is supported: **Default**.

3. Select the report definitions to export:

    - To export all your report definitions and the associated building blocks, select **Select All**.
    - To export specific reports, rows, columns, trees, or dimension sets, select the appropriate tab, and then select the items to export. To select multiple items on a tab, press and hold the **Ctrl** key while you make your selections. When you select reports to export, the associated rows, columns, trees, and dimension sets are also selected.

4. Select **Export**.
5. Enter a file name, and select a secure location to save the exported report definitions in.
6. Select **Save**.

You can copy or upload the file to a secure location.

> [!WARNING]
> Be aware of the behavior of drive D on Microsoft Azure virtual machines (VMs). Don't permanently store your exported building block groups on drive D. For more information about temporary drives, see [Understanding the temporary drive on Windows Azure Virtual Machines](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2013/12/06/understanding-the-temporary-drive-on-windows-azure-virtual-machines/).

### Import report definitions

Next, import your report designs from Report designer by using the file that was created during export.

1. In Report designer, select **Company** &gt; **Building Block Groups**.
2. Select the **Default** building block, and then select **Import**.
3. Select the file that contains the exported report definitions, and then select **Open**.
4. In the **Import** dialog box, select the report definitions to import:

    - To import all the report definitions and the associated building blocks, select **Select All**.
    - To import specific reports, rows, columns, trees, or dimension sets, select them.

5. Select **Import**.
