# Document reporting preview options

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Finance and operations apps offer an expanded collection of options to use while previewing documents within the embedded PDF viewer. This article describes the **Export** and **Network Printer** options.

## Overview

The efficient publication and distribution of documents is not only a key component to many operations, but it's also critical to daily business functions. Use documents to capture transaction details and represent agreements between two parties. Business documents come in many forms, from quotations to sales invoices used in the packing slip process, which ultimately produces receipts and customer statements. The document reporting preview options empower you to quickly take the appropriate action on documents.

## File export

Additional user options replace functions previously supplied by the HTML-based **Report viewer** control. Use these toolbar options to export files to the various supported formats. This list includes Microsoft Word, Excel, HTML, CSV, and more. To ensure a consistent layout with the printer output, the new modern experience displays documents by using the PDF pagination rules. For more information, see [Pagination in reports](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/pagination-in-reporting-services-report-builder-and-ssrs).

## Network printing

You can choose to print on locally connected devices by using the **Print** button or send documents directly to network printers by using the toolbar option. With the network print option, you can initiate print instructions to network connected printers while working remotely from nearly any internet connected device, including mobile phones.

Use the toolbar option to choose the network printer and establish print settings.
