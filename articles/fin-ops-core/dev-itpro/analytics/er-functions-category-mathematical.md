# List of ER functions in the mathematical category

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Electronic reporting (ER) mathematical functions can be used to do many common mathematical calculations. This article provides a summary of these functions.

## List of supported functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Abs](er-functions-mathematical-abs.md)             | This function returns the absolute value (modulus) of the specified number as a *Real* value. In other words, it returns the number without its sign. |
| [Power](er-functions-mathematical-power.md)         | This function returns a *Real* value that represents the result of raising the specified positive number to the specified power. |
| [Round](er-functions-mathematical-round.md)         | This function returns the specified number as a *Real* value after it has been rounded to the specified number of decimal places. |
| [RoundDown](er-functions-mathematical-rounddown.md) | This function returns the specified number as a *Real* value after it has been rounded down to the specified number of decimal places. |
| [RoundUp](er-functions-mathematical-roundup.md)     | This function returns the specified number as a *Real* value after it has been rounded up to the specified number of decimal places. |
