# Customize Electronic reporting configurations to generate an electronic document

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The [Electronic reporting (ER) framework](general-electronic-reporting.md) lets you upload the ER [configurations](general-electronic-reporting.md#Configuration) that Microsoft provides into your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance instance. In this way, the Microsoft-provided configurations can serve as the ER solution that is used to generate electronic customer invoices (e-invoices). You can use this ER solution to configure your custom ER solution to access your custom database fields and generate e-invoices that are compliant with your specific requirements, without having to edit the source code.

## Overview

For the example in this article, you must specify a federal tax identification code as a new custom attribute of every customer that you electronically invoice. Therefore, you must customize the structure of the invoice that is currently used, by adding a new item that must be filled with the tax code in every e-invoice that is generated.

The procedures in this article explain how a user in the System Administrator, Electronic Reporting Developer, or Electronic Reporting Functional Consultant role can perform the following tasks in your Finance instance:

- [Configure the minimal set of ER parameters that is required to start to use the ER framework](#ConfigureER).
- [Import the initial versions of the standard ER configurations that are provided to generate e-invoices](#ImportERConfigurations1).
- [Configure the Accounts receivable parameters to start to use the standard ER configurations](#ConfigureAR1).
- [Configure the legal entity parameters to invoice customers](#ConfigureLE).
- [Prepare a customer record for electronic invoicing](#ConfigureCustomer1).
- [Add, post, and send a customer invoice by using the standard ER configurations](#ProcessInvoice1).
- [Add a custom database field to manage a federal tax identification code for customers](#AddCustomField).
- [Refresh the ER metadata to enable database changes for the ER model mapping designer](#RefreshERMetadata).
- [Design the custom ER configurations to generate e-invoices that contain the new tax code](#DesignCustomERConfigurations).
- [Configure the Accounts receivable parameters to start to use the custom ER configurations](#ConfigureAR2).
- [Update a customer record for electronic invoicing](#ConfigureCustomer2).
- [Add, post, and send a customer invoice by using the custom ER configurations](#ProcessInvoice2).
- [Import the new versions of the standard ER configurations that are provided to generate e-invoices](#ImportERConfigurations2).
- [Adopt the changes to the new versions of the standard ER configurations in your custom ER configurations](#RebaseCustomERConfigurations).
- [Add, post, and send a customer invoice by using the new versions of the custom ER configurations](#ProcessInvoice3).

All these procedures can be completed in the **DEMF** company.

## <a name="ConfigureER"></a>Configure the ER framework

As a user in the Electronic Reporting Functional Consultant or Electronic Reporting Developer role, you must configure the minimal set of ER parameters. You can then start to use the ER framework to design custom versions of the standard configurations of the ER solution that is used to generate e-invoices.

### Configure ER parameters

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization blueprint** page, in the **Related links** section, select **Electronic reporting parameters**.
3. On the **Electronic reporting parameters** page, on the **General** tab, set the **Enable design mode** option to **Yes**.
4. On the **Attachments** tab, in the **Configurations** field, select **File**.
5. In the **Job archive**, **Temporary**, **Baseline**, and **Others** fields, select the **File** type.

For more information about ER parameters, see [Configure the ER framework](electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).

### Activate an ER configuration provider

Every ER configuration that is added is marked as owned by an ER configuration provider. The ER configuration provider that is activated in the **Electronic reporting** workspace is used for this purpose. Therefore, you must activate an ER configuration provider in the **Electronic reporting** workspace before you start to add or edit ER configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the owner of an ER configuration can edit it. Therefore, before an ER configuration can be edited, the appropriate ER configuration provider must be activated in the **Electronic reporting** workspace.

#### Review the list of ER configuration providers

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization blueprint** page, in the **Related links** section, select **Configuration providers**.
3. On the **Configuration provider table** page, each provider record has a unique name and URL. Review the contents of this page. If a record for **Litware, Inc.** (`https://www.litware.com`) already exists, skip the next procedure, [Add a new ER configuration provider](#AddProvider).

#### <a id="AddProvider"></a>Add a new ER configuration provider

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization blueprint** page, in the **Related links** section, select **Configuration providers**.
3. On the **Configuration providers** page, select **New**.
4. In the **Name** field, enter **Litware, Inc.**
5. In the **Internet address** field, enter `https://www.litware.com`.
6. Select **Save**.

#### Activate an ER configuration provider

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization blueprint** page, in the **Configuration providers** section, select the **Litware, Inc.** tile, and then select **Set active**.

For more information about ER configuration providers, see [Create configuration providers and mark them as active](tasks/er-configuration-provider-mark-it-active-2016-11.md).

## <a name="ImportERConfigurations1"></a>Import the initial versions of standard ER configurations

To add the standard ER configurations to your current Finance instance, you must import them from the ER [repository](general-electronic-reporting.md#Repository) that was configured for that instance.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization blueprint** page, in the **Configuration providers** section, select the **Microsoft** tile, and then select **Repositories** to view the list of repositories for the Microsoft provider.
3. On the **Configuration repositories** page, select the repository of the **Global** type, and then select **Open**. If you're prompted for authorization to connect to Regulatory Configuration Service, follow the authorization instructions.
4. On the **Configuration repository** page, in the configuration tree in the left pane, select the **Peppol Sales Invoice** format configuration.
5. On the **Versions** FastTab, select version **11.2.2**.
6. Select **Import** to download the selected version from the Global repository.

![Configuration repository page.](./media/er-quick-start3-import-solution1.png)

> [!TIP]
> If you have trouble accessing the [Global repository](er-download-configurations-global-repo.md), you can [download configurations](download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md) from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) instead.

### Review the imported ER configurations

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization blueprint** page, in the **Configurations** section, select the **Reporting configurations** tile.
3. On the **Configurations** page, expand the **Configuration components** FastTab.
4. In the configuration tree in the left pane, expand **Invoice model**, and then expand **UBL Sales invoice**.

Notice that, in addition to the selected **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format, other required ER configurations were imported. Because new versions of ER configurations are constantly published to the Global repository and LCS to keep the corresponding solutions compliant with new requirements, the latest versions of the required data model configuration and its model mapping configurations were imported.

![Configurations page.](./media/er-quick-start3-imported-solution1a.png)

To simulate the state that ER configurations in the current Finance instance  would be in if you imported version **11.2.2** of the **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format in the past (for example, on August 7, 2019), follow these steps.

- On the Action Pane, select **Delete** to delete all ER configurations that were published after August 7, 2019. The only **Invoice model**, **Invoice model mapping** (initially named **Customer invoice model mapping**), **UBL Sales invoice** and **Peppol Sales Invoice** configurations must be left.
- For the remained ER configurations, on the **Versions** FastTab, select **Delete** to delete all versions of ER configurations that were published after August 7, 2019.

Then verify that the following configurations are available in the configuration tree:

- **Invoice model** ER data model configuration (initially named **Customer invoice model**):

    - Version 11 contains version 10 of the data model ER component that represents the data structure of the invoicing business domain. This ER configuration has been imported as an ancestor of the **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format that was selected for import.
    - Version 50 contains version 31 of the data model ER component. This ER configuration has been imported as an ancestor of the August 7, 2019, version of the **Invoice model mapping** ER model mapping configuration.

    ![Invoice model ER data model configuration on the Configurations page.](./media/er-quick-start3-imported-solution1b1.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't see version 50 of this data model, open the Global repository, and import version 50.19 of the **Invoice model mapping** ER configuration.

- **Invoice model mapping** ER model mapping configuration (initially named **Customer invoice model mapping**):

    - Version 50.19 has been imported as the latest implementation of version 50 of the **Invoice model** ER data model configuration. It contains two model mapping ER components that describe how the data model is filled in with application data at runtime.

    ![Invoice model mapping ER model mapping configuration on the Configurations page.](./media/er-quick-start3-imported-solution1b2.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't see version 50.19 of this model mapping, open the Global repository, and import version 50.19 of the **Invoice model mapping** ER configuration.

- **UBL Sales invoice** ER format configuration:

    - Version 11.2 contains the format and format mapping ER components. The format component specifies the report layout. The format mapping component contains the model data source and specifies how this data source is used to fill in the report layout at runtime. This ER format was configured to generate e-invoices in Universal Business Language (UBL) format. It has been imported as a parent of the **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format that was selected for import.

- **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format configuration:

    - Version 11.2.2 contains the format and format mapping ER components that were configured to generate e-invoices in Pan-European Public Procurement OnLine (PEPPOL) format.

## <a name="ImportERConfigurations2"></a>Import the latest versions of standard ER configurations

To keep the set of standard ER configurations in your Finance instance [up to date](general-electronic-reporting-manage-configuration-lifecycle.md), you must import new versions of them whenever they become available in the ER [repository](general-electronic-reporting.md#Repository) that was configured for that instance.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization configurations** page, in the **Configuration providers** section, select the **Microsoft** tile, and then select **Repositories** to view the list of repositories for the Microsoft provider.
3. On the **Configuration repositories** page, select the repository of the **Global** type, and then select **Open**. If you're prompted for authorization to connect to Regulatory Configuration Service, follow the authorization instructions.
4. On the **Configuration repository** page, in the configuration tree in the left pane, select the **Peppol Sales Invoice** format configuration.
5. On the **Versions** FastTab, select version **32.6.7** of the selected ER format configuration that has been released to support customer electronic invoices in PEPPOL BIS 3 format. For more information, see [KB4490320](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4490320/an-update-for-european-union-to-support-export-of-customers-electronic).
6. Select **Import** to download the selected version from the Global repository to the current Finance instance.

![Version 32.6.7 selected on the Configuration repository page.](./media/er-quick-start3-import-solution2.png)

For information about how this process can be automated, see [Import updated versions of ER configurations](er-download-updated-versions-global-repo.md).

### Review the imported ER configurations

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization configurations** page, in the **Configurations** section, select the **Reporting configurations** tile.
3. Expand the **Configuration components** FastTab.
4. In the configuration tree in the left pane, expand **Invoice model**. Notice that the name of **Customer invoice model** has been changed to **Invoice model** in one of the imported ER data model configurations.
5. In the configuration tree in the left pane, expand **Invoice model mapping**. Notice that the name of **Customer invoice model mapping** has been changed to **Invoice model mapping** in one of the imported ER model mapping configurations.
6. Expand **UBL Sales invoice** \> **Peppol Sales Invoice**.

Notice that, in addition to the selected **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format, the latest versions of other required ER configurations were imported. Because new versions of ER configurations are constantly published to the Global repository and LCS to keep the corresponding ER solutions compliant with new requirements, the latest versions of the required data model configuration and its model mapping configurations were imported.

Make sure that the following ER configurations are eventually available in the configuration tree:

- **Invoice model** ER data model configuration:

    - Version 206 (or later) contains version 24 (or later) of the data model ER component that represents the data structure of the invoicing business domain. This ER configuration has been imported as an ancestor of the latest available **Invoice model mapping** ER model mapping configuration.

    ![Version 206 on the Configurations page.](./media/er-quick-start3-imported-solution2b1.png)

- **Invoice model mapping** ER model mapping configuration:

    - Version 206.132 (or later) has been imported as the latest implementation of version 206 of the **Invoice model** ER data model configuration. It contains several model mapping ER components that describe how the data model is filled in with application data at runtime.

    ![Version 206.132 on the Configurations page.](./media/er-quick-start3-imported-solution2b2.png)

- **UBL Sales invoice** ER format configuration:

    - Version 32.6 contains the format and format mapping ER components. The format component specifies the report layout. The format mapping component contains the model data source and specifies how this data source is used to fill in the report layout at runtime. This ER format was configured to generate e-invoices in UBL format. It has been imported as a parent of the **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format that was selected for import.

- **Peppol Sales Invoice** ER format configuration:

    - Version 32.6.7 contains the format and format mapping ER components that were configured to generate e-invoices in PEPPOL format.
