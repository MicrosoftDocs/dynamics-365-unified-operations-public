# Import data from manually selected files in batch mode

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include[banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

To use the [Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) framework to import data from manually selected inbound files in batch mode, configure an ER [format](er-overview-components.md#format-component) that supports the import. Then run a [model mapping](er-overview-components.md#model-mapping-component) of the **To destination** type that uses that format as a data source. To import data, browse to the file that you want to import, and manually select it. 

The new ER capability that supports data import in batch mode enables this process to be configured as unattended. You can use ER configurations to perform data import by scheduling a new batch job from the ER user interface (UI).

This article explains how to complete data import from a manually selected file in batch mode. The examples use vendor transactions as business data. The steps of these examples can be completed in the **USMF** company. No coding is required.

## Prerequisites

To complete the examples in this article, you must have the following access:

- One of the following roles:

    - Electronic reporting developer
    - Electronic reporting functional consultant
    - System administrator

- ER format and model configurations for 1099 payments

### Create the required ER configurations

To create the required ER configurations and obtain other prerequisites, follow one of these steps:

- Play the **ER Import data from a Microsoft Excel file** task guides, which are part of the **7.5.4.3 Acquire/Develop IT service/solution components (10677)** business process. These task guides walk you through the process of designing and using ER configurations that interactively import vendor transactions from Microsoft Excel files. For more information, see [Parse incoming documents in Excel format](parse-incoming-documents-excel.md).
- Complete the examples in [Configure data import from SharePoint](er-configure-data-import-sharepoint.md). These examples walk you through the process of designing and using ER configurations that interactively import vendor transactions from Excel files that are stored in a SharePoint folder.

### Download the required ER configurations

1. Download the following ER configurations, and save them locally.

    | Content description | File |
    |---------------------|------|
    | **1099 Payments model** ER data model configuration | [1099model.xml](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/d/9/bd9e8373-d558-4ab8-aa9b-31981adc97ea/1099model.xml) |
    | **For importing vendors' transactions (Excel)** ER format configuration | [1099format-import-from-excel.xml](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/3/8/b38faf0a-fbaf-4e9e-84c2-dedae7464880/1099format-import-from-excel.xml) |

2. Use the [Load from XML file](er-defer-sequence-element.md#import-the-sample-er-configurations) ER option to import the downloaded ER configurations into your instance of Dynamics 365 Finance in the following order:

    1. ER data model configuration
    2. ER format configuration

### Download the required Excel files

- Download the following sample data set, and save it locally.

    | Content description | File |
    |---------------------|------|
    | Inbound **1099import-data.xlsx** file that contains sample data for import | [1099import-data.xlsx](https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/f/4/ff4dbce9-8364-4391-adee-877945ff01f7/1099import-data.xlsx) |

### Review the prerequisites

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Electronic reporting** \> **Configurations**.
2. On the **Configurations** page, review the prepared ER solution for data import in batch mode.
3. Review the **For importing vendors' transactions (Excel)** format configuration.

    - The format component of this configuration is designed to parse an inbound Excel file.
    - The model mapping component of this configuration is used to fill in the base data model by using data from the parsed Excel file.

4. Review the **1099 Payments model** data model configuration.

    - The model component of this configuration represents the structure of the data model that is used to pass data between running ER components.
    - The model mapping component of this configuration is used to pull data from the executed format component and then update application tables.

5. Open the **1099import-data.xlsx** file in the Excel.

    ![Sample Excel file with data for import in batch mode.](./media/er-configure-data-import-batch-excel-content.png)

## Enable batch data import for ER from the UI

1. Go to **System administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Feature management**.
2. In the **Feature management** workspace, select the **Run ER import of manually uploaded documents in batch** feature, and then select **Enable now**.

## Import data from manually selected Excel files

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Electronic reporting** \> **Configurations**.
2. On the **Configurations** page, select the **1099 Payments model** data model configuration.
3. On the **Configuration components** FastTab, select the **For 1099 manual transactions import** link.
4. On the **Model to datasource mapping** page, the **For 1099 manual transactions import** model mapping is preselected. Select **Run**.
5. On the **Parameters** tab, select **Browse**. Find and select the **1099import-data.xlsx** file, and then select **OK**.
6. In the **Enter voucher id** field, enter **V-00001**.
7. On the **Run in the background** tab, set the **Batch processing** option to **Yes**.

    Notice that the **Task description** field is set to **Run of Model mapping 'For 1099 manual transactions import', configuration '1099 Payments model'**. This value indicates that the execution of the selected model mapping will be scheduled as a new batch job.
