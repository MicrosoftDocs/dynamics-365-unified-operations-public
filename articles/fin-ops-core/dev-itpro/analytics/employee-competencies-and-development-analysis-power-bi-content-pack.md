# Employee competencies and development Power BI content

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the Employee competencies and development Power BI content. 

## Reports that are included in the content pack
After you've connected the content pack to your data, the reports show your organization's data. If you've never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.

| Report                            | Contents                                               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Competency & Development Analysis | Team member skill types and team member skills by type |
| Skill Profile                     | Skill profile for the selected employee                |
| Skill Analysis                    | Skills by type and rating                              |

You can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure A Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).

## Understanding the data model and entities
