# Financial reporting

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Financial reporting for the application allows financial and business professionals to create, maintain, deploy, and view financial statements. It moves beyond traditional reporting constraints to help you efficiently design various types of reports.

Financial reporting includes dimension support. Therefore, account segments or dimensions are immediately available. No additional tools or configuration steps are required.

## Financial reporting setup
The **Financial reporting setup** page has a list of all financial dimensions in the system. **General ledger** \> **Ledger setup** \> **Financial reporting setup**.

The **Financial reporting setup** page has two sections that determine the data you report on in Financial reporting:

- **Dimensions tab** - Because different companies use different dimensions and account structures, there is no way to determine the order in which users want to view all financial dimensions on reports. This page allows you set the order in which you want financial dimensions to appear when you build and view a report in Financial reporting.
- **Attributes tab** is where you can select whether you want the ability to use **Vendors** and **Customers** as attributes for filtering and report design. Reporting on Vendor and Customer will only be valuable if you do not enter multiple vendors or customers in a single voucher when posting transactions. Choosing Vendor and/or Customer will add additional time to the integration.

## Financial reporting components
The following components of financial reporting make it easy to create, view, and schedule reports.

| Component        | Functions | Additional information |
