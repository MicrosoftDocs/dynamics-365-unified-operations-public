# SPLITLIST ER function

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The `SPLITLIST` function splits the specified list into sublists (or batches), each of which contains the specified number of records. It then returns the result as a new *Record list* value that consists of the batches.

## Syntax 1

```vb
SPLITLIST (list, number)
```

## Syntax 2

```vb
SPLITLIST (list, number, on-demand reading flag)
```

## Arguments

`list`: *Record list*

The valid path of a data source of the *Record list* data type.

`number`: *Integer*

The maximum number of records per batch.

`on-demand reading flag`: *Boolean*

A *Boolean* value that specifies whether elements of sublists should be generated on demand.

## Return values

*Record list*

The resulting list of records.

## Usage notes

The list of batches that is returned contains the following elements:

 - **Value:** *List*

    The list of records that belong to the current batch.

- **BatchNumber:** *Integer*

    The number of the current batch in the returned list.

When the on-demand reading flag is set to **True**, sublists are generated upon request which allows for a reduction in memory consumption but may cause performance degradation if elements aren't used sequentially.

## Example

In the following illustration, a **Lines** data source is created as a record list that has three records. This list is divided into batches, each of which contains up to two records.

The following illustration shows the designed format layout. In this format layout, bindings to the **Lines** data source are created to generate output in XML format. This output presents individual nodes for each batch and the records in it.

The following illustration shows the result when the designed format is run.
