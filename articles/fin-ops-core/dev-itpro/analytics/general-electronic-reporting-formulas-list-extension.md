# Extend the list of Electronic reporting (ER) functions

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Various types of functions are supported in Electronic reporting (ER) expressions for data transformation – text, date and time, mathematical logical, information, data type conversion, and other (business domain–specific functions). In addition to built-in functions, ER lets you extend the list of available functions. This article includes an overview of key tasks that you must complete to introduce a new function.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, Enterprise edition 7.3, use of extensions of the **ERExpression** class is being deprecated. Instead of using extensions of the **ERExpression** class to add custom built-in ER functions, you can now implement your custom logic as public methods of your custom classes. You can then call those methods from ER formats and ER model mappings that configure the required ER data sources of either the [*Class*](er-formula-supported-data-types-composite.md#class) type or the [*Object*](er-formula-supported-data-types-composite.md#object) type. For more information, see [Design ER expressions to call application class methods](tasks/design-expressions-app-class-er.md).

All ER functions in application code are represented as classes that extend the **ERExpression** class. Two types of functions are recognized:

- **Fixed number of arguments** – These functions are represented by classes that include methods that have the prefix **parm** (see **parmInput**, **parmStartNum** in the sample code the follows). The order of arguments is set by the **SysOperationDisplayOrderAttribute** attribute.
- **Variable number of arguments** – These functions (see the **ERExpressionGenericCase** class) are represented by classes that implement the **ERIObjectContainer** interface. An additional **Add** method is used to declare the types that a function accepts.

Here are the recommended steps for introducing a new function for ER expressions:

- Select a base class for your function, based on the return value type (see **ERExpressionString** in the sample code that follows).

    - Create a new class that extends the selected class (see **ERExpressionStringMid** in the sample code the follows).

        - Provide required attributes:

            - **SysOperationLabelAttribute** – This attribute defines the function’s name.
            - **SysOperationHelpTextAttribute** – This attribute defines the function’s Help text.
            - **ERComponentGroupAttribute** – This attribute defines the group that the function belongs to. (For more information, see [Formula designer in Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting-formula-designer.md).)

        - Provide arguments:

            - For a fixed number of arguments function, provide methods that have the prefix **parm**, and use the **SysOperationDisplayOrderAttribute** attribute to set the order of the arguments.
            - For a variable number of argument function, implement the **ERIObjectContainer** interface.

        - Provide an evaluation method.

Here is an example.

```xpp
/// <summary>
/// Returns the characters from the middle of a text string, given a starting position and length.
/// </summary>
[
    SysOperationLabelAttribute ('MID'),
    SysOperationHelpTextAttribute ("@ElectronicReporting:ExpressionStringMidHelpText"),
    ERComponentGroupAttribute ("@ElectronicReporting:String")
]
class ERExpressionStringMid extends ERExpressionString
{
    ERExpressionString input;
    ERExpressionInt startNum;
    ERExpressionInt numChars;
    public str evaluateString(ERIDataContext _dataContext)
    {
        return subStr(
            this.parmInput().evaluateString(_dataContext),
            this.parmStartNum().evaluateInt(_dataContext),
            this.parmNumChars().evaluateInt(_dataContext));
    }
    [DataMemberAttribute, SysOperationLabelAttribute ("@ElectronicReporting:Input"), SysOperationDisplayOrderAttribute ("1")]
    public ERExpressionString parmInput(ERExpressionString _input = input)
    {
        input = _input;
        return input;
    }
    [DataMemberAttribute, SysOperationLabelAttribute ("@ElectronicReporting:NumChars"), SysOperationDisplayOrderAttribute ("3")]
    public ERExpressionInt parmNumChars(ERExpressionInt _numChars = numChars)
    {
        numChars = _numChars;
        return numChars;
    }
    [DataMemberAttribute, SysOperationLabelAttribute ("@ElectronicReporting:StartNum"), SysOperationDisplayOrderAttribute ("2")]
    public ERExpressionInt parmStartNum(ERExpressionInt _startNum = startNum)
    {
        startNum = _startNum;
        return startNum;
    }
    public str toString()
    {
        return ERExpressionStringPresenter::namedFunctionToStr(this);
    }
}
```

## Suggested guidance
The following guidance is intended to help you design your custom ER functions:

- Reuse the names of Microsoft Excel functions whenever you can, so that ER formulas remain Excel-like. In this way, you will keep ER formulas intelligible for end users.
- ER doesn't support list types for primitive data types. Therefore, we have decided to use a data container list that has a single **Value** item in it.
- Release a new function's list extension as a new application hotfix. ER designers will refer to the hotfix number in ER configurations that use that new custom function. Whenever a configuration of this type is imported into a new instance, ER will evaluate whether the required hotfix has been installed, to maintain compliance between the ER configuration and the version that configuration is imported into.
