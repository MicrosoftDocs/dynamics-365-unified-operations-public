# COUNTIFS ER function

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The `COUNTIFS` function returns an *Integer* value that represents the number of format elements that was collected when the format elements were used to generate an outbound document during the format run, and that satisfies the specified conditions. Each condition consists of a key range and a key value.

## Syntax

```vb
COUNTIFS (condition 1 range, condition 1 value[, condition 2 range, condition 2 value, â€¦, condition N range, condition N value])
```

## Arguments

`condition 1 range`: *String*

A value that is returned by the expression that has been configured in the **Collected data key name** property of an Electronic reporting (ER) format component. This argument is mandatory.

`condition 1 value`: *String*

A value that is returned by the expression that has been configured in the **Collected data key value** property of an ER format component. This argument is mandatory.

`condition N range`: *String*

A value that is returned by the expression that has been configured in the **Collected data key name** property of an ER format component. These additional arguments are optional.

`condition N value`: *String*

A value that is returned by the expression that has been configured in the **Collected data key value** property of an ER format component. These additional arguments are optional.

## Return values

*Integer*

The resulting numeric value.

## Usage notes

The **Collected data key name** and **Collected data key value** properties can be configured for either the **Sequence** component or the **XML Element** component of an ER format that resides under the **Common\\File** component where the **Collect output details** option is turned on.

This function returns a **0** (zero) value when the **Collect output details** option of the current **Common\\File** component is turned off.

In `condition range` arguments, the wildcard character **"\*"** can be used to represent any multiple characters.

In `condition value` arguments, the wildcard character **"\*"** can be used to represent any multiple characters.
