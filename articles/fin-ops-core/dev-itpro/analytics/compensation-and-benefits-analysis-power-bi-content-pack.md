This topic describes the Compensation and Benefits Power BI content. 

## Reports that are included in the content pack
After you've connected the content pack to your data, the reports show your organization's data. If you've never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.

| Report                     | Contents                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Comp and Benefits Analysis | Hourly and salaried employees by company, average hourly pay, average salaried pay, employees by employment type, and plan enrollment |
| Employee Benefits          | Employee enrollment by selected benefit                                                                                               |

You can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure A Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).
