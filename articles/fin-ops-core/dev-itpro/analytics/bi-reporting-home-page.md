# Reporting and analytics with Power BI home page

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article points you to resources that you can use to learn more about the business intelligence (BI) and reporting tools that are available.

## Get started

- [Information access and reporting](information-access-reporting.md)
- [Tech Talk: Reporting options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzZONjKs5xA) (video)
- [finance and operations: Power BI Analytics & Reporting Services blog](https://community.dynamics.com/365/financeandoperations/b/powerbianalyticsandreporting) (blog)

## Analytical workspaces

Workspaces can use rich infographics and visuals that Microsoft Power BI supports. These infographics and visuals include many controls that third parties provide. Therefore, workspaces can provide a highly visual, interactive experience for users.

Users can interact with data by clicking or touching visuals on the page. They can see cause and effect, and do simple what-if operations without leaving the workspace. Thanks to stunning, interactive visuals, your users have fun exploring data and discovering hidden trends.

## Business documents and printing

Reporting solutions often capture and communicate the details of business transactions. Therefore, a reporting solution must produce physical manifestations of business data by using existing devices, such as network printers. Examples of business documents include sales invoices, customer statements, and checks.

## Electronic reporting

Electronic reporting (ER) is the tool that you use to configure electronic document formats that comply with the legal requirements of various countries or regions. You can use electronic reporting for financial auditing, tax reporting, and electronic invoicing.

## Financial reporting

Standard financial reports use the default main account categories. Use the report designer to create or modify traditional financial statements, such as income statements and balance sheets. You can then share the results with other members of your organization. Examples of financial reporting include balance sheets, cash flow, and summary trial balance year over year.
