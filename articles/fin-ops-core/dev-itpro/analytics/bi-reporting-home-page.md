# Reporting and analytics with Power BI home page

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic points you to resources that you can use to learn more about the business intelligence (BI) and reporting tools that are available.

## Get started
- [Information access and reporting](information-access-reporting.md)
- [Tech Talk: Reporting options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzZONjKs5xA) (video)
- [Finance and Operations: Power BI Analytics & Reporting Services blog](https://community.dynamics.com/365/financeandoperations/b/powerbianalyticsandreporting) (blog)

## Analytical workspaces
Workspaces can use rich infographics and visuals that are supported by Microsoft Power BI. These infographics and visuals include many controls that are provided by third parties. Therefore, workspaces can provide a highly visual, interactive experience for users.

Users can interact with data by clicking or touching visuals on the page. They can see cause and effect, and do simple what-if operations without leaving the workspace. Thanks to stunning, interactive visuals, your users will have fun exploring data and discovering hidden trends.

## Business documents and printing
Reporting solutions are often used to capture and communicate the details of business transactions. Therefore, a reporting solution must be able to produce physical manifestations of business data by using existing devices, such as network printers. Examples of business documents include sales invoices, customer statements, and checks.

## Electronic reporting
Electronic reporting (ER) is the tool that you use to configure electronic document formats that comply with the legal requirements of various countries or regions. The applications of electronic reporting include financial auditing, tax reporting, and electronic invoicing.
