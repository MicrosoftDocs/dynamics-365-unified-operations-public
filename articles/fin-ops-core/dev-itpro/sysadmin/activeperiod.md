# Active batch periods

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

With the release of Platform update 21, an additional level of control over when batch jobs execute is now available. Previously, it was only possible to schedule a batch job to execute every hour for a specified number of hours or until a given date. Administrators can now provide information for an additional active period, such as in the following scenarios:
- Specifying time ranges during which jobs within a batch group can start execution. 
- Selecting to run batch jobs outside of office hours only. 
- Setting the recurrence for anytime within the active period. For example, you administrator might select to run the batch jobs every hour, but only between the hours of 6:00 PM and 8:00 AM.

> [!NOTE] 
> This feature is available as of Platform update 21.
