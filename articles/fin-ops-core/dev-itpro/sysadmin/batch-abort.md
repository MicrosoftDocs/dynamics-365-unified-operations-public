## Cancelling a batch job  

>[!NOTE]  
>System jobs cannot be moved to cancelling state.

Wherever there is a requirement to cancel a batch job that is running, you can change the status of the batch job to **Cancelling**.
This prevents the batch from picking up new tasks. The status for tasks that haven't been started are set to **Don't run**, and tasks that have started are set to **Cancelling**. The statuses of the tasks will not change until they can terminate gracefully (that is either finish or error out).

## Aborting tasks in a batch job

Sometimes status of batch jobs will remain **Cancelling** state for long time while waiting for graceful termination may not be possible. This option provides a system administrator or batch job manager with the ability to abort all the tasks that are in cancelling state for the batch job. This forces the cancelling tasks in the job to immediately stop their execution.
>[!NOTE]
> * It is important to note that this feature should be used with caution. When you abort a running process, it is an inherently unsafe action that can lead to data corruption, resulting in either orphaned or incomplete data. This action should only be used to mitigate other issues caused by the running tasks.  
> * This cannot stop the execution of tasks that are stuck in an unmanaged wait. e.g. Tasks that are stuck due to SQL deadlocks or DIXF related tasks. In cases like these, tasks will be aborted once the task is out from unmanaged wait.  

To abort all cancelling tasks of the batch job, in the batch job form, go to **Batch tasks** tab, Select **Abort**, and then select **Yes**.

### Enhanced abort feature

>[!IMPORTANT]  
>Starting with release 10.0.31, a drain period has been added. Respective batch servers will not pick up new tasks for a maximum 15 minutes after using **Enhanced batch abort**. This allows other tasks that are in an **Executing** state on those servers to finish properly. After there aren't any tasks in executing state on those servers or 15 minutes have passed, the batch servers are restarted.

Before you begin, enable the **Enhanced batch abort** feature in the [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace. After enabling this feature, **Abort** will restart all the batch servers currently running the batch tasks of the job that you are attempting to abort. When the servers are restarted there could be other tasks running on those servers which are interrupted. 

Restarting the server makes the functionality more resilient to limitations of abort and ensures that tasks of the job you are trying to cancel are truly preempted. 

To use this functionality, refer to the following steps:

1. To abort all cancelling tasks of the batch job, in the batch job form, go to **Batch tasks** tab, and select **Abort**.
2. This can potentially disrupt a list of other batch jobs which are displayed on the dialog. If you are okay with disrupting those jobs, select **Yes**.

If you do not want to cancel other running batch tasks on the server and prefer the old behavior of canceling only the tasks under the batch job and not all the jobs running, you can turn off the **Enhanced batch abort** feature in the Feature management workspace and try to [abort a batch job](#aborting-tasks-in-a-batch-job) again.
