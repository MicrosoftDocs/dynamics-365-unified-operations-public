# Import or export a customized security configuration by using Data management 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The topic explains how a customized security configuration can be exported and imported across environments by using the [Data management framework](../data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md). This functionality can be used when, for example, a customized security configuration must be moved from a test environment to a production environment.

The following entities hold the customized, role-based security (that is, privileges, duties, and roles) that has been added or modified by using security configuration:

- Security privilege metadata customization entity
- Security duty metadata customization entity
- Security role metadata customization entity

## Export customized security configuration

1. Go to **System administration \> Workspaces \> Data management**.
2. Select the **Export** tile.
3. In the **Group name** field, enter a name for the group.
4. Set the **Generate data package** option to **Yes**.

5. Select **Add multiple** to open the drop-down dialog box.
6. Filter the entities by setting the following fields:

    - In the **Entities** field, enter **Security**.
    - In the **Entity category** field, select **Master**.

7. In the **Target data format** field, select **Excel**.
8. Select the applicable security customization entities.
9. Select **Add selected**.

    In version 10.0.12 and later, ignore any warning messages about data length. Those messages aren't applicable, because the entities that are included use containers in data package mode.

10. Select **Close**.
11. Make sure that the **Sequence** field is set in the order of the entity dependencies. Privileges should be first, then duties, and finally roles.
12. Select **Export**.
13. Select **Close**.
14. Wait for the job to be completed. Select **Refresh** to view the status.
15. Select **Download package**.
16. Save the package.

## Import customized security configuration

1. Go to **System administration \> Workspaces \> Data management**.
2. Select the **Import** tile.
3. In the **Group name** field, enter a name for the group.
4. Select **Add file**.
5. Select **Upload and add**.
6. Find the exported package, and then select **Open**.

    In version 10.0.12 and later, ignore any warning messages about data length. Those messages aren't applicable, because the entities that are included use containers in data package mode.

7. Select **Close**.
8. Select **Import**.
9. Select **Close**.
10. Wait for the job to be completed. Select **Refresh** to view the status.
