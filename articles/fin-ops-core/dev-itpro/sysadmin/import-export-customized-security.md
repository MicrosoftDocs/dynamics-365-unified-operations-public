# Import or export a customized security configuration by using Data management 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The article explains how a customized security configuration can be exported and imported across environments by using the [Data management framework](../data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md). This functionality can be used when, for example, a customized security configuration must be moved from a test environment to a production environment.

The following entities hold the customized, role-based security (that is, privileges, duties, and roles) that has been added or modified by using security configuration:

- Security privilege metadata customization entity
- Security duty metadata customization entity
- Security role metadata customization entity

## Export customized security configuration

1. Go to **System administration \> Workspaces \> Data management**.
2. Select the **Export** tile.
3. In the **Group name** field, enter a name for the group.
4. Set the **Generate data package** option to **Yes**.

5. Select **Add multiple** to open the drop-down dialog box.
6. Filter the entities by setting the following fields:

    - In the **Entities** field, enter **Security**.
    - In the **Entity category** field, select **Master**.

7. In the **Target data format** field, select **Excel**.
8. Select the applicable security customization entities.
9. Select **Add selected**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Ignore any warning messages that have the following format: "The data entity \<Entity name\> has public field XmlObjectFileName that is not defined on the staging table." These messages aren't applicable, because the security entities use containers in the data package to store the security XML object.

10. Select **Close**.
11. Make sure that the **Sequence** field is set in the order of the entity dependencies. Privileges should be first, then duties, and finally roles.
12. Select **Export**.
13. Select **Close**.
14. Wait for the job to be completed. Select **Refresh** to view the status.
15. Select **Download package**.
16. Save the package.

## Import customized security configuration

1. Go to **System administration \> Workspaces \> Data management**.
2. Select the **Import** tile.
3. In the **Group name** field, enter a name for the group.
4. Select **Add file**.
5. Select **Upload and add**.
6. Find the exported package, and then select **Open**.

These messages aren't applicable, because the security entities use containers in the data package to store the security XML object.

7. Select **Close**.
8. Select **Import**.
