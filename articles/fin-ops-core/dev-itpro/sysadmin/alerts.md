# Set up alerts

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Alerts form a notification system for critical events in finance and operations. You can use alerts to stay informed about events that you want to track during the workday. You can set up a set of alert rules so that you're alerted when a batch job ends, ends in error, or is canceled. You can select whether the alerts are emailed to you or appear as notifications in the Action center. Alerts can be set up per batch job and per user.
