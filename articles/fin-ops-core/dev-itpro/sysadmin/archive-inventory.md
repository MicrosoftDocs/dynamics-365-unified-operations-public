# Archive inventory transaction data in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../../../supply-chain/includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to archive data for inventory transactions with Dataverse long term retention.

Currently, users can consolidate and compress the inventory transactions table (InventTrans) and archive the original records in the InventTransArchive table. For more information, see [Archive inventory transactions](../../../supply-chain/inventory/archive-inventory-transactions.md).

The new **Archive with Dataverse long term retention** feature addresses the data volume issue of the InventTrans table and helps improve system performance. It moves InventTransArchive records to a Microsoft Azure data lake and replicates corresponding records to InventTransArchiveHistory in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management for performance optimization.

## Prerequisites

- The **Inventory transactions archive** feature is enabled.
- Inventory transactions are archived from the InventTrans table to the InventTransArchive table.

### Turn on the features in Supply Chain Management

If your system doesn't already include the features, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Feature management**.
2. Enable both the following features:

    - **Inventory transactions archive** – This feature archives inventory transactions from the InventTrans table to the InventTransArchive table.
    - **Archive with Dataverse long term retention** – This feature moves archived inventory transactions from the InventTransArchive table to  Dataverse long term retention and replicates the data to the InventTransArchiveHistory table.

### Considerations before you purge inventory transactions

- The **Reverse** function of the **Inventory transactions archive** feature isn't available for purged inventory transaction records.
- The unpurge activity isn't available from the Dataverse long term retention to Supply Chain Management.

### Archive inventory transactions before you purge

For more information about how to archive inventory transactions, see [Archive inventory transactions](../../../supply-chain/inventory/archive-inventory-transactions.md).

## Schedule the long term retention job

To move InventTransArchive records to the Dataverse long term retention, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Archive with Dataverse long term retention** \> **Inventory transactions**.
1. Select **New long term retention job** to open the **Long term retention job creation** wizard.
1. Enter a name for the job, and then select **Next**.
1. Select the period that was processed by the **Inventory transactions archive** feature, and then select **Next**.
1. Enter the start date and time of the long term retention job, and then select **Next**.
1. Review the job details, and create the long term retention job.

You receive a message that the long term retention job has been created. The archived records are purged on the scheduled date.

## View the status of the long term retention job

To view the results of the long term retention job, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Archive** \> **Inventory transactions**.
1. A list of long  term retention jobs is shown. Select the job where the **Job status** field is set to **Completed**.
1. Under **Results**, select the link.
1. View the **Inventory transactions archive progress** information.
1. Select **View detailed logs** to view the Archive job message log. This log describes the steps of the long term retention job in detail.

## View historical data

When the long term retention job moves archived inventory transactions from the InventTransArchive table to the Dataverse long term retention, the same data is replicated to the InventTransArchiveHistory table. To view the historical data in the InventTransArchiveHistory table, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Workspaces** \> **Archive** \> **Inventory transactions**.
1. A list of long term retention jobs is shown. Select the job where the **Job status** field is set to **Completed**.
1. Select **View historical data** to view the data in the InventTransArchiveHistory table.
