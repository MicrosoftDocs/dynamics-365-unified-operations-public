# Batch capacity 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Batch capacity refers to the maximum number of batch tasks that can be processed at a time. It depends on both the number of batch servers and the number of batch threads available for processing these tasks.

To calculate the batch capacity, multiply the number of batch servers by the number of batch threads per server:

*Batch capacity* = *Number of batch servers* &times; *Number of batch threads per server*

The total batch capacity for the environment is determined based on user licenses. We establish the minimum and maximum number of batch servers required to serve this batch capacity.

To view batch capacity, use **System Administration** \> **Setup** \> **Server configuration** and look for available batch servers.

## Batch auto scaling 

Auto scaling is a new feature that automatically adjusts your batch servers according to resource usage thresholds. It provides elasticity to your environment, allowing it to adapt to varying workloads dynamically. This process is entirely automated and relies on predefined signals based on CPU and memory usage of batch servers.

Auto scaling becomes beneficial when the workload on an environment fluctuates over time. We continuously monitor the reported load and periodically evaluate triggers to determine if scaling is necessary.

The lower load threshold signifies the point at which the service scales in. If the average load falls below this threshold, the service scales in.

Conversely, the upper load threshold indicates when the service scales out. If the average load exceeds this threshold, the service scales out.

> [!NOTE]
> - For batch auto scaling to work, your environment should have [batch priority-based scheduling](priority-based-batch-scheduling.md) enabled, and your PU should be 10.0.26 (PU 50) or higher.
> - After batch auto scaling is activated for the environment, the platform periodically adjusts the thread count for each server as per batch capacity. Any manual alterations to the thread count are disregarded and overridden by the platform's automated processes.

For example, where your environment comprises six batch servers, each with eight threads, totaling 48 batch threads. 

If your environment encounters elevated CPU and memory usage on batch servers, the platform might introduce another batch server while decreasing the thread count per server to seven. This action ensures that even with seven batch servers, the total thread count remains consistent at 49, closely aligning with the initial count of 48.

Conversely, when batch server CPU and memory utilization are low, platform might opt to remove two servers while increasing the thread count per server to 12, maintaining a total of 48 threads.

This approach ensures that the total active threads for your environment remain constant while optimizing the number of batch servers, thus ensuring appropriate allocation of infrastructure resources. 

## Batch Thread Update
The goal of autoscale is to scale up or down the number of servers the environment has based on defined metrics. Currently we have two metrics, namely CPU and Memory usage, which decide the Autoscale criteria. However, it was recently pointed out that Autoscale doesn't consider batch thread saturation.

For example, The customer wants to run 500-K tasks in 5 hrs. Looking at the following table, the customer won't be able to complete the tasks in the target time of 5 hrs for which they had configured the thread count post autoscale. Autoscale wouldn't trigger since there's no memory/CPU spike.

| Scenario | Server Count | Threads/Server | Total Tasks | Time/Task | Total Time
|----------|--------|--------- |-----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Before Autoscale | 10 | 14 | 500k | 5 s  | 4.96 Hrs |
| After Autoscale | 8 | 14 | 500k | 5 s    | 6.2 Hrs  |

As per Proposed solution, When we increase or decrease the number of servers for the given environment that should have constant number of threads distributed equally across the server.
We should calculate the total number of threads an environment can have as following:

*Total number of threads* = *Number of batch servers* &times; *Number of batch threads per server*

This total number of threads should remain the same whenever we do scale up or scale down.
During initialization, we would keep the default number of threads each server can have. 

Letâ€™s take this default value as 8, for example,  following

1. If an environment has four batch servers with eight threads each

Total number of threads = 8 x 4 = 32

If we scale down the environment from 4 to 2 servers, then each server will get 32/2 = 16 threads.
Lets say if we scale up the environment again from 2 to 3, each server should get 32/3 = 11 threads.

2. If a customer has max server defined as 4 but they have more threads count currently let's say 16. Then according to above logic

Total number of threads the customer has = 4 x 16 = 64

Expected number of servers based on new logic = 64/ Default thread count (8) = 8

So, we'll give them four extra servers initially and we expect Autoscale to scale it down appropriately to reduce this number later.

> [!NOTE] 
> - We'll limit the number of batch threads per server to a maximum of 16 to prevent overloading the server cores.
> - We need to take away the capability to adjust the thread count from customers. It doesn't make sense anyways to keep this capability considering in PBS, it's going to be universal for all batch servers.

Using above approach, we can ensure that our system is optimized for performance and scalability. This approach simplifies our system and reduces costs by removing another metrics and scaling rules.

## How to increase batch capacity

To increase the batch capacity in a production environment, you must acquire more user licenses and update subscription estimates in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services. For updated user licenses, we automatically increase the batch capacity by adjusting the thread count per existing server. The platform adds more batch servers after the existing batch servers reach their threshold limits for CPU and memory using.

To increase the batch capacity in a sandbox environment, you need a Tier-4 or Tier-5 sandbox. This action isn't possible in Tier-2 or Tier-3 sandboxes.
