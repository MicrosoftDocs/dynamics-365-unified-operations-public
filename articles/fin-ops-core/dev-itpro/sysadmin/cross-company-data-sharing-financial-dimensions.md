# Cross-company data sharing for financial dimensions

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In limited scenarios, default dimension fields can be shared by using cross-company data sharing. This article explains when those fields can be shared.

Learn more in [Cross-company data sharing overview](srs-overview.md).

## Backing tables that can be used by financial dimensions

Financial dimensions use the values from various tables in the system. These tables are known as *backing tables*. Backing tables can store data either globally or per company. If they store the data globally, all records are accessible, regardless of the company that you view the data from.

The following backing tables are included out of the box and can be used by financial dimensions.

| Global dimensions | Nonglobal dimensions |
|-------------------|----------------------|

## Sharing default dimensions

Default dimension fields can be shared through data sharing policies only if all dimensions in the system are global. If any nonglobal dimension exists, the field can't be shared.

### After a default dimension field is shared

After the policy is enabled with a shared default dimension field, you can't create new nonglobal dimensions in the system. However, you can continue to create new global dimensions.

## FAQ

**If I use Master record sharing or Single record sharing feature (SRS) to share a table across all companies, can a dimension be changed from nonglobal to global?**

No. The list is static. Even if you share a custom table by using SRS, and you try to "make it global," the table remains nonglobal. The system uses metadata that is defined in the table itself to determine whether that table is global or nonglobal.

**Can I disable sharing of a default dimension field?**

Master company sharing policies can't be disabled. This rule applies to fields that are shared on tables in the policy.
