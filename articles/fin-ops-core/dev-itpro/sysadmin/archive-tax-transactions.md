<!-- Preview until further notice -->

As tax transaction data expands, it takes up more database space and gradually slows down queries. This article explains how to use a tax transactions archive to help enhance system performance.

When you archive tax transactions, data from the following tables is moved to history tables:

- `TaxTrans`
- `TaxTrans_BR`
- `TaxTrans_IN`
- `TaxTrans_IT`
- `TaxTrans_RU`
- `TaxTrans_W`
- `TaxTransExtensionTH`
- `TaxTransGeneralJournalAccountEntry`
- `TaxTransSubledgerJournalAccountEntry`
- `TaxTrans_Reporting`

## Prerequisites

Before you use this feature, the following prerequisites must be met:

- You must be running version 10.0.35 or later of finance and operations apps.
- The data archive micro-service must be installed on your system from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services. For more information, see [Install the Archive add-in from Lifecycle Services](archive-setup.md#install-addin).
- The following features must be turned on in [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). For more information, see [Enable the features that you need](archive-setup.md#enable-features).

## Schedule archiving of tax transactions

To schedule archiving of tax transactions, follow these steps.

1. Go to **System administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Archive**.
2. In the **Archive** workspace, on the Action Pane, select **Archive**.
3. In the drop-down dialog box, in the name field, select **TaxArchiveAutomation**, and then select **Archive** to apply your setting and close the dialog box.
4. On the **Create new process automation** page, on the **General** tab, set the **Name** field to define the name of the archive. Set the **Schedule time** field to define when the archive job should start to run. You can also specify how often the archive job should run. If you decide to set up multiple occurrences, set the **End time** field to limit the amount of time that an archive job runs during a day. Any archive job that doesn't finish running within that time limit is paused and picked up during the next occurrence. You can also set up alerts as required.
5. Select **Next** to continue.
6. On the **Tax archive automation parameters** page, view the list of record collections that are ready for archiving.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Archive status** field is set to **Ready** when all periods in the fiscal year are _permanently_ closed.

7. Select the record collection that you want to archive, and then select **Finish**.

You're returned to the **Archive** workspace, which now shows the archive job that you just created. The **Archive status** field of this job is set to **Scheduled**. The job will run at the scheduled time.

## Review the progress and log of an archive job

To review the progress and log of an archive job, follow these steps.

1. Go to **System administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Archive**.
2. In the **Archive** workspace, on the **Tax transactions archive** tab, in the **Fiscal calendar** field, select the fiscal calendar that you want to inspect.
3. In the grid, select the archive job that you want to inspect. Then select **View results**.

## Review historical tax transaction data

To review the historical tax transactions data, go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Sales tax inquiries** \> **Posted sales tax history**.

## Reverse a tax transactions archive

When you reverse an archive, the system moves records of that archive from the history tables back to the live tables. This operation is useful if you must edit an archived transaction, because you can't edit records in the history tables. To reverse an archive, follow these steps.

1. Go to **System administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Archive**.
2. In the **Archive** workspace, on the **Tax transactions archive** tab, the grid lists your existing archives. Select the archive that you want to reverse, and then select **Reverse**.
3. In the **Reverse** dialog box, schedule the reversal job by setting the **Reversal start time** field and then selecting **OK**.
4. A message prompts you to confirm the operation. Select **OK** to confirm it.
