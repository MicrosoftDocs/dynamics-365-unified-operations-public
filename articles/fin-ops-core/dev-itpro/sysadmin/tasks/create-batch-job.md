# Create a batch job

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

A batch job is a group of tasks that are submitted to an Application Object Server (AOS) instance for automatic processing. Batch jobs are run by using the security credentials of the user who created the job. Use the following procedure to create a batch job. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.


## Create the batch job
1. Go to **Navigation pane > Modules > System administration > Inquiries > Batch jobs**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Job description** field, enter a description of the batch job.
4. In the **Scheduled start date/time** field, enter the date and time when the batch job should run.
5. Select **Save**.

## Create a recurrence
1. On the Action Pane, select **Batch job**.
2. Select **Recurrence**. Use these options to enter a range and pattern for the recurrence.  
3. Select **OK**.

## Add alerts
1. On the Action Pane, select **Batch job**.
2. Select **Alerts**. Indicate if you want alert messages sent when the batch job ends, has an error, or is canceled. Then specify if you want the alerts to be displayed as pop-up messages.   
3. Select **OK**.

## Add a task to a batch job
1.	On the **Batch jobs** page, select **View tasks**.
2.	Select **Ctrl+N** to create a task.
3.	Enter a description of the batch task.
4.	In the **Company accounts** field, select the company database that the task should run in.
5.	In the **Class name** field, select the process that the task should run. 
6.	As appropriate, select a batch group for the task.

    Client tasks must be assigned to a batch group. They are automatically assigned to the default batch group (also known as the Empty batch group).

7.	Select **Ctrl+S** to save the task.
8.	To make the selected task dependent on another task in the job, select the **Has conditions** grid, and then follow these steps for each condition that you want to define:

    1. Select **Ctrl+N** to create a condition.
    2. Select the task ID of the parent task.
    3. Select the status that the parent task must reach before the dependent task can run.
    4. Select **Ctrl+S** to save the condition.

    If you define more than one condition, and if *all* the conditions must be met before the dependent task can run, select a condition type of **All**. If the dependent task can run after *any* of the conditions has been met, select a condition type of **Any**.

9.	Select how task failures should be handled. To ignore the failure of a specific task, on the **General** tab, select the **Ignore task failure** option for that task. If this option is selected, failure of the task won't cause the job to fail. You can also use the **Maximum retries** field to specify the number of times that a task should be retried before it's considered to have failed. As a best practice, we recommend that you not set the **Maximum retries** field to a value that is more than **5**.

    For more information about batch retries, see [Enable batch retries](../retryable-batch.md).

## Adjust batch job status
1. Go to **System administration > Inquiries > Batch jobs**.
2. Select the appropriate batch job.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Batch job > Functions > Change status**.
4. Select the appropriate status:
    - **Withhold**: Set the batch job as **withhold** so it is withheld from the batch job scheduler. Equivalent to *stop*.
    - **Waiting**: Set the batch job as **waiting** so it is waiting to be picked up by the batch job scheduler. Equivalent to *go*.
5. Select **OK**.
