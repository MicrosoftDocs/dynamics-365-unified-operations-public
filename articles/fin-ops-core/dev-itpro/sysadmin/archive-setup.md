## <a name="enable-features"></a>Enable the features that you need

After you install the *(Preview) Archive* add-in from Lifecycle Services, you can enable the archiving features that you need. Use the [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace to enable the following features as you require:

- *(Preview) Archive* – This feature is required for all archiving scenarios. It provides basic archiving support and adds the **Archive** workspace.
- *(Preview) Ledger archive automation* – This feature moves general ledger records to the relevant history tables. After the data is copied to the history tables, the matching data from the day-to-day general ledger tables is purged. For more information about how to use this feature, see [Archive general ledger data](archive-general-ledger.md).
- *(Preview) Archive sales orders to history tables* – This feature is required for archiving of sales orders. It provides a framework for moving sales orders from day-to-day transaction tables to local history tables. For more information about how to use this feature, see [Archive sales orders](archive-sales-orders.md).
- *(Preview) Archive sales orders to history tables using archive service* – This feature is required for archiving of sales orders.
