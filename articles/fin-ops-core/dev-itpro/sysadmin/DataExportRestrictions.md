# Execution restrictions for specific data export projects

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Some data export projects have been restricted from execution in Finance and Operations environments that run version 10.0.22 or earlier.

If you receive the following error message, you must update the environment to a supported version:

> This data export project is no longer supported for execution. To run this project, it is first required to update the environment to a supported version.

If you don't update the environment to a supported version, you won't be able to run some data projects.

For more information about supported versions, see [Service update availability](../../fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases.md).

We plan to add more information to this article at a later time.
