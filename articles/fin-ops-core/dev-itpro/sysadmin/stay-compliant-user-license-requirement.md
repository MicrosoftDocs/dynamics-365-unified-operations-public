# Stay compliant with user licensing requirements

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides an overview of how customers can stay compliant with the user licensing requirements for finance and operations apps. These apps include Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, and Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The licensing requirements for users are determined by the security roles that are assigned to enabled users. Security roles are built based on a hierarchy of the following elements:

- Subroles
- Duties
- Privileges
- Directly referenced securable objects

For more information, see [Role-based security](./role-based-security.md).

The licensing requirements for users are determined at the organization or tenant level. This article is focused on the requirements for a single environment. If you have multiple environments, the requirements must be analyzed across all of them.

A licensing requirement is assigned to every securable object or resource that's included in a user role.

The rest of this article describes the different tools that you can use to ensure that the actual licensing complies with the expected licensing requirements. The first thing to verify is that the user roles have the expected licensing requirements and are assigned to the appropriate users. 

For more information about security role to duty and privilege mapping that aligns to Microsoftâ€™s licensing policy and to understand the licenses you need, see [User Security Governance](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/sysadmin/security-gov-overview).

## Available and assigned licenses

You can view available and assigned licenses under **Licenses** in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## License requirement per role

The **Assign roles to user** dialog box that's opened from the **System Administration** \> **Security** \> **Users** page can help you understand the impact on user licensing when roles are assigned. You can also use it to get an overview of the licensing requirements for each role. You can use the dialog box itself or export data to Excel for further analysis. Custom roles can require licenses for more than one application.

If a role has unexpected licensing requirements, you can use the **User Security Governance** workspace to understand what security roles and respective permissions are driving the requirements.

## Licensing requirements using User Security Governance

Use the **User license summary** page in the **User security governance** to understand how security roles and respective permissions define the license requirements across their Dynamics 365 finance and operations environment.

To access the **User License Summary** page, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 finance and operations.
2. Go to **System administration > Security > Security Governance > License usage summary**.

The User security governance license usage summary page provides a layered view of:
- How system permissions are exercised
- How responsibilities map to different role types

These details enable deeper visibility into user access patterns and ensure that roles align with intended responsibilities.

## Users per role

You can use the **System Administration** \> **Security** \> **Assign users to role** page to view all users who are assigned a specific role.

## Enabled users

For internal security and to help avoid licensing requirements for users who have left or aren't actively using the finance and operations apps, we recommend that you disable those users on the **Users** page.

> [!NOTE]
>  The System Administrator role is a special role in finance and operations apps that grants users full access to manage system artifacts. Users assigned to this role cannot be restricted or modified by other roles and are exempt from licensing requirements. This means that individuals with this role don't need to purchase additional licenses to configure and administer Dynamics 365 applications.



## Audit and Monitor
Regularly audit your current security settings and monitor the system postupdate to ensure compliance with the licensing requirements.

## Additional resources

For information about how to buy and license finance and operations apps, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&amp;clcid=0x409).

For information about how to assign licenses to users in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

More user licenses are required when multiple implementation projects exist for the same tenant. For more information, see [Multiple Lifecycle Services projects and production environments on one Microsoft Entra tenant](../../fin-ops/get-started/implement-multiple-projects-aad-tenant.md#licensing-requirements).
