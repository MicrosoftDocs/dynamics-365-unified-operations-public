# License codes and configuration keys report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article points you to a report that lists the license codes and configuration keys available in finance and operations.

When you purchase finance and operations, you get all functionality. By default, some features and functionality that you don't use might be enabled. The administrator should disable the features that aren't needed by disabling license codes and configuration keys.

When you disable a license code or configuration key, you remove the associated module or feature from the user interface. License codes control large sets of functionality, such as modules. Many license codes enable configuration keys that let you enable and disable functionality at a more detailed level.

## To view the report

The **License codes and configuration keys report**, included with the [Technical reference reports](/dynamics/s-e/global/axtechrefrep_61), lists each available configuration key. The report also shows the license code and menu items associated with each configuration key.
