# Enable batch retries

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how retries are implemented on batch jobs in Finance and Operations apps, and how you can enable automatic retries on batch jobs when transient failures occur. Currently, the batch platform provides three ways to enable batch resiliency and prevent transient failures.

## Retry the batch job task, regardless of the error type

We recommended that you use this option when you want a batch job task always to be retried, regardless of the error type. The **Maximum retries** value specifies the number of retries that will be applied to a task, regardless of the type of exception that occurs. If a task fails, the batch platform evaluates the number of times that it has been retried. If the number is less than the value of **Maximum retries**, the task is put back into a ready state so that it can be picked up again. 

1. On the **Batch jobs** page, select **Batch task details**.
2. On the **General** tab, set the **Maximum retries** field.

## Retry the batch job task when transient SQL Server errors occur

Currently, if Finance and Operations apps experience a brief loss of connection to Microsoft SQL Server, all batch jobs that are running fail. This behavior disrupts business processes. Because connection loss is inevitable in a cloud service, Microsoft enables automated retries when failures of this type occur.

By default, all batch classes that are idempotent and produce the same results even after multiple runs are retryable. You can set an idempotency flag in the batch class instance by using **classinstance.BatchInfo().parmIdempotent(boolean)**. 

Because not all batch jobs might be idempotent (for example, when a batch runs credit card transactions), retries can't be enabled equally across all batch jobs. To help ensure that retries can be safely enabled, Microsoft has added metadata to the batch jobs to indicate whether they can automatically be retried. Between versions 10.0.18 and 10.0.19, more than 90 percent of the Microsoft batch jobs have explicitly implemented the **BatchRetryable** interface, and the **isRetryable** value has been set appropriately. For any jobs where the **BatchRetryable** interface isn't implemented, the default value of **isRetryable** is **False**.

Retries are enabled only for jobs where the **BatchRetryable** interface is implemented and **isRetryable** is set to **True**. In this functionality, retries occur after any interruption of the SQL Server connection. Microsoft will continue to add retries on other exceptions.

Precedence for the retryable flag for a class evaluation is in the following order: the **isIdempotent** flag, the batch class override configuration, and the **isRetryable** flag. 

1. If the **isIdempotent** flag is **True**, the task will be retried, regardless of the other two flags. 
2. If the **isIdempotent** is **False**, and the batch class override configuration is **True**, the task will be retried. If the batch class override configuration is **False**, the task won't be retried, because that value is an override value.
3. If the **isIdempotent** flag is **False**, and the batch class override configuration isn't implemented, the **isRetryable** flag is evaluated. If the value is **True**, the task will be retried. If it's **False**, the task won't be retried.

The maximum number of retries and the retry interval are controlled by the batch platform. The **BatchRetryable** interface starts after five seconds and stops retrying after the interval time reaches five minutes. (Interval time increases in the following way: 5, 8, 16, 32, and so on.)

> [!NOTE]
> For SQL transient errors, the batch platform will retry the task if the exception that is thrown from the customer class is an exception of the **TransientSqlConnectionError** type, or if **TransientSqlConnectionError** can be wrapped as a nested exception inside a custom exception and thrown.

## Batch OData action capability

This option isn't a direct execution retry like the previous two options. It enables the customer to add custom logic before the job is retriggered. When job execution fails, you can listen to corresponding business events and decide whether the failure can be retried. The batch platform has exposed a new Open Data Protocol (OData) action from version 10.0.22 (with Platform update 46). When a job ID is provided in a call to the endpoint, the job will be requeued for execution.

For more information, see [Batch OData API](batch-odata-api.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### How do retries work for my custom batch jobs?

There is no change to the custom batch jobs. To take advantage of automated retries, explicitly implement the **BatchRetryable** interface on the custom batch jobs, and set **isRetryable** to **true**. Note that you might have to modify the batch jobs to ensure that they are safe to retry.

### How do I implement the retryable interface?

Add the following code to your batch class.

For more information, see [Final methods and the Wrappable attribute](../extensibility/method-wrapping-coc.md).

```
//RunBaseBatch
class TestBatchJob extends RunBaseBatch implements BatchRetryable
{
    [Wrappable(true), Replaceable(true)] // Change to meet your customizability requirements
    public boolean isRetryable() // Use final if you want to prevent overriding
    {
        return false; // You can also use true if you want to enforce retryable behavior
    }
    ...
} 

//SysOperationServiceController 
class TestBatchJob extends SysOperationServiceController implements BatchRetryable
{
    [Wrappable(true), Replaceable(true)] // Change to meet your customizability requirements
    public boolean isRetryable() // Use final if you want to prevent overriding
    {
        return false; // You can also use true if you want to enforce retryable behavior
    }
    ...
}
```

### I am extending a Microsoft batch that is retryable, but my batch job isn't retryable. Will the retry be triggered?

Provided that **isRetryable** is set to **false** for the extended job, the job won't be retried.

### I mistakenly marked my custom job as retryable. Can I override without taking another code change?

Yes. You can go to **System administration \> Setup \> Batch class configuration overrides** to unregister your class from being retried when SQL Server connection failures occur, without having to go through a code change. On the **Batch class configuration overrides** page, you must create a new record and add the batch class that you want to unregister. You can use this feature to react quickly to changes that are required. The best practice recommendation is to make sure that the code is updated.

### My batch jobs are designed to run multithreaded. How do I implement retries?

If your custom batch process is designed to run in multithreading (that is, if you're creating multiple tasks and adding runtime tasks), you must implement the **BatchRetryable** interface in both the main controller and the task controller.

### What is the best practice for the execution time for a batch job?

A batch job that has a shorter execution time is more likely to be successfully completed. Therefore, the need for a retry is avoided.

### What is the best practice for the transaction size for a batch job?

A batch job that has a smaller transaction size reduces the amount of work that can be lost because of a transient failure. Therefore, the need for a retry won't drastically increase the total execution time.

### What does idempotent mean for a batch job?

In this context, *idempotent* means that a retry won't change or affect the overall result. For example, something should be done only one time and won't be done more than one time. Therefore, something that is done in the original run won't be done again during the retry.

### Can I change the maximum number of retries and the retry interval?

The **BatchRetryable** interface enables transient SQL connection issues to be handled. It's mainly controlled by the framework. Customers can't update settings for **BatchRetryable**, such as the maximum number of retries and the retry interval.
