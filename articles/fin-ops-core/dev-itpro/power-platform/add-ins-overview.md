# Add-ins overview

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Add-ins provide a way to extend the functionality of Finance and Operations apps. The following topics provide some examples of add-ins:

- [Planning Optimization overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/supply-chain/master-planning/planning-optimization/planning-optimization-overview)
- [Inventory Visibility Add-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/supply-chain/inventory/inventory-visibility)
- [Configure export to Azure Data Lake](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/configure-export-data-lake)
- [IoT Intelligence home page](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/supply-chain/iot/iot-intelligence-home-page)

## Prerequisites for setting up add-ins

- Make sure that at least 1 gigabyte (GB) of Microsoft Dataverse space is available. Otherwise, setup will fail. You can view your capacity in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/resources/capacity). 
- Identify your Finance and Operations environment administrator. You can find that information in the **Environment details** section.

- Validate your Power Platform environment governance policy. To validate, you must be a **Global administrator** or **Power Platform administrator**.
    
    1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
    2. Select the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Power Platform site.

- For organizations that do not allow **Everyone** to create Power Platform production environments, the Finance and Operations environment administrator account must be added as the admin.
    
    The Finance and Operations environment administrator must be added to one of the following roles. You will need a Global Administrator to perform this action.
    - Global admins
    - Dynamics 365 admins
    - Power Platform admins
    
    For more information, see [Use service admin roles to manage your tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant).

## Set up add-ins

> [!NOTE]
> If the add-ins that you're planning to install don't require "dual-write linking," you don't have to complete this procedure.

1. After the Finance and Operations environment has been deployed through LCS, open the **Environment details** page in LCS.
2. In the **Power Platform integration** section, select **Setup**.
3. In the **Power platform environment setup** dialog box, select the check box, and then select **Setup** at the bottom of the dialog box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Dataverse environment is set up so that it includes dual-write functionality. Typically, this setup consumes about 1 GB of Dataverse space.

4. When you receive a message that states that the Microsoft Power Platform environment is being provisioned, select **OK**.

    The **Power Platform integration** section of the **Environment details** page now shows a message that states that the Microsoft Power Platform environment is being provisioned.

5. After a few minutes, refresh the **Environment details** page.
6. In the **Power Platform integration** section, notice that the value of the **Status** field is **Environment setup is in progress**.

    Typically, the setup takes between 60 and 90 minutes.

    After the Dataverse environment is provisioned, the **Install a new add-in** button becomes available in the **Power Platform integration** section.

## Troubleshoot the setup

- Because the setup process tries to set up dual-write functionality, the dual-write setup might sometimes fail after the Dataverse environment is provisioned, as shown in the following illustration. In these cases, the **Install a new add-in** button is still available, so that you can unblock the installation of add-ins. If you want to continue to set up dual-write functionality, select **Resume**.

- Provisioning of the Dataverse environment might sometimes fail because of capacity and licensing issues. In these cases, sign in to the Power Platform admin center, and fix the issues. Then, in the **Power Platform integration** section of the **Environment details** page in LCS, select **Resume**.
