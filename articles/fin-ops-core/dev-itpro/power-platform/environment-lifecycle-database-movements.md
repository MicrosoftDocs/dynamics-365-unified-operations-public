# Database and environment movements when Power Platform Integration is enabled

When Microsoft Power Platform Integration is enabled, the finance and operations apps environment and the customer engagements apps environment are tightly connected. Administrators should regard these two platforms as one environment that has multiple apps. This article describes the environment lifecycle scenarios that are affected by Power Platform Integration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - We recommend that you perform the activities that are described in this article in parallel on both platforms. To find terminology that's specific to each platform, see [Environment lifecycle operations - Core concepts](environment-lifecycle-core-concepts.md).
> - Power Platform Integration isn't affected by the environment lifecycle scenarios that are described in this article, except when the environments are deleted.

## Environment actions available in Power Platform admin center

This section describes the environment actions that are available in Power Platform admin center.

### Back up environments

The procedure for backing up environments in Microsoft Power Platform doesn't change for connected environments. Remember that both code and data are backed up in Microsoft Power Platform. Only the database is backed up for finance and operations apps. For more information about how to back up Microsoft Power Platform, see [Back up and restore environments](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments).

### Restore environments

You can use Microsoft Power Platform to [restore a system backup](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments#restore-a-system-backup) or do a [manual backup](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments#manual-backups), which restores both code and the database into the environment. For more information, see the [Considerations before and after database and environment movements](#considerations-before-and-after-database-and-environment-movements) section of this article.

### Copy environments

You can use Microsoft Power Platform to [copy an environment](/power-platform/admin/copy-environment). For more information, see the [Considerations before and after database and environment movements](#considerations-before-and-after-database-and-environment-movements) section of this article.

## Environment actions available in Lifecycle Services

This section describes the environment actions that are available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services.

### Export a database

The procedure for using Lifecycle Services to export a database doesn't change for connected environments. Remember that only the database is backed up for finance and operations apps, whereas both code and data are backed up in Microsoft Power Platform. For more information about how to export a database, see [Export a database](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/database/export-database).

> [!NOTE]
> Perform manual backups at the same time for both platforms.

### Do a point-in-time restore

You can use Lifecycle Services to do a [database point-in-time restore (PITR)](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/database/database-point-in-time-restore).

> [!NOTE] 
> To ensure data consistency, perform the restores in parallel for both platforms, and choose the same point in time value.

### Refresh a database

You can use Lifecycle Services to [refresh a database](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/database/database-refresh) from another environment or [import a database](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/database/import-database) from the Lifecycle Services Asset library.

> [!NOTE]
> Perform the copy and database refreshes in parallel when both the source environments and the target environments are linked.

## Considerations before and after database and environment movements

- Some add-ins might require cleanup before a database restore. Carefully review the documentation that's specific to the add-ins that you're using.
- After the database and environment movements, environment administrators must ensure that the target environments on both platforms are aligned from a code perspective:

    - **Option 1:** After a restore or copy activity, redeploy, in Dataverse, the solutions before the restore or copy activity.
    - **Option 2:** Redeploy, to the finance and operations apps environment, either the code package that corresponds to the time of the PITR or the code package in the source environment for database refreshes.

- The copy and database movement activities might affect the [dual-write](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-home-page), [virtual entities](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/virtual-entities-overview), and [business and data events](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/business-events/home-page) frameworks. Carefully review their documentation, and always test the steps in a sandbox before you apply them to production.
