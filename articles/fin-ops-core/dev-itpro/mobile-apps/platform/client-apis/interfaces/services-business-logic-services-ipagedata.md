getControlValue(controlName: string): any

Gets the value of a control directly from the data set loaded in the page.
The "value" is loosely defined across all different types of controls
and generally indicates the primary single field value displayed or interacted with the control. Some complex controls (e.g a lookup or a list)
may not have a simple value and thus cannot be accessed via this API.

#### Returns any

### setControlValue
