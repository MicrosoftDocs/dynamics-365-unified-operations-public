3. In the **Migration group** form, select the migration group to export, and then click **Export now**.
4. In the **Export data** form, select the **Import package in target** check box, and then click **OK**.

## Finance and Operations
You can import data for migration by using your Finance and Operations environment. Follow these steps.

1. Sign in to your environment by using an Administrator role.
2. On the dashboard, select the **Data Management** workspace.
3. Select **Import**.
