# Upgrades, updates, and hotfixes resources

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Upgrades, updates, and hotfixes can include moving to new product versions, code migration and upgrade, moving to an update, or deploying a hotfix. 

The processes for each type of upgrade are similar, but different enough that we think that you should review the topics for a specific task before you begin.

## Upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 to finance and operations

To get started, review the following topics:

- [Upgrade from AX 2012 to finance and operations](upgrade-overview-2012.md)

- [Prepare to migrate code to finance and operations](prepare-migration.md)

## Migration from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 to finance and operations
This Tech Talk video provides an introduction to migration from AX 2009 to finance and operations: [Dynamics 365 for Operations – Tech Talk: Migration tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdQ58arACP4).

## Upgrade from a previous version of finance and operations

The steps for applying updates and upgrading differ between cloud and on-premises implementations. 

### Cloud
If you are upgrading a cloud version of finance and operations, review the following topics:

- [Process for moving to the latest update of finance and operations](upgrade-latest-update.md)

- [Download updates from Lifecycle Services (LCS)](download-hotfix-lcs.md)


### On-premises

- [Apply updates to on-premises deployments](../deployment/apply-updates-on-premises.md)
- [Redeploy on-premises environments](../deployment/redeploy-on-prem.md)

## Hotfixes
