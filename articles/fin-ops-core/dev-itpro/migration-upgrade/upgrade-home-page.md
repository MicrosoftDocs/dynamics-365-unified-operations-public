# Upgrades, updates, and hotfixes resources

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Upgrades, updates, and hotfixes can include moving to new product versions, code migration and upgrade, moving to an update, or deploying a hotfix. 

The processes for each type of upgrade are similar, but different enough that we think that you should review the topics for a specific task before you begin.

## Upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 to Finance and Operations

To get started, review the following topics:

- [Upgrade from AX 2012 to Finance and Operations](upgrade-overview-2012.md)

- [Prepare to migrate code to Finance and Operations](prepare-migration.md)
