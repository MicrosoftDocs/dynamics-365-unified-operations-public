| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The legacy behavior for default actions in grids results in an unexpected column having the default action link after grid columns have been reordered via personalization. The new sticky default action feature corrects this. For more details, see [Sticky default actions in grids](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/October18/dynamics365-finance-operations/sticky-default-action). |

| **Product areas affected**         | Web client |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: Starting in April 2020, the improved "is one of" experience will be the default behavior, without a mechanism to revert to the legacy behavior. |

### Parameter to enable sales orders with multiple project contract funding sources
Support for creating project-based sales orders where the project contract has multiple funding sources is enabled with the **Project management parameters** setting **Allow sales orders for project with multiple funding sources**. By default, this parameter is not enabled. 

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The functionality will always be enabled after the parameter is removed. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No. The functionality to support project-based sales orders with multiple funding sources will always be enabled.   |
| **Product areas affected**         |The **Allow sales orders for projects with multiple funding sources** parameter will be removed. The following methods will be modified when the parameter is removed: **ctrlSalesOrderTable** method in **ProjStatusType** class, **validate** method for **ProjId** field, and **run** method in **SalescreateOrder** form.

## Finance and Operations 10.0.1 with Platform update 25

### Deprecated APIs and potential breaking changes


#### Deriving from internal classes is deprecated

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Before Platform update 25, it was possible to create a class or table that derives from an internal class/table that is defined in another package/module. This is not a safe coding practice. As of Platform update 25, the compiler will display a warning. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | The compiler warning will be replaced by an error in Platform update 26. This change is backward compatible at runtime, which means that Platform update 25 or newer can be deployed on any sandbox or production environment without the need to modify custom code. This change only affects development and compile time.|
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio development tools |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: The warning will become a compilation error in Platform update 26. |

#### Overriding internal methods is deprecated

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Before Platform update 25, it was possible to override an internal method in a derived class that is defined in another package/module. This is not a safe coding practice. As of Platform update 25, the compiler will display a warning. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | This warning will be replaced by a compile error in Platform update 26. This change is backward compatible at runtime, which means that Platform update 25 or newer can be deployed on any sandbox or production environment without the need to modify custom code. This change only affects development and compile time. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio development tools |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: The warning will become a compilation error in Platform update 26. |

## Finance and Operations 10.0.0 with Platform update 24

### Renaming released products 
|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | When you use the **Rename primary key** function to change the ItemId of a released product, only direct foreign key references are updated. Any other references to the released product, such as from production orders, will retain the old ItemId. As a result, there could be inconsistent data that will eventually block business processes. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Product information management |
| **Deployment option**              | All  |
| **Status**                         | Removed as of Finance and Operations 10.0.0 with Platform update 24. (If and only if you need to repair data corruption caused by a previous rename of the primary key of a released product, please contact Microsoft Support to request temporary removal of this restriction.) |


## Finance and Operations 8.1.3 with Platform update 23

### SQL Server Reporting Services ReportViewer Control
Customers can use the **Export** action provided by the embedded SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) ReportViewer control to download documents produced by Finance and Operations applications. This HTML-based presentation of the report offers users a non-paginated preview of the document.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The non-paginated nature of the HTML-based preview experience does **not** deliver fidelity with the physical documents ultimately produced by Finance and Operations. By fully embracing PDF as the standard format for business documents, users are able to take advantage of a modern viewing experience with improved performance when producing application reports. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Going forward, PDF documents will be the default format for reports rendered by Finance and Operations.   |
| **Product areas affected**         | This change does **not** impact customer scenarios where reports are distributed electronically or sent directly to printers.    |
| **Deployment option**              | All  |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: A removal date has not been set for this feature. The functionality to automatically preview application reports using an embedded PDF viewer is planned for the May 2019 Platform update. |

### Client KPI controls
Embedded key performance indicators (KPIs) could be modeled in Visual Studio by a developer and further customized by the end user.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The native client controls used to define KPIs have low customer uptake and rely on a developer to add trackable metrics. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | PowerBI.com service delivers world-class tooling for defining and managing KPIs based on data from external sources.  In an upcoming release, we plan to enable you to embed solutions hosted on PowerBI.com in application workspaces.   |
| **Product areas affected**         | This update will prevent developers from introducing new KPI controls in Visual Studio designer.    |
| **Deployment option**              | All  |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: A removal date has not been set for this feature. |

### Deprecated APIs and future breaking changes

#### Field groups containing invalid field references

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | It is possible for table metadata definitions to have field groups containing invalid field references. This issue is currently categorized as a *compiler warning* rather than an *error*, meaning that the deployable package creation and deployment can proceed without fixing the issue. If deployed, this can cause runtime failures in Financial Reporting and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). To fix this issue:<br><br>1. Remove the invalid field reference from the table field group definition.<br><br>2. Recompile.<br><br>3. Ensure any warnings or errors are addressed. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | This warning will be replaced by a compile error in the future.  |
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio development tools. |
| **Deployment option**              | All. |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: The warning will become a compile-time error in the future. We're currently targeting Platform update 30. |

#### Complete list
To access the full list of APIs that are being deprecated, see [Deprecation of methods and metadata elements](deprecation-deletion-apis.md).

## Finance and Operations 8.1 with Platform update 20

## Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3 with Platform update 12

### Personalized product recommendations 
Starting February 15, 2018, retailers will no longer be able to display personalized product recommendations on a point of sale (POS) device. For more information, see [Product recommendations overview](../../../commerce/product-recommendations.md).  

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | We are removing the current version of the product recommendation service as we redesign this feature with a better algorithm and newer retail-oriented capabilities.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No. However, after Spring 2018, we plan to bring back this feature to leverage a new recommendation service.   |
| **Product areas affected**         | Personalized product recommendations in POS.                                                    |
| **Deployment option**              | All                                                                                      |

### Extension of the list of Electronic reporting (ER) functions
The possibility to introduce custom functions to be used in the ER expression builder (for more information, see [Extend the list of Electronic reporting (ER) functions](../../dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting-formulas-list-extension.md)) is not supported any more. Due to changes of the ER APIs, the API to call built-in functions from the ER expression builder became internal and can’t be extended any longer.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Code sealing initiative  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | None. Whenever a new built-in function is needed, a new extension request must be addressed to the ER framework team.<br><br>As a temporary work around while the requested function is under development by the ER team, the required logic can be programmed as a method of a custom application class. This method can be accessed in an ER expression as a property of the added ER data source of the **Application\Class** type that refers to that custom application class.  |
| **Product areas affected**         | Electronic reporting framework                                                      |
| **Deployment option**              | All                                                                                      |
| **Status**                         | Removed as of Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3.    |

### Inventory by item group and Inventory by inventory dimension aging reports

These two reports are no longer supported in Finance and Operations. Instead, the **Inventory aging** report can be used to improve the user experience.

|   |  |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Duplicate functionality  |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | Yes. The two reports have been replaced by the **Inventory aging** report.     |
| **Product areas affected**       | Inventory management, Cost management        |

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Product updates in Microsoft Power BI. |

Data partitions provide a logical separation of data in the Dynamics AX database.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Data partitions were introduced in Dynamics AX 2012 R2 to enable data isolation. In a common scenario, a company has subsidiaries, and the data from one subsidiary should not be visible to another subsidiary, even though both subsidiaries are managed by the same IT department. However, extra scripts and management overhead throughout the program were required in order to create new partitions and populate them with data, and to back up partition data. In the cloud, where we have access to platform as a service (PaaS) database services (Microsoft Azure SQL Database), it's much more efficient to use a database as the isolation container than to do isolation in the program. Regardless of whether data partitioning is required for subsidiaries, for multiple tenants, or just for scale, we believe that the scenarios can be handled better through multiple instances of Finance and Operations. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Customers using data partitions must use multiple instances of Finance and Operations if database level separation is a critical issue.    |
| **Product areas affected**         | All modules  |
| **Status**                         | Removed as of Dynamics AX 7.0.  |


### Database and file share storage for attachments

Dynamics AX 2012 allowed storage of attachments in the database and in file shares. Both of those options are no longer supported.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Files share storage is no longer supported because cloud-hosted environments cannot communicate with local file shares. Database storage has been deprecated in favor of Azure Blob storage. Azure Blob storage is equivalent to storage in the database, as documents can only be accessed through Finance and Operations client forms. This provides the added benefit of providing storage that doesn't negatively affect the performance of the database. Blob storage is the default storage mechanism for Document Management and works immediately. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Database storage has been deprecated in favor of Azure Blob storage.   |
| **Product areas affected**         | All modules  |
| **Status**                         | Removed as of Dynamics AX 7.0.   |

### Delimitation

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | No use of the functionality was found. |

### Desktop client

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The Dynamics AX client experience has been redesigned to improve usability across multiple platforms and devices.                      |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | The new web client is based on the desktop Form metadata and programming model that have been modified to provide a rich web platform. |
| **Product areas affected**         | All modules  |
| **Status**                         | Removed as of Dynamics AX 7.0.   |

### Direct database connection

In Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Retail Modern POS could connect directly to the Channel DB in similar fashion to Enterprise POS. This was in addition to the standard communication method of Retail Modern POS communicating through Retail Server.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Direct database connectivity required lower security protocols and was primarily used to achieve the highest levels of performance. Due to the performance and security enhancements that have occurred in Finance and Operations, this functionality now causes more issues than it solves. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No. Only standard Retail Server communication is now supported.  |
| **Product areas affected**         | Channel DB/Retail Modern POS   |
| **Status**                         | Removed as of Dynamics AX 7.0.  |

### Dutch SWIFT MT940

This feature enabled the generation of Mexican electronic invoices by using the Comprobante Fiscal Digital (CFD) method, where the company signs the invoice by requesting the related authorization from the government. This feature also provides a monthly report that includes all electronics invoices that were issued in the period.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The method is no longer applicable. The generation of electronic invoices by using the CFD method was deprecated by the tax authorities and replaced by the Comprobante Fiscal Digital a través de Internet (CFDI) method, where the signing is delegated to the third-party provider (PAC). The monthly report has been removed, and an inquiry option lets users inquire about historical transactions. |

### Product builder

Product builder was used to dynamically configure items from a sales order, purchase order, production order, sales quotation, project quotation, or item requirement. Based on a product model that had modeling variables, the user could select values to meet the customer requirements and get a unique product variant that had a BOM and route.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Product builder exposed X++ code to end users and isn't supported in the current version of Dynamics AX. It has been removed to avoid duplicate maintenance efforts on overlapping, sizeable codebases.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes. The constraint-based configuration was introduced in Dynamics AX 2012 where the depreciation of Product builder in future versions was already announced. The constraint-based configuration technology is selected on the product masters to enable the configuration. To learn more, see [Product configuration overview](../../../supply-chain/pim/build-product-configuration-model.md). |

### Production Floor app
This is the app for tablet devices running Windows 8.1 RT and Windows 8.1 Pro.

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | With the change to a web-based client, it is possible to deliver similar functionality through the native Dynamics AX 7.0 client. The Job Card Device provides a production floor user interface that is optimized for touch and tablet form factors. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes. The Job Card Device, which is a native part of Dynamics AX 7.0.                                                                           |

| **Status**                         | Removed as of Dynamics AX 7.0.    |


### Virtual company accounts

The virtual companies feature is no longer supported in Dynamics AX. The virtual companies feature let users set up tables that could be shared by a set of companies. For a description of the feature, see [Company accounts and Virtual company accounts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa834382(v=ax.10).aspx). The feature works by grouping tables into collections that are assigned to virtual companies, which are groups of existing “real” companies. Queries are created so that all the companies in the virtual company can access the data in the tables of the associated table collections.

|   |  | 
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | - Virtual companies must be set up before data is stored in the tables. Retrofitting virtual companies onto an existing implementation is very difficult.<br><br>- Because there has been so much data normalization in the current version of Dynamics AX, it has become difficult to know what to add to the table collections. For example, it's difficult to know which tables to share. All the tables referenced from tables that are in a virtual company must also added. Because of table normalization, even simple master data that is spread across multiple tables must be part of the virtual company. Any mistake that is made here will cause functional issues.<br><br>- When a table is part of a virtual company, it loses information about the origin of the data, and only the virtual company is recorded.   |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | Global tables can be used to make tables accessible from all companies. Currently, there is no replacement. |   
| **Product areas affected**       | All modules |   
| **Status**                       | Removed as of Dynamics AX 7.0.   |   

### Windows 8 tablet app

### Workplanner

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Low usage |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No, but the **Profile relation** page, which is opened from the **Profile groups** page, supports the same business scenario as the deprecated **Workplanner** page. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Time and attendance     |
| **Status**                         | The code has not been removed. However, the form, JmgWorkPlanner, was not migrated.    |
