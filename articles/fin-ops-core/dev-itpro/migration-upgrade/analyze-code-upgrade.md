# Upgrade from AX 2012 - Estimate effort by using the Code upgrade service

This article explains how to use the Code upgrade service in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to help estimate the tasks and effort that are required in order to upgrade a code base from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Finance and Operations.

The Code upgrade service converts an export of your AX 2012 model store to the correct format. However, the new version of your code won’t be fully functional until a developer resolves any issues that the service identifies but can’t resolve itself.

The Code upgrade service performs these actions:

- Directly resolve some types of conflict issues.
- For other issues, log Microsoft Azure DevOps tasks.
- Create a version of your code in the correct format, and check the new version into a new branch of your Azure DevOps project.

In the Analyze phase, we use the report to help estimate the effort that is required in order to complete code conversion activities.

The following illustration shows an overview of the process for configuring the Code upgrade service.

For information about how to configure the Code upgrade service, see [Configure the code upgrade service in Lifecycle Services (LCS)](../lifecycle-services/configure-execute-code-upgrade.md).

The output of the Code upgrade service is designed to be consumed by a developer. This output will help the developer estimate the effort that is required in order to complete the code upgrade tasks. To form an estimate, the developer must review the tasks that the service generates in Azure DevOps and the new version of the code that the service generates.
