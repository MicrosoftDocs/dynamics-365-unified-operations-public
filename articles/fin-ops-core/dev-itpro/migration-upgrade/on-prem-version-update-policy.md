# Software Lifecycle Policy for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article outlines the lifecycle and support policies for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises) releases.

## Product life time

The product life time of Finance + Operations (on-premises) software ends **December 2027**. Licensed customers who are in compliance with this policy are entitled to product support. Product support is available at a minimum through December 31, 2027.

## Modern Lifecycle Policy

Finance + Operations (on-premises) software is covered by the Modern Lifecycle Policy. The Modern Lifecycle Policy rules products and services that are serviced and supported continuously. For more information about this policy, see [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy).  

Licensed customers must regularly update their deployment of the Finance + Operations (on-premises) software. The servicing policy requires that you maintain the Software Assurance (SA) or the Enhancement Plan and it requires that you deploy the update releases provided through the [continuous service updates](on-prem-version-update-policy.md#continuous-service-updates).

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use the Fixed Support Lifecycle Policy (5+5), you must downgrade to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. If you instead lapse on your SA or the Enhancement Plan, you will only be eligible for the perpetual license rights to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and must uninstall Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance + Operations (on-premises).

## On-premises software update policies

As a customer, you are in full control of your on-premises deployments and must actively follow this policy. You are in control of installing updates in your on-premises environments.

Microsoft will support your deployment of Finance + Operations (on-premises) software only if you keep the deployed software current according to this policy.

Critical fixes and non-critical updates are handled in the following way:

- **Critical fixes** – Critical fixes include security fixes and any fixes that are required to support reliability and availability. Critical fixes will be made available in the latest platform update version.
- **Non-critical updates** – Customers must update to the most current Finance + Operations platform and financial reporter version to deploy non-critical updates.

## Finance + Operations (on-premises) release dates

### Continuous service updates

Since November 2018, on-premises service updates are released continuously. For more information about version numbers and availability dates, see [Software lifecycle policy and cloud releases](versions-update-policy.md). For more information about One Version service updates, see [One Version service updates FAQ](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/one-version.md).

Every service update release has a specific expiration date after which the release isn't entitled to receive support.

#### Continuous combined releases (Application and Platform)

With [Continuous service updates](on-prem-version-update-policy.md#continuous-service-updates), application and platform are released together. The [One Version schedule](../../fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases.md#targeted-release-schedule-dates-subject-to-change) specifies the dates for early access, public release, and expiration of the release.

Expired versions will be removed from LCS at some point where after servicing and deployment of such versions from LCS may not be possible.
