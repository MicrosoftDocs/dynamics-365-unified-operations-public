This topic explains how to use the Upgrade analyzer tool to plan your upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. This tool is run against an AX 2012 environment and identifies data that you should clean up in AX 2012 to help reduce the subscription cost for Finance and Operations. The tool also suggests SQL configuration optimizations that can help speed up the upgrade processes. Additionally, the tool warns you if any features that you use in AX 2012 are obsolete in the current version. Therefore, you can plan ways to replace or work around those features.

Upgrade analyzer gathers data from your AX 2012 environment as part of the regular System diagnostic service in Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For an overview of the System diagnostic service, and for information about how data is collected and pushed back into the cloud so that you can consume it through LCS, see [System diagnostics in Lifecycle Services (LCS)](../lifecycle-services/ax-2012/system-diagnostics-lcs.md).

You can view the results of the System diagnostic service in a Microsoft Power BI report in LCS. The report presents a list of tasks that you should complete in the AX 2012 environment.

To access the Upgrade analyzer report, go to https://diag.lcs.dynamics.com/UpgradeAnalysisReport/Report/"ProjectID" (Replace "ProjectID" with your current project ID, which is an integer that can be found in the URL of your current LCS project).

The following illustration shows an overview of the procedure for using Upgrade analyzer.

If you already use the System diagnostic service in your AX 2012 environment, you must configure a new instance of the service on a machine that differs from the existing machine.

For information about how to configure the System diagnostic service in your AX 2012 environment, see [Install and run System diagnostics](../lifecycle-services/ax-2012/install-run-system-diagnostics-lcs.md).

Within a few minutes after you configure the System diagnostic service, the AX 2012 environment will appear in your LCS project.
