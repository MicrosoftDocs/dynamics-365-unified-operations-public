# Software lifecycle policy and cloud releases

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic outlines the lifecycle and support policies for the Finance and Operations online service.

## Modern Lifecycle Policy
The Finance and Operations online service is covered by the Modern Lifecycle Policy. The Modern Lifecycle Policy covers products and services that are serviced and supported continuously. For more information about this policy, see [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881). Licensed customers must stay current with updates to the Finance and Operations online service in accordance with the following servicing and system requirements:

- Customers purchasing subscriptions of Finance and Operations and operating on the following application versions will experience continuous updates of the Platform and Financial Reporting. Microsoft will continually update these components with the option to postpone up to 3 consecutive service updates.
    - Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 (November 2016)
    - Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017)
    - Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3
    - Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, version 8.0 (April 2018)

- Platform versions maintain backward compatibility with the application versions that are supported at the time of the platform release within the application support lifecycle. For more information about platform versions, see [Cloud platform monthly updates FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/sysadmin/faq-platform-monthly-updates).

- Critical fixes and non-critical updates are handled in the following way:

    - **Critical fixes** – Critical fixes include security fixes and any fixes that are required to adhere to the availability service level agreement (SLA) that the service supports. Critical fixes will be made available in the latest platform update version and in the latest service update for customers operating on version 8.1. In addition, to help protect the customer and the online service, Microsoft might apply critical fixes directly to a customer's environment. If a critical fix must be applied, Microsoft will notify the customer about the required downtime window (if there will be any downtime) and apply the fix to the applicable environment. The critical fix will update the system to the latest update version.

    - **Non-critical updates** – Customers operating on the following application releases must update to the most current Finance and Operations platform and financial reporter version to deploy non-critical updates. 
    
       - Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 (November 2016)
       - Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017)
       - Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3
       - Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, version 8.0 (April 2018)
     
      Customers operating on release 8.1 must update to the most current service update to deploy non-critical updates.

> [!Note]
> Application and platform releases expire at the end of the month of their software lifecycle.
>
> Microsoft will not provide any fixes to issues on versions that have reached end of service. Microsoft will also not investigate or troubleshoot any issue that you may encounter on an older version. If you encounter an issue on a version that has reached end of service, you will be required to update to the latest update and report the issue if it persists.
>
> All environments will continue to be operated by Microsoft. All automatic processes around your environments, such as monitoring or self-healing, will also continue as is for supported versions.

### Table 4: Application updates

The application updates listed below consist of a small subset of application enhancements released on top of Finance and Operations versions 8.0, 7.3, and 7.2 (July 2017). These updates do not affect the support lifecycle of the release--support is in-line with the policies for each release.

Note that application updates are not cumulative. The individual packages only contain the enhancements that were included in that specific release. However, if there is a dependency between two packages, then both packages will be included.
