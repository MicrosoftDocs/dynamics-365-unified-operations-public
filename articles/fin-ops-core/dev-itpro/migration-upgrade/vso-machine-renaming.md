# Rename a local development (VHD) environment

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A local development (VHD) environment must be renamed for the following scenarios:

* **Accessing a single Microsoft Azure DevOps project across multiple machines:** Azure DevOps is required for version control. It was previously known as Visual Studio Online (VSO) or Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). In development topologies, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can't access the same Azure DevOps project if they have the same machine name. Azure DevOps uses the machine name for identification. If you're developing on local VMs that were downloaded from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you might encounter issues.
* **Installing One Version service updates:** One Version service updates, such as 8.1.x, must be installed in VHD environments by using a runbook. To help guarantee that the runbook is completed successfully, the VHD environments must be renamed. Additional steps that are described in this topic must also be completed.

## Rename the machine
Rename and restart the machine before you start development or connect to Azure DevOps. Make sure that the new name is unique among all the machines that are used with the Azure DevOps project.

## Update the server name in SQL Server
Update the server name in Microsoft SQL Server 2016 by running the following commands. 

```sql
sp_dropserver [old_name];
GO
sp_addserver [new_name], local;
GO
```

In these commands, be sure to replace **old\_name** with the old name of the server and **new\_name** with the new name. By default, the old name is **MININT-F36S5EH**, but you can run **select @@servername** to get the old name. Additionally, be sure to restart the SQL Server service after the commands have finished running.

## Update SQL Server Reporting Services
Update the SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS) database by using the Reporting Services Configuration Manager. Select **Database**, select **Change Database**, and use the new server name. Make sure that you use Reporting Services Configuration Manager for SQL Server 2016.

## Additional steps to install One Version service updates
The following additional steps are required in order to install One Version service updates in a VHD environment.

### Update the Azure Storage Emulator
Update the Azure Storage Emulator, and make sure that it's running. From the **Start** menu, open **Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator - v4.0**, and run the following commands.

This command starts the emulator.

```Console
AzureStorageEmulator.exe start
```

This command verifies that the emulator is running.

```Console
AzureStorageEmulator.exe status
```

Try the **init** option with the **-server** switch or the **-forcecreate** switch. Be sure to replace **new\_name** with the new name.

```Console
AzureStorageEmulator.exe init -server new_name
AzureStorageEmulator.exe init -forcecreate
```

If the **init** command fails, delete the storage emulator database by using SQL Server Management Studio. Then try the following command.

```Console
AzureStorageEmulator.exe init
```

When you run this command, you might receive the following error message: "Error: Cannot create database." However, the emulator will usually still start. You just need the emulator to start.

### Update financial reporting
Update the server name for financial reporting by using a script that is included in the One Version service update. To get the command, you must download and expand the One Version service update.

Open a Microsoft Windows PowerShell command window as an admin, and run the following command. This command contains the default passwords that might have to be updated. Be sure to replace **new\_name** with the new name.

```powershell
cd <update folder>\MROneBox\Scripts\Update
.\ConfigureMRDatabase.ps1 -NewAosDatabaseName AxDB -NewAosDatabaseServerName new_name -NewMRDatabaseName ManagementReporter -NewAxAdminUserPassword AOSWebSite@123 -NewMRAdminUserName MRUser -NewMRAdminUserPassword MRWebSite@123 -NewMRRuntimeUserName MRUSer -NewMRRuntimeUserPassword MRWebSite@123 -NewAxMRRuntimeUserName MRUser -NewAxMRRuntimeUserPassword MRWebSite@123
```
