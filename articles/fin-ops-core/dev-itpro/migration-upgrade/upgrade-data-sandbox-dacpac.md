# Upgrade from AX 2012 - Dacpac process to upgrade data in Sandbox Tiers 2-5 environments

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

[!include [upgrade banner](../includes/upgrade-banner.md)]

This topic is a process guide that will help customers who no longer have Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to their Tier-2 through Tier-5 sandbox environments when they upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 to Finance and Operations apps. By using a new file format this is based on data-tier application packages (DACPACs), and the [Database movement toolkit](../database/database-movement-toolkit.md), customers can bring their AX 2012 schema and data into an existing empty database in a sandbox environment.

We **strongly recommend** that you run the data upgrade process in a development environment before you run it in a shared sandbox environment. This approach will help reduce the overall time that is required for a successful data upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrade from AX 2012 - Pre-upgrade checklist for data upgrade](prepare-data-upgrade.md).

In this process guide, you will learn how to complete the following steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Open firewall access to your sandbox environment database.
> * Clear the sandbox database of all objects.
> * Publish the schema from your AX 2012 database to the sandbox database.
> * Transfer the data from the source database to the target database.
> * Apply the data upgrade package from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).
> * Copy the database to production for mock go-live validation and actual go-live.

## Open firewall access to your sandbox environment database

By default, all sandbox Standard Acceptance Test environments use Azure SQL Database as their database platform. The databases for these environments are protected by firewalls that restrict access to the Application Object Server (AOS) that they were originally deployed with.

However, your public IP address can be used to grant access to your source system. Different methods can be used to grant this access, depending on your environment type and RDP access. Regardless of the method, connection to the database requires that the server and the database be explicitly specified. You can find this information on the environment details page in LCS. 

Find the user name record for **axdbadmin**, and make a note of the server and the database in the format **{sqlServer\\sqlDatabase}**, such as **spartan-nam-opsprod365433\\DBOpsProd365_SandboxUAT_d2145fe**. In this case, the server value for Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is **spartan-nam-opsprod365433.database.windows.net**, and the database value is **DBOpsProd365_SandboxUAT_d2145fe**. To specify the database, you must select **Options** in the SSMS connection dialog box. Use the **axdbadmin** credentials (user name and password).

### Microsoft-managed environments where RDP access is available

If you have RDP access to your sandbox, sign in to the sandbox AOS virtual machine (VM), and open SSMS. In SSMS, enter the server, user name, and password. On the **Options** tab, explicitly enter the database name from the **axdbadmin** record in LCS.

After you're connected, open a query against the database, and enter your IP address in the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command.

```sql
-- Create database-level firewall setting for IP a.b.c.d 
EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule N'AX 2012 Upgrade via RDP', 'a.b.c.d', 'a.b.c.d'; 
```

Back in your source environment, open SSMS, and try to connect by using the same **axdbadmin** credentials against the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) database. You must verify that you can connect before you move on to the next steps.

Note that firewall rules are deleted whenever you do a database refresh or whenever you do a database import from LCS.

### Microsoft-managed environments without RDP access

Follow the process for [Enable just-in-time database access](../database/database-just-in-time-JIT-access.md) to allow-list your IP address to the database.

Before the allow-list entry expires, connect to the sandbox database by entering the server, user name, and password. On the **Options** tab, explicitly enter the database name from the **axdbadmin** record in LCS.

After you're connected, open a query against the database, and enter your IP address in the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command.

```sql
-- Create database-level firewall setting for IP a.b.c.d 
EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule N'AX 2012 Upgrade without RDP', 'a.b.c.d', 'a.b.c.d'; 
```

A second entry is created in the firewall rules. This entry won't expire. Note that these firewall rules are deleted whenever you do a database refresh or whenever you do a database import from LCS.

### Self-service environments

Unfortunately, sandbox environments of the self-service type aren't supported for AX 2012 upgrade scenarios, because they don't currently support data upgrade packages. Microsoft is working to add this support and will update this topic when more information is available.

## Clear the sandbox database of all objects

In this step, you will clean out the sandbox database that has a Finance and Operations schema. This process will provide a blank or empty database that you can bring your source AX 2012 schema from. Later, you will also be able to bring the data from it. If the data upgrade fails, you can always come back to this step and start over.

Open SSMS, and connect to your sandbox database as you did in the previous step. Right-click the database name, and then select **Generate scripts**. On the **Introduction** page, select **Next**. On the **Choose Objects** page, select the **Select specific database objects** option, and then select the following check boxes:

* Tables
* Views
* Stored procedures
* User-defined functions
* Schemas
* Full text catalogs
* User-defined table types

On the **Set Scripting Options** page, select **Advanced**, and then change the **Script DROP and CREATE** value to **Script DROP**. Select **OK**, and then select the **Save to new query window** option. Select **Next** to move through the summary. The query window that appears contains a script that lists all the objects in the correct order so that the objects can be dropped from the database.

When you're ready to continue, run the script in the query window that was generated directly against the AXDB database of your sandbox environment. This script takes an average of 15 to 20 minutes to run.

## Publish the schema from AX 2012 to the sandbox database

Now that the database is empty, you can publish your non-upgraded 2012 schema. For this step, you should download the latest version of the [Database movement toolkit](../database/database-movement-toolkit.md) into your source environment.

Use Windows PowerShell to change the directory to the folder location where you unzipped the Database movement toolkit (for example, C:\\dbmovement-toolkit\\). Then run the **AX2012SchemaPublish.ps1** script. Use the following parameters:

* **SourceServerName** – The location where your source AX 2012 database is hosted. This location can be **localhost**.
* **AX2012DBName** – The name of your AX 2012 database (for example, **MicrosoftDynamicsAX**).
* **TargetServerName** – The server value of your sandbox database server (for example, **spartan-srv-12345.database.windows.net**). You retrieved this value in a previous step.
* **TargetDBName** – The name of your AXDB database (for example, **d365opsprod-12345**). You retrieved this value in a previous step.
* **AxDBAdminPassword** – The password for the **axdbadmin** database account.

![Running the AX2012SchemaPublish.ps1 script](media/upgrade-dacpac-extract.png)

During execution, the script uses SqlPackage.exe to extract only the database and schema definitions from your AX 2012 database as a 2012DBSource.dacpac file in the working directory. Next, it publishes this file to your sandbox environment by using the Profile.publish.xml publishing profile that is included in the Database movement toolkit. This publishing profile will skip several object types, such as SQL Views, SQL Users, Statistics, and other objects that aren't required for the upgrade.

When the script has finished running, open SSMS, and verify that you can see the tables in the sandbox database. Also confirm that the tables are empty and have no data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you must start over because of an error, go back to the [Clear the sandbox database of all objects](#clear-the-sandbox-database-of-all-objects) step.

## Transfer data from AX 2012 to the sandbox database

Now that the schema is in place, you must transfer the data to the target tables. A SQL-linked server will be used for this transfer. The transfer will also take advantage of parallelism features that are available in the instance of Windows PowerShell version 7.0 or later that is included in the Database Movement toolkit.

Use Windows PowerShell to change the directory to the folder location where you unzipped the Database movement toolkit (for example, C:\\dbmovement-toolkit\\). Then run the **AX2012DataTransfer.ps1** script. Use the following parameters:

* **SourceServerName** – The location where your source AX 2012 database is hosted. This location can be **localhost**.
* **AX2012DBName** – The name of your AX 2012 database (for example, **MicrosoftDynamicsAX**).
* **TargetServerName** – The server value of your sandbox database server (for example, **spartan-srv-12345.database.windows.net**). You retrieved this value in a previous step.
* **TargetDBName** – The name of your AXDB database (for example, d365opsprod-12345). You retrieved this value in a previous step.
* **AxDBAdminPassword** – The password for the axdbadmin database account.
* **LinkedServerName** – The name of the SQL-linked server to create (for example, **AX2012Link**).
* **DegreeOfParallelism** – The number of tables that should be processed in parallel (for example, **3**). The value should be no more than half of the number of cores that are available in the source environment, because the script is CPU-intensive and RAM-intensive.

![Running the AX2012DataTransfer.ps1 script](media/upgrade-dacpac-xfer.png)

During execution, if a linked server between the source server and the sandbox server doesn't already exist, the script creates one. It then copies data from all the AX 2012 tables to the target database. It uses the **DegreeOfParallelism** parameter to process multiple tables at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> If you must start over because of an error, go back to the [Clear the sandbox database of all objects](#clear-the-sandbox-database-of-all-objects) step.

## Apply the data upgrade package from LCS

Now that the schema and the data have been moved to the sandbox environment, you can start the data upgrade process. As a prerequisite, make sure that your LCS project has been configured for AX 2012 upgrade. For more information, see [Identify the project as an AX 2012 upgrade](upgrade-overview-2012.md#identify-the-project-as-an-ax-2012-upgrade).

On the environment details page for your environment, select **Maintain** \> **Apply updates**, and wait for the list of packages to be loaded. If you scroll to the bottom of the list, you will see that data upgrade packages are added to it as they are pulled in from the Shared asset library. It might take some time for all the available upgrade packages to be loaded.

Select the upgrade package that matches the version that you want to upgrade to. For example, to upgrade to version 10.0.14, select **AX2012DataUpgrade-10-0-14**.

### Troubleshooting data upgrade errors

There are several ways to troubleshoot data upgrade errors. In some cases, you can view the error in the deployable package logs from LCS. For example, you can use this approach when the error is related to starting/stopping services and database synchronization.

If the upgrade fails while an upgrade script is running, you can view the errors in the ReleaseUpdateScriptsErrorLog table in the sandbox database. To access this table, connect to the sandbox database by using the information in previous steps.

If you can fix the data, you can resume the upgrade from LCS. However, note that you can't resume from LCS more than eight times. Any attempt to resume more than eight times will cause another failure, because the servicing systems don't allow more attempts. In this case, you can use the **Abort** button to cancel the upgrade package and try again later.

> [!NOTE]
> If you must start over because of an error, go back to the [Clear the sandbox database of all objects](#clear-the-sandbox-database-of-all-objects) step.

## Copy the database to production for mock go-live and actual go-live

After the data upgrade is completed, apply the same customization packages from your sandbox environment to your production environment. You can then copy your sandbox environment AXDB database to the production environment.

For information about how to perform the copy operation, see [Copy the sandbox database to production](../database/dbmovement-scenario-goldenconfig.md#copy-the-sandbox-database-to-production).
