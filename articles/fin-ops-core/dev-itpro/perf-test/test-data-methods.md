# Test data methods

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Entity and helper navigation objects expose test methods that let you set up test data. This topic provides information about the most common types of test data methods.

## Factory methods

Factory methods focus on creating data that doesn't yet exist in the database. There are two types of entity factory methods, `init` methods and `create` methods. An `init` method initializes the entity but doesn't save it to the database. A `create` method initializes the entity and saves it to the database.

### Naming convention

`init<EntitySpecification>`

`create<EntitySpecification>`

In this naming convention, `<EntitySpecification>` is the description of the key characteristics of the object that must be created.

### Examples

```xpp
salesOrder = data.sales().salesOrders().initDefault();

purchaseOrder = data.purch().purchaseOrders().createDefault();
```

### Best practices

The `create` method should always call the `init` method that has the same entity specification.

#### Example

```xpp
public AtlEntitySalesOrder createDefault()
{
    AtlEntitySalesOrder salesOrder = this.initDefault();
    salesOrder.save();
    return salesOrder;
}
```

### Prerequisite data

The `init` method should take care of setting up prerequisites.

Before some entities can be created, specific prerequisites must be set up. In these cases, the `ensure` method must be called before the entity is initialized. You must also subscribe to all the entity events that require automatic setup of prerequisites.

#### Example

```xpp
public AtlEntitySalesOrder initDefault()
{
    AtlEntitySalesOrder salesOrder;

    this.ensureCanCreate();

    salesOrder = new AtlEntitySalesOrder();
    salesOrder.parmCustomer(data.cust().customers().default());

    _salesOrder.postingInvoice += eventhandler(this.ensureCanPostInvoice);
    _salesOrder.postingPackingSlip += eventhandler(this.ensureCanPostPackingSlip);
    _salesOrder.releasingToWarehouse += eventhandler(this.ensureCanReleaseToWarehouse);
}
```

## Builder methods

Builder methods are responsible for initializing creator objects that will be used to create data that doesn't yet exist in the database.

### Naming convention

`<EntitySpecification>Builder`

In this naming convention, `<EntitySpecification>` is the description of the key characteristics of the object that must be created.

### Example

```xpp
catchWeightItem = data.invent().items().cwBuilder();
```

## Well-known data methods

Well-known data methods provide a way to reference an entity that is set up in a specific way. If the entity doesn't exist in the database, it's created.

### Naming convention

`<EntitySpecification>`

In this naming convention, `<EntitySpecification>` is the description of the key characteristics of the object that must be retrieved.

### Example

```xpp
fifo = data.invent().modelGroup().fifo();
```

In this example, the contract of the method specifies that the model group should use first in, first out (FIFO) as the inventory model. The rest of the settings can be left at their default values.

Sometimes, a real-world name communicates the contract better.

```xpp
pieces = data.common().units().pieces();
```

In this example, it's clear that **pieces** is a unit of measure of the "quantity" class, and that is has a decimal precision of 0 (zero).

### Contract of well-known data methods

Here are a few things to remember about the common contract of the well-known data methods.

- Two calls to the same well-known data method should provide the caller with the reference to the same entity.

    ```xpp
    fifo1 = data.invent().modelGroups().fifo();
    fifo2 = data.invent().modelGroups().fifo();
    fifo1.InventModelGroupId == fifo2.InventModelGroupId;
    ```

- Creation of a test entity isn't always worth the effort. If a test entity isn't created, the corresponding record buffer should be returned from the well-known data method. For example, if you don't invest the time and effort to create the Site entity, the `site` well-known data method will return InventSite records.

    ```xpp
    InventSite site = data.invent().sites().default();
    ```

- Well-known data methods can take IDs as optional parameters when this approach makes sense.

    ```xpp
    item1 = data.products().items().default('Item1');
    item2 = data.products().items().default('item2');
    ```

### Implementation

If there is already a builder or a factory method that is named `<EntitySpecification>`, it should be used as the internal implementation to create the well-known entity.

#### Example

```xpp
public InventTable whsBatchAbove(ItemId _itemId = this.whsBatchAboveItemId())
{
    InventTable whsItem = InventTable::find(_itemId, true);
    if (!whsItem)
    {
        whsItem = this.whsBatchAboveBuilder().setItemId(_itemId).create();
    }
    return whsItem;
}
```

## Ensure methods

Ensure methods are responsible for setting up prerequisites that are required in order to create an entity or run a business operation.

### Naming convention

`ensureCan<ExecuteBusinessOperation>`

In this naming convention, `<ExecuteBusinessOperation>` is a verb that describes the business operation.

### Examples

```xpp
data.sales().salesOrders().ensureCanCreate();

data.purch().purchaseOrders().ensureCanPostProductReceipt();
```

### Implementation

Figuring out prerequisites for a complex business operation, such as invoice posting, can be complicated and requires lots of knowledge about the feature area.

#### Example

```xpp
public void ensureCanCreate()
{
    data.helpers().setNumberSequenceReference(extendedTypeNum(InventDimId));
}
```

#### Automatic prerequisite setup

To enable automatic prerequisite setup, you must call the `ensure` methods in the appropriate `init` method. For more information, see the [Factory methods](#factory-methods) section earlier in this topic.

## Query methods

Query methods are responsible for initializing new queries for the entity type of the navigation node that they are defined on.

### Naming convention

`query`

### Examples

```xpp
loadLinesQuery = data.whs().loadLines().query();

purchaseLinesQuery = data.invent().transferOrderLines().query();
```

## Specification methods

Specification methods are responsible for initializing new specification objects for the entity type of the navigation node that they are defined on.

### Naming convention

`spec`

### Example

```xpp
loadLinesSpec = data.whs().loadLines().spec();
```

## Find methods

Find methods let you find an entity based on the primary key.

### Naming convention

`find`

### Example

```xpp
salesOrder = data.sales().salesOrders().find(salesOrderId);
```

### Automatic prerequisite setup

If the entity has query support, the implementation should use the query that has already set up prerequisite support. Otherwise, after you find the record buffer and initialize the new instance of the entity, you should subscribe `ensure` methods to the business operation events of the entity.
