# Prospect-to-cash in dual-write

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



An important goal of most businesses is to convert prospects to customers and then maintain an ongoing business relationship with those customers. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps, the prospect-to-cash process occurs through quotations or order processing workflows, and the financials are reconciled and recognized. Integration of prospect-to-cash with dual-write creates a workflow that takes a quotation and an order that originate in either Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, and makes the quotation and order available in both apps.

In the app interfaces, you can access the processing statuses and invoice information in real time. Therefore, you can more easily manage functions such as product stocking, inventory handling, and fulfillment in Supply Chain Management, without having to re-create the quotations and orders.

## Prerequisites and mapping setup

Before you can sync sales quotations, you must update the following settings.

### Setup in Sales

In Sales, go to **Settings \> Administration \> System settings \> Sales**, and make sure that the following settings are used:

- The **Use system prizing calculation** system option is set to **Yes**.
- The **Discount calculation method** field is set to **Line item**.

### Sites and warehouses

In Supply Chain Management, the **Site** and **warehouse** fields are required for quotation lines and order lines. If you set the site and warehouse in the default order settings, those fields will automatically be set when you add a product to a quotation line or an order line. 

### Number sequences for quotations and orders

The number sequences for Supply Chain Management and Sales aren't connected when quotations and orders are created and synced in Sales and Supply Chain Management. If a sales order that is created in Sales is synced to Supply Chain Management, it has the same sales order number in Supply Chain Management. To help ensure that the sales order number isn't duplicated, you must use different number sequence systems in the two apps.

For example, the number sequence in Supply Chain Management is **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...**, and the number sequence in Sales is **100, 99, 98, ...**. If you create 100 sales orders in Sales, an order number will eventually be generated that already exists in Supply Chain Management. In other words, the two number sequences will eventually overlap as sales orders are created in Supply Chain Management and Sales. Instead, you might use a number sequence such as **F1, F2, F3, ...** in Supply Chain Management and a number sequence such as **C1, C2, C3, ...** in Sales. These number sequences will never produce duplicate sales order numbers.

## Sales quotations

Sales quotations can be created in either Sales or Supply Chain Management. If you create a quotation in Sales, it's synced to Supply Chain Management in real time. Likewise, if you create a quotation in Supply Chain Management, it's synced to Sales in real time. Note the following points:

+ You can add a discount to the product on the quotation. In this case, the discount will be synced to Supply Chain Management. The **Discount**, **Charges**, and **Tax** fields on the header are controlled by a setup in Supply Chain Management. This setup doesn't support integration mapping. Instead, the **Price**, **Discount**, **Charge**, and **Tax** fields are maintained and handled in Supply Chain Management.
+ The **Discount %**, **Discount**, and **Freight Amount** fields on the sales quotation header are read-only fields.
+ The **Freight terms**, **Delivery terms**, **Shipping method**, and **Delivery mode** fields aren't part of the default mappings. To map these fields, you must set up a value mapping that is specific to the data in the organizations that the entity is synced between.

If you are also using the Field Service solution, make sure to re-enable the **Quote Line Quick Create** parameter. Re-enabling the parameter lets you to continue creating quote lines using the quick create function.
1. Navigate to your Dynamics 365 Sales application.
2. Select the settings icon in the top navigation bar.
3. Select **Advanced Settings**.
4. Choose the **Customize the System** option.
5. Select the **Quote Line** menu item.
6. Go to the **Data Services** section and select the **Allow quick create** checkbox.

## Sales orders

Sales orders can be created in either Sales or Supply Chain Management. If you create a sales order in Sales, it's synced to Supply Chain Management in real time. Likewise, if you create a sales order in Supply Chain Management, it's synced to Sales in real time. Note the following points:

+ Write-in products on Dynamics 365 Sales will appear as product categories in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.
+ Discount calculation and rounding:

    - The discount calculation model in Sales differs from the discount calculation model in Supply Chain Management. In Supply Chain Management, the final discount amount on a sales line can be the result of a combination of discount amounts and discount percentages. If this final discount amount is divided by the quantity on the line, rounding can occur. However, this rounding isn't considered if a rounded per-unit discount amount is synced to Sales. To help ensure that the full discount amount from a sales line in Supply Chain Management is correctly synced to Sales, the full amount must be synced without being divided by the line quantity. Therefore, you must define the discount calculation method as **Line item** in Sales.
    - When a sales order line is synced from Sales to Supply Chain Management, the full line discount amount is used. Because Supply Chain Management has no field that can store the full discount amount for a line, the amount is divided by the quantity and stored in the **Line discount** field. Any rounding that occurs during this division is stored in the **Sales charges** field on the sales line.

### Example: Synchronization from Sales to Supply Chain Management

You have the following sales order:

+ **Sales:** Quantity = 3, per-line discount = $10.00
+ **Supply Chain Management:** Quantity = 3, line discount amount = $3.33, sales charge = –$0.01

If you sync from Supply Chain Management to Sales, you get the following result:

+ **Supply Chain Management:** Quantity = 3, line discount amount = $3.33, sales charge = –$0.01
+ **Sales:** Quantity = 3, per-line discount = (3 × $3.33) + $0.01 = $10.00

## Dual-write solution for Sales

New fields have been added to the **Order** entity and appear on the page. Most of these fields appear on the **Integration** tab in Sales. There are a few special fields:

+ The **Processing status** field shows the processing status of the order in Supply Chain Management. This field is locked and shows only the status of the order from Supply Chain Management. The following values are available:

    + **Active** – The status after the order is activated in Sales by using the **Activate** button.
    + **Confirmed**
    + **Delivered**
    + **Invoiced**
    + **Partially Delivered**
    + **Partially Invoiced**
    + **Picked**
    + **Canceled**

    The following table shows how the processing status is mapped to the **CRM status code** value.

    | Processing status           | CRM status code    |
    |-----------------------------|--------------------|
    | Active                      | New/Pending/Onhold |
    | Confirmed/Picked            | In Progress        |
    | Partially Delivered         | Partial            |
    | Delivered                   | Complete           |
    | Invoiced/Partially Invoiced | Invoiced           |
    | Canceled                    | No Money           |

+ The **Create Invoice** and **Cancel Order** buttons on the **Sales order** page are hidden in Sales.
+ The **Sales order status** value will remain **Active** to help ensure that changes from Supply Chain Management can flow to the sales order in Sales. To control this behavior, set the default **Statecode \[Status\]** value to **Active**.

## Invoices

Sales invoices are created in Supply Chain Management and synced to Sales. Note the following points:

+ An **Invoice number** field has been added to the **Invoice** entity and appears on the page.
+ The **Create invoice** button on the **Sales order** page is hidden, because invoices will be created in Supply Chain Management and synced to Sales. The **Invoice** page can't be edited, because invoices will be synced from Supply Chain Management.
+ The **Sales order status** value is automatically changed to **Invoiced** when the related invoice from Supply Chain Management has been synced to Sales. Additionally, the owner of the sales order that the invoice was created from is assigned as the owner of the invoice. Therefore, the owner of the sales order can view the invoice.
+ The **Freight terms**, **Delivery terms**, and **Delivery mode** fields aren't included in the default mappings. To map these fields, you must set up a value mapping that is specific to the data in the organizations that the entity is synced between.
