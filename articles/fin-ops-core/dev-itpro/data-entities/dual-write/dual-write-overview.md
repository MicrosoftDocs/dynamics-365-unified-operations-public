## What is dual-write?

Dual-write is an out-of-the-box infrastructure that provides seamless near-real-time interaction between Microsoft Dynamics 365 model-driven applications and Finance and Operations applications. When data on customers, products, people, and operations flow seamlessly beyond application boundaries, it create a digital feedback loop and empowers all departments in an organization.

Dual-write provides a tightly coupled, bi-directional integration between Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and the Common Data Service. Any create, read, update change in Finance and Operations results in writes, in near-real-time, to the Common Data Service and vice versa. This tight data integration provides an integrated user experience across the apps.
