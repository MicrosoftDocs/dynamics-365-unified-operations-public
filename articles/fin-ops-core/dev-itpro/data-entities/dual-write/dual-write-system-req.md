# System requirements for dual-write

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



The setup of a dual-write connection has the following requirements:

+ Finance and Operations apps that have build version 10.0.9 and platform update 33 or later
+ Model-driven apps in Microsoft Dynamics 365 that have platform version 9.1.0000.11732 or later

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't run dual-write and the [Prospect to cash solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/sales-marketing/accounts-template-mapping-direct) for Data integrator side by side. If you're running the Prospect to cash solution for Data integrator, you must uninstall it.

## One Version

Future updates of the dual-write solution will be available through One Version.
