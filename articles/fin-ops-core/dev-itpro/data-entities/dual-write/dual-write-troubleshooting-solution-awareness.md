This topic provides troubleshooting information for dual-write integration between Finance and Operations apps and Common Data Service. Specifically, it provides information that can help you fix issues that are related to solution awareness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the issues that this topic addresses might require either the system admin role or Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant admin credentials. The section for each issue explains whether a specific role or credentials are required.

## Error on the Dual-write page

On the **Dual-write** page, you might receive an error message that resembles the following example:

*The entity with a name 'msdyn\_dualwriteentitymap' with namemapping='Logical' was not found in the MetadataCache.*

To fix the issue, make sure that the dual-write core solution is installed in Common Data Service. The dual-write core solution is a prerequisite for solution awareness.
