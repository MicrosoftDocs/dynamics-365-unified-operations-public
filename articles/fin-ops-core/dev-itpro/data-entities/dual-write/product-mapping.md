# Unified product experience

[!include [preview-banner](../../includes/preview-banner.md)]

When a business ecosystem is made up of Dynamics 365 applications, such as Finance, Supply Chain Management, and Sales, businesses often use these applications to source product data. This is because these apps provides a robust product infrastructure complemented with sophisticated pricing concepts and accurate on-hand inventory data. Businesses who use an external Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system for sourcing the product data can channelize products from Finance and Operations apps to other Dynamics 365 apps. The unified product experience brings the integrated product data model in to Common Data Service, so that all application users, including Power Platform users, can take advantage of the rich product data coming from Finance and Operations apps.

Here is the product data model from Sales.

Here is the product data model from Finance and Operations apps.

![Data model for products in Finance and Operations](media/dual-write-products-5.jpg)

These two product data models have been integrated in Common Data Service as shown below.

![Data model for products in Dynamics 365 apps](media/dual-write-products-6.jpg)

The dual-write entity maps for products have been designed to flow data one-way only, in near-real time from Finance and Operations apps to Common Data Service. However, the product infrastructure has been made open to make it bi-directional if required. Although you can customize it, it's at your own risk, as Microsoft does not recommend this approach.

## Templates

Product information contains all the information related to the product and its definition, such as the product dimensions or the tracking and storage dimensions. As the following table shows, a collection of entity maps is created to sync products and related information.

Finance and Operations | Other Dynamics 365 apps | Description
-----------------------|--------------------------------|---
Released products V2 | msdyn\_sharedproductdetails | The **msdyn\_sharedproductdetails** entity contains the fields from Finance and Operations apps that define the product, and that contain the product's financial and management information. 
Common Data Service released distinct products | Product | The **Product** entity contains the fields that define the product. It includes individual products (products with subtype product) and the product variants. The following table shows the mappings.
Product number identified barcode | msdyn\_productbarcodes | Product bar codes are used to uniquely identify products.
Default order settings | msdyn\_productdefaultordersettings
Product specific default order settings | msdyn_productdefaultordersettings
Product dimension groups | msdyn\_productdimensiongroups | The product dimension group defined which product dimensions define the product. 
Storage dimension groups | msdyn\_productstoragedimensiongroups | The product storage dimension group represents the method used to define the placement the product in the warehouse.
Tracking dimension groups | msdyn\_producttrackingdimensiongroups | The product tracking dimension group represents the method used to track the product in inventory.
Colors | msdyn\_productcolors
Sizes | msdyn\_productsizes
Styles | msdyn\_productsytles

Product master colors | msdyn_sharedproductcolors | The **Shared product color** entity indicates the colors that a specific product master can have. This concept is migrated to Common Data Service to keep data consistent.
Product master sizes | msdyn_sharedproductsizes | The **Shared product size** entity indicates the sizes that a specific product master can have. This concept is migrated to Common Data Service to keep data consistent.
Product master styles | msdyn_sharedproductstyles | The **Shared product style** entity indicates the styles that a specific product master can have. This concept is migrated to Common Data Service to keep data consistent.
Product master configurations | msdyn_sharedproductconfigurations | The **Shared product configuration** entity indicates the configurations that a specific product master can have. This concept is migrated to Common Data Service to keep data consistent.
All products | msdyn_globalproducts | The all products entity contains all the products available in Finance and Operations apps, both the released products and the non-released products.
Unit | uoms
Unit conversions | msdyn_ unitofmeasureconversions
Product specific unit of measure conversion | msdyn_productspecificunitofmeasureconversion
Product categories | msdyn_productcategories | Each of the product categories and information about its structure and characteristics are contained in the product category entity. 
Product category hierarchies | msdyn_productcategoryhierarhies | You use product hierarchies to categorize or group products.The category hierarchies are available in Common Data Service using the Product category hierarchy entity. 
Product category hierarchy roles | msdyn_productcategoryhierarchies | Product hierarchies can be used for different roles in D365 Finance and Operations. The specify which category is used in each role the product category role entity is used. 
Product category assignments | msdyn_productcategoryassignments | To assign a product to a category the product category assignments entity can be used.

## Integration of products

In this model, the product is represented by the combination of two entities in Common Data Service: **Product** and **msdyn\_sharedproductdetails**. Whereas the first entity contains the definition of a product (the unique identifier for the product, the product name, and the description), the second entity contains the fields stored at the product level. The combination of these two entities is used to define the product according to the concept of the stock keeping unit (SKU). Each released product will have its information in the mentioned entities (Product and Shared Product Details). To keep track of all products (released and not released), the **Global products** entity is used. 

Because the product is represented as a SKU, the concepts of distinct products, product masters, and product variants can be captured in Common Data Service in the following way:

- **Products with subtype product** are products that are defined by themselves. No dimensions have to be defined. An example is a specific book. For these products, one record is created in the **Product** entity, and one record is created in the **msdyn\_sharedproductdetails** entity. No product family record is created.
- **Product masters** are used as generic products that hold the definition and rules that determine the behavior in business processes. Based on these definitions, distinct products that are known as product variants can be generated. For example, T-shirt is the product master, and it can have Color and Size as dimensions. Variants can be released that have different combinations of these dimensions, such a small blue T-shirt or a medium green T-shirt. In the integration, one record per variant is created in the product table. This record contains the variant-specific information, such as the different dimensions. The generic information for the product is stored in the **msdyn\_sharedproductdetails** entity. (This generic information is held in the product master.) Additionally, one product family record is created per product master. The product master information is synced to Common Data Service as soon as the released product master is created (but before variants are released).
- **Distinct products** refer to all the products subtype product and all the product variants. 

![Data model for products](media/dual-write-product.png)

With the dual-write functionality enabled, the apps from Finance and Operations will be synchronized in other Dynamics 365 apps in **Draft** state. They are added to the first pricelist with the same currency. In other words, they are added to the first pricelist in a Dynamics 365 app that matches the currency of your legal entity where the product is released in a Finance and Operations app. 

By default products from Finance and Operations apps are synchronized to other Dynamics 365 apps in **Draft** state. To synchronize the product with **Active** state so that you can directly use it in sales order quotations, for example, the following setting needs to be chosen: **System> Adminstration > System administration > System settings > Sales** tab and select **Create products in active state = yes**. 

Note that the synchronization of products happens from Finance and Operations apps to Common Data Service. This means that the values of the product entity fields can be changed in Common Data Service, but when the synchronization is triggered (when a product field is modified in a Finance and Operations app), this will overwrite the values in Common Data Service.

[!include [global products](includes/EcoResEveryProductEntity-msdyn-globalproducts.md)]

## Product dimensions 

Product dimensions are characteristics that identify a product variant. The four product dimensions (Color, Size, Style, and Configuration) are also mapped to Common Data Service to define the product variants. The following illustration shows the data model for the product dimension Color. The same model is applied to Sizes, Styles and Configurations. 

![Data model for products](media/dual-write-product-two.png)

[!include [product colors](includes/EcoResProductColorEntity-msdyn-productcolor.md)]

[!include [product sizes](includes/EcoResProductSizeEntity-msdyn-productsizes.md)]

[!include [product sizes](includes/EcoResProductStyleEntity-msdyn-productstyles.md)]

[!include [product sizes](includes/EcoResProductConfigurationsEntity-msdyn-productconfigurations.md)]

When a product has different product dimensions (for example, a product master has Size and Color as product dimensions), each distinct product (that is, each product variant) is defined as a combination of those product dimensions. For example, product number B0001 is an extra-small black T-shirt, and product number B0002 is a small black T-shirt. In this case, the existing combinations of product dimensions are defined. For example, the T-shirt from the preceding example can be extra-small and black, small and black, medium and black, or large and black, but it can't be extra-large and black. In other words, the product dimensions that a product master can take are specified, and variants can be released based on these values.

To keep track of the product dimensions that a product master can take, the following entities are created and mapped in Common Data Service for each product dimension.

## Default order settings and product specific default order settings

Default order settings define the site and warehouse where items will be sourced from or stored, the minimum, maximum, multiple and standard quantities that will be used for trading or inventory management, the lead times, the stop flag, and the order promising method. This information is available in Common Data Service using the default order settings and product specific default order settings entity. You can read more information about the functionality in the [Default order settings topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/production-control/default-order-settings).

## Unit of measure and unit of measure conversions

The units of measure and its respective conversions is available in the Common Data Service following the data model shown in the diagram.

![Data model for products](media/dual-write-product-three.png)

The unit of measure concept is integrated between Finance and Operations apps and other Dynamics 365 apps. For each unit class in a Finance and Operations app, a unit group is created in a Dynamics 365 app, which contains the units belonging to the unit class. A default base unit is also created for every unit group.

## Initial synchronization of units data matching between Finance and Operations and Common Data Service

### Initial synchronization of units

When dual write is enabled, units from Finance and Operations apps are synchronized to other Dynamics 365 apps. The unit groups synchronized from Finance and Operations apps in Common Data Service have a flag set that indicates they are “Externally maintained”.

### Matching units and unit classes/groups data from Finance and Operations and other Dynamics 365 apps

First, it's important to note that the integration key for unit is msdyn_symbol. Therefore, this value must be unique in Common Data Service or other Dynamics 365 apps. Because in other Dynamics 365 apps it is the pair “Unit group ID” and “Name” that define the uniqueness of a unit, you need to consider different scenarios for matching unit data between Finance and Operations apps and Common Data Service.

For units matching/overlapping in Finance and Operations apps and other Dynamics 365 apps:

+ **The unit belongs to a unit group in other Dynamics 365 apps that corresponds to the associated unit class in Finance and Operations apps**. In this case, the field msdyn_symbol in other Dynamics 365 apps must be filled in with the unit symbol from Finance and Operations apps. Therefore, when the data will be matched, and the unit group will be set as “Externally maintained” in other Dynamics 365 apps.
+ **The unit belongs to a unit group in other Dynamics 365 apps that does not correspond to the associated unit class in Finance and Operations apps (no existing unit class in Finance and Operations apps for the unit class in other Dynamics 365 apps).** In this case, the msdyn_symbol must be filled in with a random string. Note that this value must be unique in other Dynamics 365 apps.

For units and unit classes in Finance and Operations not existing in other Dynamics 365 apps:

As part of dual-write the unit groups from Finance and Operations apps and its corresponding units are created and synchronized in other Dynamics 365 apps and Common Data Service and the unit group will be set as “Externally maintained”. No extra bootstrapping effort is required.

For units in other Dynamics 365 apps that do not exist in Finance and Operations apps:

The field msdyn_symbol must be filled in for all units. The units can always be created in Finance and Operations apps in the corresponding unit class (if it exists). If the unit class doesn't exist, first the unit class must be created (note that you cannot create a unit class in Finance and Operations apps except through extension if you are extending the enum) matching the other Dynamics 365 apps unit group. Then you can create the unit. Note that the unit symbol in Finance and Operations apps must be the msdyn_symbol previously specified in other Dynamics 365 apps for the unit.

## Product policies: dimension, tracking and storage groups

The product policies are sets of policies used for defining products and its characteristics in inventory. The product dimension group, product tracking dimension group and storage dimension group can be found as product policies.

## Integration key for products 

To uniquely identify products between Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and products in Common Data Service the integration keys are used. 
For products, the **(productnumber)** is the unique key that identifies a product in Common Data Service. It's composed by the concatenation of: **(company, msdyn_productnumber)**. The **company** indicates the legal entity in Finance and Operations and **msdyn_productnumber** indicates the product number for the specific product in Finance and Operations. 

For a other Dynamics 365 apps user, the product is identified in the UI with the **msdyn_productnumber** (note that the label of the field is **Product number**). In the product form both the company and the msydn_productnumber are shown. However, the (productnumber) field, the unique key for a product, is not shown. 

If you build apps on Common Data Service, you should pay attention to using the **productnumber** (the unique product ID) as the integration key. Do not use **msdyn_productnumber**, because it's not unique. 

## Initial synchronization of products and migration of data from Common Data Service to Finance and Operations

### Initial synchronization of products 

When dual-write is enabled, products from Finance and Operations apps are synchronized to Common Data Service and other model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. Products created in Common Data Service and other Dynamics 365 apps before dual-write was released will not be updated or matched with product data from Finance and Operations apps.

### Matching product data from Finance and Operations and other Dynamics 365 apps

If the same products are kept (overlapping/matching) in Finance and Operations and in Common Data Service and other Dynamics 365 apps, when enabling dual-write the synchronization of products from Finance and Operations will take place, and duplicate records will appear in Common Data Service for the same product.
To avoid the previous situation, if other Dynamics 365 apps have products that are overlapping/matching with Finance and Operations, then the administrator enabling dual write must bootstrap the fields **Company** (example: "USMF") and **msdyn_productnumber** (example: "1234:Black:S") before the synchronization of products takes place. In other words, these two fields in the product in Common Data Service must be filled in with the respective company in Finance and Operations to which the product needs to be matched with and with its product number. 

Then, when the synchronization is enabled and takes place, the products from Finance and Operations will be synchronized with the matched products in Common Data Service and other Dynamics 365 apps. This is applicable for both distinct products and product variants. 


### Migration of product data from other Dynamics 365 apps to Finance and Operations

If other Dynamics 365 apps has products that aren't present in Finance and Operations, the administrator can first use the **EcoResReleasedProductCreationV2Entity** for importing those products in Finance and Operations. And secondly, match the product data from Finance and Operations and other Dynamics 365 apps as described above.
