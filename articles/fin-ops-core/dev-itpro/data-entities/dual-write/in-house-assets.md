# In-house assets for servicing

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service is designed to service customer assets. Asset management for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is designed to maintain in-house assets. Integration of these two apps lets you use Field Service to service both customer assets and in-house assets. You can also classify the assets, based on functional location or hierarchy, and track the servicing at a detailed level.

For more information, see [Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service and Supply Chain Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/supply-chain-field-service-integration).
