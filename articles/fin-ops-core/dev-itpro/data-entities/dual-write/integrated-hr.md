# Integrated worker, job, and position

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



Worker data can be mastered in more than one Microsoft Dynamics 365 app. For example, Human resources (HR) data can be managed in Dynamics 365 Human Resources, Dynamics 365 Commerce, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. Regardless of where the data originates, it's integrated behind the scenes. The ability to integrate data about workers gives you the flexibility to master worker data in any Dynamics 365 app. It also provides a comprehensive view of the information in Dynamics 365 apps.

## Human resources

The integration of HR data involves just mapping the HR data between Finance and Operations apps and model-driven apps in Dynamics 365.

## Templates

HR data includes information about employees and contractors, positions, and jobs. A collection of entity maps works together during data interaction, as shown in the following table.

| Finance and Operations apps | Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 | Description |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Compensation job function | cdm\_jobfunctions | |
| Compensation job type | cdm\_jobtypes | |
| Employment | cdm\_employments | |
| Employment detail | cdm\_employments | |
| Jobs | cdm\_jobs | |
| Job detail | cdm\_jobs | |
| Position details | cdm\_jobpositions | |
| Position durations | cdm\_jobpositions | |
| Position hierarchies | cdm\_jobpositions | |
| Position type | cdm\_positiontypes | |
| Position worker assignments | cdm\_positionworkerassignmentmaps | |
| Worker | cdm\_workers | In Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management data, workers are classified as either employees or contractors. Common Data Service can also classify workers as volunteers. Volunteers will become contractors when the data is transformed back into Finance and Supply Chain Management. |
