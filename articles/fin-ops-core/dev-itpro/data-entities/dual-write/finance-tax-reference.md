# Access to finance and tax reference data

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



Every business works with a basic set of financial data, such as the fiscal calendar year, the currency that business is transacted in, the accounts that the money to run the business comes in to or goes out of, tax rates, and remittance. This data resides in Finance and Operations apps. However, it's exposed to Dataverse so that customer engagement apps can have a single source for finance and tax data. In this way, data is uniform across the business ecosystem.

Finance and tax data is integrated by using the following mappings:

+ [Integrated ledger](ledger-mapping.md)
+ [Integrated tax master](tax-mapping.md)
