# Troubleshoot issues with the Dual-write module in Finance and Operations apps

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



This topic provides troubleshooting information for dual-write integration between Finance and Operations apps and Common Data Service. Specifically, it provides information that can help you fix issues with the **Dual-write** module in Finance and Operations apps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the issues that this topic addresses might require either the system admin role or Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant admin credentials. The section for each issue explains whether a specific role or credentials are required.

## You can't load the Dual-write module in a Finance and Operations app

If you can't open the **Dual-write** page by selecting the **Dual Write** tile in the **Data management** workspace, the data integration service is probably down. Create a support ticket to request a restart of the data integration service.

## Error when you try to create a new entity mapping

**Required credentials to fix the issue:** Azure AD tenant admin

You might receive the following error message when you try to configure a new entity for dual-write:

*Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (Unauthorized)*

This error occurs because only an Azure AD tenant admin can add a new entity mapping.

To fix the issue, sign in to the Finance and Operations app as an Azure AD admin tenant. You must also go to web.PowerApps.com and revalidate your connection.

## Error when you open the dual-write user interface

You might receive the following error message when you try to access dual-write from the **Data management** workspace:

*login.microsoftonline.com refused to connect.*

To fix the issue, sign in by using an InPrivate window in Microsoft Edge, an incognito window in Chromium, or an incognito window in Google Chrome. You must also unblock or clear third-party cookies.

## Error when you link the environment for dual-write or add a new entity mapping

**Required credentials to fix the issue:** Azure AD tenant admin

You might encounter the following error when linking or creating maps:

*Response status code does not indicate success: 403 (tokenexchange).<br>
Session ID: \<your session id\><br>
Root activity ID: \<your root activity id\>*

This error can occur if you don't have sufficient permissions to link dual-write or create maps. You must use an Azure AD tenant admin account to link environments and add new entity mappings. However, after setup, you can use a non-admin account to monitor status and edit the mappings.

## Error when you stop the entity mapping

You might receive the following error message when you try to stop the entity mappings:

*\[Forbidden\], \[{"status":403,"source":"","message":"Error from token exchange:
User is not allowed to access connection
dynamicscrmonline/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx"}\], The remote server returned an
error: (403) Forbidden.*

This error occurs when the linked Common Data Service environment isn't available.

To fix the issue, create a ticket for the Data Integration team. Attach the network trace so that the Data Integration team can mark the maps as **Not running** in the back end.
