# Troubleshoot issues during initial synchronization

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides troubleshooting information for dual-write integration between Finance and Operations apps and Common Data Service. Specifically, it provides information that can help you fix issues that might occur during initial synchronization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the issues that this topic addresses might require either the system admin role or Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant admin credentials. The section for each issue explains whether a specific role or credentials are required.

## Check for initial synchronization errors in a Finance and Operations app

After you enable the mapping templates, the status of the maps should be **Running**. If the status is **Not running**, errors occurred during initial synchronization. To view the errors, select the **Initial sync details** tab on the **Dual-write** page.

## You can't complete initial synchronization: 400 Bad Request

**Required role to fix the issue:** System admin

You might receive the following error message when you try to run the mapping and initial synchronization:

*(\[Bad Request\], The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.), AX export encountered an error*

Here is an example of the full error message.

```console
Dual write Initial Sync completed with status: Error. Following are the details:
Executed leg: From AX Financial dimensions to CRM msdyn_dimensionattributes
with exported records count: 0, ImportRecordsErrorCount: 0,
ImportRecordsInsertedCount: 0 and ImportRecordsUpdatedCount: 0
ErrorsDetails:
Dual write Initial sync failed
Message: ([Bad Request], The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.), AX export encountered an error
Stacktrace: at
Microsoft.Dynamics.Integrator.QueryGenerator.AxClient.\<ExportAxPackage\>d__16.MoveNext()
in X:\\bt\\1024532\\repo\\src\\Core\\QueryGenerator\\AxClient.cs:line 265
\--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---

at Microsoft.D365.ServicePlatform.Context.ServiceContext.Activity.\<ExecuteAsync\>d__11\`2.MoveNext()
\--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---
```

If this error occurs consistently, and you can't complete the initial synchronization, follow these steps to fix the issue.

1. Sign in to the virtual machine (VM) for the Finance and Operations app.
2. Open Microsoft Management Console.
3. In the **Services** pane, make sure that the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Data import export framework service is running. Restart it if it has been stopped, because the initial synchronization requires it.

## Initial synchronization error: 403 Forbidden

You might receive the following error message during initial synchronization:

*(\[Forbidden\], The remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden.), AX export encountered an error*

To fix the issue, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the Finance and Operations app.
2. On the **Azure Active Directory applications** page, delete the **DtAppID** client, and then add it again.

## Self-reference or circular reference failures during initial synchronization

You might receive an error messages if any of your mappings have self-references or circular references. The errors fall into these categories:

- [Errors in the Vendors V2–to–msdyn_vendors entity mapping](#error-vendor-map)
- [Errors in the Customers V3–to–Accounts entity mapping](#error-customer-map)

## <a id="error-vendor-map"></a>Resolve errors in the Vendors V2–to–msdyn_vendors entity mapping

You might encounter initial synchronization errors for the mapping of **Vendors V2** to **msdyn\_vendors** if the entities have existing records where there are values in the **PrimaryContactPersonId** and **InvoiceVendorAccountNumber** fields. These errors occur because **InvoiceVendorAccountNumber** is a self-referencing field, and **PrimaryContactPersonId** is a circular reference in the vendor mapping.

The error messages that you receive will have the following form.

*Couldn't resolve the guid for the field: \<field\>. The lookup was not found: \<value\>. Try this URL(s) to check if the reference data exists: `https://focdsdevtest2.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/<entity>?$select=<field>&$filter=<field> eq <value>`*

Here are some examples:

- *Couldn't resolve the guid for the field: msdyn\_vendorprimarycontactperson.msdyn\_contactpersonid. The lookup was not found: 000056. Try this URL(s) to check if the reference data exists: `https://focdsdevtest2.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/contacts?$select=msdyn_contactpersonid.contactid&$filter=msdyn_contactpersonid eq '000056'`*
- *Couldn't resolve the guid for the field: msdyn\_invoicevendoraccountnumber.msdyn\_vendoraccountnumber. The lookup was not found: V24-1. Try this URL(s) to check if the reference data exists: `https://focdsdevtest2.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/msdn_vendors?$select=msdyn_vendoraccountnumber,msdyn_vendorid&$filter=msdyn_vendoraccountnumber eq 'V24-1'`*

If any records in the vendor entity have values in the **PrimaryContactPersonId** and **InvoiceVendorAccountNumber** fields, follow these steps to complete the initial synchronization.

1. In the Finance and Operations app, delete the **PrimaryContactPersonId** and **InvoiceVendorAccountNumber** fields from the mapping, and then save the mapping.

    1. On the dual-write mapping page for **Vendors V2 (msdyn\_vendors)**, on the **Entity mappings** tab, in the left filter, select **Finance and Operations apps.Vendors V2**. In the right filter, select **Sales.Vendor**.
    2. Search for **primarycontactperson** to find the **PrimaryContactPersonId** source field.
    3. Select **Actions**, and then select **Delete**.

        ![Deleting the PrimaryContactPersonId field](media/vend_selfref3.png)

    4. Repeat these steps to delete the **InvoiceVendorAccountNumber** field.

        ![Deleting the InvoiceVendorAccountNumber field](media/vend-selfref4.png)

    5. Save your changes to the mapping.

2. Turn off change tracking for the **Vendors V2** entity.

    1. In the **Data management** workspace, select the **Data entities** tile.
    2. Select the **Vendors V2** entity.
    3. On the Action Pane, select **Options**, and then select **Change tracking**.

        ![Selecting the Change tracking option](media/selfref_options.png)

    4. Select **Disable Change Tracking**.

        ![Selecting Disable Change Tracking](media/selfref_tracking.png)

3. Run initial synchronization for the **Vendors V2 (msdyn\_vendors)** mapping. The initial synchronization should run successfully, without any errors.
4. Run initial synchronization for the **CDS Contacts V2 (contacts)** mapping. You must sync this mapping if you want to sync the primary contact field on the vendors entity, because initial synchronization must also be done for the contact records.
5. Add the **PrimaryContactPersonId** and **InvoiceVendorAccountNumber** fields back to the **Vendors V2 (msdyn\_vendors)** mapping, and then save the mapping.
6. Run initial synchronization again for the **Vendors V2 (msdyn\_vendors)** mapping. Because change tracking is turned off, all the records will be synced.
7. Turn change tracking back on for the **Vendors V2** entity.

## <a id="error-customer-map"></a>Resolve errors in the Customers V3–to–Accounts entity mapping

You might encounter initial synchronization errors for the mapping of **Customers V3** to **Accounts** if the entities have existing records where there are values in the **ContactPersonID** and **InvoiceAccount** fields. These errors occur because **InvoiceAccount** is a self-referencing field, and **ContactPersonID** is a circular reference in the vendor mapping.

The error messages that you receive will have the following form.

*Couldn't resolve the guid for the field: \<field\>. The lookup was not found: \<value\>. Try this URL(s) to check if the reference data exists: `https://focdsdevtest2.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/<entity>?$select=<field>&$filter=<field> eq <value>`*

Here are some examples:

- *Couldn't resolve the guid for the field: primarycontactid.msdyn\_contactpersonid. The lookup was not found: 000056. Try this URL(s) to check if the reference data exists: `https://focdsdevtest2.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/contacts?$select=msdyn_contactpersonid.contactid&$filter=msdyn_contactpersonid eq '000056'`*
- *Couldn't resolve the guid for the field: msdyn\_billingaccount.accountnumber. The lookup was not found: 1206-1. Try this URL(s) to check if the reference data exists: `https://focdsdevtest2.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/accounts?$select=accountnumber.account&$filter=accountnumber eq '1206-1'`*

If any records in the customer entity have values in the **ContactPersonID** and **InvoiceAccount** fields, follow these steps to complete the initial synchronization. You can use this approach for any out-of-box entities, such **Accounts** and **Contacts**.

1. In the Finance and Operations app, delete the **ContactPersonID** and **InvoiceAccount** fields from the **Customers V3 (accounts)** mapping, and then save the mapping.

    1. On the dual-write mapping page for **Customers V3 (accounts)**, on the **Entity mappings** tab, in the left filter, select **Finance and Operations app.Customers V3**. In the right filter, select **Common Data Service.Account**.
    2. Search for **contactperson** to find the **ContactPersonID** source field.
    3. Select **Actions**, and then select **Delete**.

        ![Deleting the ContactPersonID field](media/cust_selfref3.png)

    4. Repeat these steps to delete the **InvoiceAccount** field.

        ![Deleting the InvoiceAccount field](media/cust_selfref4.png)

    5. Save your changes to the mapping.

2. Turn off change tracking for the **Customers V3** entity.

    1. In the **Data management** workspace, select the **Data entities** tile.
    2. Select the **Customers V3** entity.
    3. On the Action Pane, select **Options**, and then select **Change tracking**.

        ![Selecting the Change tracking option](media/selfref_options.png)

    4. Select **Disable Change Tracking**.

        ![Selecting Disable Change Tracking](media/selfref_tracking.png)

3. Run initial synchronization for the **Customers V3 (Accounts)** mapping. The initial synchronization should run successfully, without any errors.
4. Run initial synchronization for the **CDS Contacts V2 (contacts)** mapping.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There are two maps that have the same name. Be sure to select the map that has the following description on the **Details** tab: **Dual-write template for sync between FO.CDS Vendor Contacts V2 to CDS.Contacts. Requires new package \[Dynamics365SupplyChainExtended\].**

5. Add the **InvoiceAccount** and **ContactPersonId** fields back to the **Customers V3 (Accounts)** mapping, and then save the mapping. Both the **InvoiceAccount** field and the **ContactPersonId** field are now part of live synchronization mode again. In the next step, you will do the initial synchronization for these fields.
6. Run initial synchronization again for the **Customers V3 (Accounts)** mapping. Because change tracking is turned off, the data for **InvoiceAccount** and **ContactPersonId** will be synced from the Finance and Operations app to Common Data Service.
7. To sync the data for **InvoiceAccount** and **ContactPersonId** from Common Data Service to the Finance and Operations app, you must use a data integration project.

    1. In Power Apps, create a data integration project between the **Sales.Account** and **Finance and Operations apps.Customers V3** entities. The data direction must be from Common Data Service to the Finance and Operations app. Because **InvoiceAccount** is a new attribute in dual-write, you might want to skip initial synchronization for it. For more information, see [Integrate data into Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/data-integrator).

        The following illustration shows a project that updates **CustomerAccount** and **ContactPersonId**.

        ![Data integration project to update CustomerAccount and ContactPersonId](media/cust_selfref6.png)

    2. Add the company criteria in the filter on the Common Data Service side, so that only records that match the filter criteria will be updated in the Finance and Operations app. To add a filter, select the filter button. Then, in the **Edit query** dialog box, you can add a filter query such as **\_msdyn\_company\_value eq '\<guid\>'**. 

        > [NOTE]
        > If the filter button isn't present, create a support ticket to ask the data integration team to enable the filter capability on your tenant.

        If you don't enter a filter query for **\_msdyn\_company\_value**, all the records will be synced.

        ![Adding a filter query](media/cust_selfref7.png)

    The initial synchronization of the records is now completed.

8. In the Finance and Operations app, turn change tracking back on for the **Customers V3** entity.
