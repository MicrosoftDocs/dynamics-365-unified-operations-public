# Bootstrap with company data FAQ

## Why do I need bootstrapping? 
You might have an existing Common Data Service or other Dynamics 365 app instance with business data, and you want to enable dual-write connection against it. In this case, you need to bootstrap Common Data Service or other Dynamics 365 app data with company information before enabling dual-write connection.  
 
## When should I use bootstrapping? 
You should use bootstrapping before enabling dual-write entity maps (during step #5).  
1. To setup the dual-write connection between instances of your Finance and Operations app and the Common Data Service or other Dynamics 365 app, log in to the Finance and Operations app as an administrator. 
2. Go to the **Data Management** module and click the **Dual-Write** button. This launches the **Data Integrator**. 
3. Create the dual-write connection for one or more companies.

    > ![Create dual-write connection](media/dual-write-boot-1.png)
4. Enable the **Cdm_companies** entity map. This synchronizes companies from the Finance and Operations app to Common Data Service.

    > ![Enable the entity map](media/dual-write-boot-2.png)
5. Run the sample bootstrapping code on the Common Data Service or other Dynamics 365 app instance.  
6. When the bootstrapping is done and the system is ready for the live sync, enable the entity maps.  

    Enabling the entity maps triggers the initial data sync for the enabled entity maps. The data corresponding to the companies chosen on the dual-write connection is synchronized between the Finance and Operations app and Common Data Service. 
 
## How to I use the code sample?
The sample code is a C# application that you can load in Visual Studio. It takes NuGet package dependencies on the Common Data Service SDK, that you can refresh through standard Visual Studio tooling. 

After unzipping and opening the solution in Visual Studio and restoring the NuGet packages, search for **TODO** in the code. Each decision you need to make about how you want to bootstrap company information is noted by a **TODO**, with sample code for a canonical implementation. 

The sample code shows only one of many ways you might categorize entity records by company. By changing the logic in the **TODO** sections, you can create your custom categorization. 
 
## What should I expect?
By default, the sample application lets you provide a dictionary of business unit-to-company code mappings. Any entity you bootstrap with an **OwningBusinessUnit** field is automatically set to use the specified company. Any entity without an **OwningBusinessUnit** field, such as product, will set the company based on the mapping with an empty business unit value.

The console application expects one parameter, either **–simulate** or **–apply**. If you use the **–simulate** command line parameter, then no data is updated. Only **simulation_<entityname>.csv** files are generated in the same directory as the tool, one for each entity that would have been updated. You can iteratively review these files while working to ensure the code updates company values as expected. 

When you finish with the simulated updates, then use the **–apply** parameter. This updates all records that currently have an incorrect company value, in batches of 1000 records at a time (by default). The code is idempotent as provided, meaning you can re-run it and only the incorrectly assigned companies will be updated. When running with **–apply**, the code outputs CSV files of the changes made, which are named **applied_<entityname>.csv**.
