# Enable dual-write for existing Finance and Operations apps

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



This set of topics provides step-by step instructions that explain how to enable dual-write for existing instances of Finance and Operations apps (Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management), and also for a new or existing Common Data Service environment.

## Step-by-step instructions to enable dual-write for existing instances of Finance and Operations apps and a new or existing Common Data Service environment

The process of enabling dual-write has three parts:

1. [Make sure that you meet all the system requirements and complete all the prerequisites](requirements-and-prerequisites.md).
2. [Link your Finance and Operations app environment to Common Data Service by using the dual-write wizard](link-your-environment.md).
3. [Enable the entity maps](enable-entity-map.md).

Each part is described in a separate topic.
