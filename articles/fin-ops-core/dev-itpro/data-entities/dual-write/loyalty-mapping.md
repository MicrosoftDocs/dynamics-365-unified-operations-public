# Customer loyalty cards and reward points

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



Businesses classify customers and provide sophisticated services, based on customer shopping and spending patterns. For example, Dynamics 365 Commerce has the infrastructure and functions to facilitate and handle customer loyalty cards, reward points, loyalty-based pricing, and rewards-based shopping experiences. When data about customer loyalty cards and reward points in Commerce is synced to Dataverse, customer engagement apps can use that data. For example, Dynamics 365 Customer Service users can use the data to provide the same sophisticated services through the help desk.
