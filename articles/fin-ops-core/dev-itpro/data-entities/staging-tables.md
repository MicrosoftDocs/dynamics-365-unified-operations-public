# Clean up staging tables

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.38, the **Truncate staging table** feature cleans up individual Data Management staging tables. The truncate action permanently removes all records from the staging table for the selected entity and should be used with caution. Currently, the execution of data import/export jobs that involve the selected staging table (imports or exports through staging) is affected if that staging table is truncated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you use this feature, confirm that none of the currently running jobs involve the selected staging table.

This feature is available to users who have the Data Management Administrator role. It can be accessed via the data entities in the **Data management** workspace. Select a staging table, and then select **Truncate staging table**.
