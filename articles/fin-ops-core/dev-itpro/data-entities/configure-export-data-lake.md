# Configure export to Azure Data Lake

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Export to Azure Data Lake** feature is in limited preview and may not be available in all regions and environments supported by Finance and Operations apps. If you are unable to find the **Export to Azure Data Lake** functionality in Lifecycle Services (LCS) or your Finance and Operations apps, this feature is not currently available in your environment. 
>
> Currently, previews are closed. In the coming months we will enable additional environments in several regions. We are accepting requests from customers who would like to join the preview. If you would like to join a future preview, [complete the survey](https://aka.ms/FnODataLakePreviewSurvey). We will contact you when we are ready to include you. You can also join a Yammer group by [completing the survey](https://aka.ms/FnODataLakePreviewSurvey). You can use the Yammer group to stay in contact and ask questions that will help you understand the feature.  
>
> Until the feature is enabled in your environment, you have the option to prototype/plan the feature implementation using [GitHub tools](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets/blob/master/Analytics/AzureDataFactoryARMTemplates/SQLToADLSFullExport/ReadmeV2.md). The tools will enable you to export data from your sandbox environment into a storage account in the same format as exported by the feature. 
>
> At this time, **Export to Azure Data Lake** feature is not available in Tier-1 (developer) environments. You need a cloud-based Tier-2 or higher environment to enable this feature.
>
> To make aggregate measurements available in a data lake, continue to use the feature in the manner that is described in [Make entity store available as a Data Lake](entity-store-data-lake.md).

## <a name="createServicePrinciple"></a> Create Service Principle for Microsoft Dynamics ERP Microservices

The **Export to Azure Data Lake** feature is built using a microservice that exports Finance and Operations app data to Azure Data Lake and keeps the data fresh. Microservice uses the Azure service principle, **Microsoft Dynamics ERP Microservices**, to securely connect to your Azure resources. Before you configure the Export to Data Lake feature, add the  **Microsoft Dynamics ERP Microservices** service principle to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This step enables Azure AD to authenticate the microservice. 

> [!NOTE]
> You will need **Azure Active Directory tenant administrator** rights to perform these steps.

To add the service principle, complete the following steps.
1. Launch the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory.
2. On the left menu, select **Manage** > **Enterprise Applications**, and search for the following applications.

| **Application**                          | **App ID**                           |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Dynamics ERP Microservices     | 0cdb527f-a8d1-4bf8-9436-b352c68682b2 |

If you are unable to find the above applications, complete following steps.

3. On your local machine, open the **Start** menu, and search for **PowerShell**.
4. Right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then select **Run as administrator**.
5. Run the following command to install **AzureAD** module:
     >   *Install-Module -Name AzureAD*
  - If NuGet provider is required to continue, select **Y** to install it.
  - If an **Untrusted repository** message appears, select **Y** to continue.

6. Run the following commands to add the application to the Azure Active Directory.

    > Connect-AzureAD
    
    > New-AzureADServicePrincipal –AppId '0cdb527f-a8d1-4bf8-9436-b352c68682b2'

7. Sign in as the Azure Active Directory administrator when prompted.

## <a name="ConfigureAzureResources"></a>Configure Azure Resources 

To configure the export to Data Lake, create a storage account in your own Azure subscription. This storage account is used to store data. Next, create an Azure AD application ID that grants access to the root of your storage account. Your Finance or Operations app will use the Azure AD application to gain access to storage, create the folder structure, and write data. Create a key vault in your subscription and store the name of the storage account, application ID, and the application secrets. If you don't have permission to create resources in Azure portal, you will need assistance from someone in your organization with the required permissions.

The steps, which take place in the Azure portal, are as follows:
> [!NOTE]
> When you are working in the Azure portal, you will be instructed to save several values for subsequent steps. You will also provide some of these values to your Finance and Operations apps by using Lifecycle Services (LCS). You will need Administrator access to LCS in order to do this.
1. [Create an application in Azure Active Directory](#createapplication)
2. [Grant access control roles to applications](#grantaccess)
3. [Create a Data Lake Storage (Gen2 account) in your subscription](#createsubscription)
4. [Create a key vault](#createkeyvault)
5. [Add secrets to the key vault](#addsecrets)
6. [Authorize the application to read secrets in the key vault](#authorize)
7. [Install the Export to Data Lake add-in in LCS](#installaddin)

## <a name="createapplication"></a>Create an application in Azure Active Directory

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **App registrations**.
2. Select **New registration**, and enter the following information: 

    -  **Name:** Enter a name for the app.
    -   **Supported Account types**: Choose the appropriate option.

3. After the application is created, select it and then copy and save the <a name="appid"></a>Application (client) ID at the top of the page. You will need this later.
4. On the left navigation pane, select **API permissions**.
5. Select **Add a permission**, and in the **Request API permissions** dialog box, select **Azure Key vault**.
6. Select **Delegated permissions**, select **user_impersonation**, and then select **Add permissions**.
7. On the left navigation pane, select **Certificates & secrets**, and then select **New client secret**. 
8. In the **Description** field, enter a name.
9. In the **Expires** field, select an option, and then select **Add**. The system will generate a secret and display it under the grid. 
10. Copy the secret **Value** to the clipboard. This is the  <a name="secret"></a>value you will need to provide when you set up the key vault later.

## <a name="createsubscription"></a>Create a Data Lake Storage (Gen2) account in your subscription

The Data Lake Storage account will be used to store data from your Finance and Operations apps. To manually create a storage account, you must have administrative rights to your organization's Azure subscription. To create a storage account, complete the following steps.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Create new resource**, and then search for and select **Storage account – blob, file, table, queue**.
2. In the **Create storage account** dialog box, provide values for the following parameter fields:

    - **Location:** Select the data center where your environment is located. If the data center that you select is in a different Azure region, you may incur additional data movement costs. If your Microsoft Power BI or your data warehouse is in a different region, you can use replication to move storage between regions.
    - **Performance**: We recommend you select **Standard**.
    - **Account kind**: You must select **StorageV2**. In the **Advanced options** dialog box, you will see the option, **Data Lake storage Gen2**.

3. On the **Advanced tab**, select **Data Lake storage Gen2** \> **Hierarchical namespaces**, and then select **Enabled**. If you disable this option, you may not be able to consume data that is written by Finance and Operations apps with services such as Power BI data flows and AI builder.
4. Select **Review and create**. When the deployment is complete, the new resource will be shown in the Azure portal.
5. In the Azure portal, select the storage account you created. Copy and save the <a name="storageaccount"></a>storage account name.  

## <a name="grantaccess"></a>Grant access control roles to applications 

You need to grant your application permissions to read and write to the storage account. These permissions are granted by using Roles in Azure AD.

1. In **Azure portal**, open the storage account that you created earlier.
2. Select **Access Control (IAM)** in the left navigation. 
3. On the **Access control** page, select the **Role assignments** tab.
4. Select **Add** at the top of the page, and then select **Add role assignment**.
5. In the **Add role assignment** dialog, select the **Role** field, and then select **Owner**.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't make any changes to the fields, **Assign access to** and **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**.

6. In the **Select** field, select the application that you registered earlier.
7. Select **Save**.
8. Add the remaining roles shown in the following table by repeating steps 4-7.

|   Application to be selected     |     Role to be assigned     |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [The application](#appid) you created earlier | Storage blob data contributor |
| [The application](#appid) you created earlier | Storage blob data reader     |

## <a name="createkeyvault"></a>Create a key vault

A key vault is a secure way to share details such as storage account name to your Finance and Operations apps. Complete the following steps to create a key vault and a secret.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Create a new resource** and then search for and select, **Key Vault**.
2. In the **Create key vault** dialog box, in the **Location** field, select the datacenter where your environment is located.
3. After the key vault is created, select it from the list, and on the left navigation pane, select **Overview**. 
4. Save the value in the <a name="dnsname"></a>**DNS name** field. You will need this value later.

## <a name="addsecrets"></a>Add secrets to the key vault

You are going to create three secrets in the Key vault and then add the values saved from previous steps. For each of the secrets, you will need to provide a secret name and provide the value you saved from earlier steps.

| <a name="suggest"></a>**Suggested secret name** | **Secret value that you saved earlier**  | **Example** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| app-id                    | The ID of the application [created earlier](#appid).             |8936e905-197b-xxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx|
| app-secret                | The [client secret](#secret) specified earlier.                  |NaeIxxxxxxx---xxxx7eixxx~1g-|
| storage-account-name      | The name of the [storage account](#storageaccount) created earlier. |contosod365datalake|

You will need to complete the following steps three times, once for each secret.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the key vault you created earlier and on the left navigation pane, select **Secrets**.
2. Select **Generate/Import**, and in the **Create a secret** dialog box, in the **Upload options** field, select **Manual**.
3. Enter a name for the secret. See the table in the introduction of this section for suggested names.
4. Copy and paste the corresponding secret value in the **Value** field.
6. Select **Enabled**, and then select **Create**. 

You will notice the secret created in the list of secrets.

## <a name="authorize"></a>Authorize the application to read secrets in the key vault

1. In **Azure portal**, open the key vault that you created earlier.  
2. In the **Add access policy** dialog box, select **Add**.
3. On the left navigation pane, select **Access policies > Add Access Policy** to create a new policy. 
4. In the **Add access policy** dialog box, in the **Select principal** field, locate and select the application, **Microsoft Dynamics ERP Microservices**, and then click **Select**. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you can't find **Microsoft Dynamics ERP Microservices**, see the [Create Service Principle](#createServicePrinciple) section in this document.

5. In the **Secret permissions** fields, select **Get** and **List**.  
6. In the **Access policy** dialog, select **Add**.

You should see application with access to your key vault as shown below.

| Application                                                    | Secret permissions |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Microsoft Dynamics ERP Microservices                           | Get, List          |

7.  Select **Save**.
