# X++ data selection and manipulation overview

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

You can use SQL statements, either interactively or in source code, to retrieve and modify data that is stored in the database. You can use the **select** statement and API methods for these tasks:

- [Select data](xpp-select.md): Select the data to view or modify.

    - **[select](xpp-select-statement.md) statement** – Fetch records.

- [Insert data](xpp-insert.md): Add one or more new records to a table.

    - **[insert](xpp-insert.md#insert-method) and [doInsert](xpp-insert.md#do-insert-method) methods** – Insert one record at a time.
    - **[insert\_recordset](xpp-insert.md#insert-recordset-statement), [RecordInsertList.insertDatabase](../system-classes/recordinsertlist-class.md#method-insertdatabase), and [RecordSortedList.insertDatabase](../system-classes/recordsortedlist-class.md#method-insertdatabase) methods** – Insert multiple records at the same time.

- [Update data](xpp-update.md): Modify the data in existing table records.

    - **[update](xpp-update.md#update-method) and [doUpdate](xpp-update.md#do-update-method) methods** – Update one record at a time.
    - **[update\_recordset](xpp-update.md#update-recordset-statement) statement** – Update multiple records at the same time.

- [Delete data](xpp-delete.md): Remove existing records from a table.

    - **[delete](xpp-delete.md#delete-method) and [doDelete](xpp-delete.md#do-delete-method) methods** – Delete one record at a time.
    - **[delete\_from](xpp-delete.md#delete-from-statement) statement** – Delete multiple records at the same time.

Here are some other statements that you will use in data access:

- [while select](xpp-while-select.md) statement
- [select](xpp-select-expression.md) expression
- [next](xpp-select.md) statement

[Transactional integrity](xpp-transaction.md) helps prevent data corruption and improve scalability.

The [Conversion of operations from set-based to record-by-record](xpp-data-perf.md) topic provides information about how you can use the record set–based statements and methods more efficiently.

You can also use the [SysDa classes](../sysda.md) to retrieve and modify data. The extensible SysDa API provides almost all the data access possibilities that are available in X++.
