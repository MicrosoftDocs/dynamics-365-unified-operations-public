# Conversion of operations from set-based to record-by-record

You can use the following statements and methods to help improve performance by reducing communication between the application and the database:

- [delete_from](xpp-delete.md#delete-from-statement)
- [update_recordset](xpp-update.md#update-recordset-statement)
- [insert_recordset](xpp-insert.md#insert-recordset-statement)
- [RecordSortedList.insertDatabase](../system-classes/recordsortedlist-class.md#method-insertdatabase)
- [RecordInsertList.insertDatabase](../system-classes/recordinsertlist-class.md#method-insertdatabase)

In some situations, these record setâ€“based operations can be converted to slower record-by-record operations. The following table identifies these situations.

| Situation | delete\_from | update\_recordset | insert\_recordset | RecordSortedList, RecordInsertList | Used to override |
|---|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| Non-SQL tables | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Not applicable |
| Delete actions | Yes | No | No | No | **skipDeleteActions** |
| The database log is enabled. | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | **skipDatabaseLog** |
| Overridden method | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | **skipDataMethods** |
| Alerts are set up for the table. | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | **skipEvents** |
| The **ValidTimeStateFieldType** property on a table is set to a value other than **None**. | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Not applicable |

You can use the **skip\*** settings that are shown in the "Used to override" column to explicitly skip or ignore one or more factors that adversely affect performance. If, for some reason, one of the previously mentioned SQL operations is downgraded to a record-by-record operation, all the **skip\*** settings are ignored. For example, in the following code, the **insert** method on the myTable table is run, even though it's explicitly stated that this method should be skipped if a container or memo field is defined for myTable.

```xpp
public void tutorialRecordInsertList()
{
    MyTable myTable;
    RecordInsertList insertList = new RecordInsertList(
        myTable.TableId,
        True);
    int i;
    for ( i = 1; i <=  100; i++ )
    {
        myTable.value = i;
        insertList.add(myTable);
    }
    insertList.insertDatabase();
}
```
