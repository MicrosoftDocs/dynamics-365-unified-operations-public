# X++ static classes

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes static class members in X++. In general, static methods are intended for these cases:

-   The method has no reason to access the member variables that are declared in the class.
-   The method has no reason to call any instance (non-static) methods of the class.

You declare static class members by using the **static** keyword. The **static** keyword instructs the system to create only one instance of the method, regardless of the number of instances of the class there are. This one instance is used throughout your session. 

### Static methods

This section describes a scenario where a software key type is used to help prevent piracy. Each instance of a software key can have its own unique value. Because all software keys must conform to the rules of software key design, the logic that tests for software key conformance is the same for all software keys. Therefore, the method that contains the conformance validation logic should be static. 

Here is an example of a method that is declared by using the **static** keyword.

```xpp
public class SoftwareKey
{
    static public boolean validateSoftwareKey(str _softwareKeyString)
    {
        // Your code here.
        return false;
    }
}
```

In the following example, you don't have to construct an instance of the **SoftwareKey** class before you call a static method on the class. When you want to call the static **validateSoftwareKey** method, the syntax starts with the name of the class that contains the method. A pair of colons (::) is used to connect the class name to the static method name.

```xpp
boolean yourBool = SoftwareKey::validateSoftwareKey(yourSoftwareKeyString);
```

### Static fields

Static fields are variables that are declared by using the **static** keyword. Conceptually, they apply to the class, not to instances of the class.

## Static constructors

A static constructor is guaranteed to run before any static or instance calls are made to the class. The execution of the static constructor is relative to the userâ€™s session. The static constructor has the following syntax.

```xpp
static void TypeNew()
```

You never explicitly call the static constructor. The compiler will generate code to make sure that the constructor is called exactly one time before any other method on the class. A static constructor is used to initialize any static data or perform a particular action that must be performed only one time. No parameters can be provided for the static constructor, and it must be marked as **static**. 

The following code example shows how to create a singleton instance by using a static constructor.

```xpp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton instance;

    private void new()
    {
    }

    static void TypeNew()
    {
        instance = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton Instance()
    {
        return Singleton::instance;
    }
}
```

The singleton guarantees that only one instance of the class will ever be called. The following example shows how to instantiate the singleton.

```xpp
Singleton i = Singleton::Instance();
```

## Static methods

Static methods, which are also known as *class methods*, belong to a class and are created by using the keyword **static**. You don't have to instantiate an object before you use static methods. Static methods are often used to work with data that is stored in tables. Member variables can't be used in a static method. You use the following syntax to call static methods.

```xpp
ClassName::methodName();
```

## Static and instance methods

The accessor keywords on methods never restrict calls between two methods that are in the same class, regardless of which method is static or non-static. In a static method, calls to the **new** constructor method are valid even if the **new** constructor method is decorated with the **private** modifier. The syntax for these calls requires that the **new** keyword be used. The code in a static method must construct an instance object of its own class before it can call any instance methods on the class.
