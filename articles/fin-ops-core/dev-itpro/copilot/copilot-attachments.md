# File attachments in Copilot for finance and operations apps

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The chat experience for Copilot for finance and operations apps lets you attach files, like a screenshot of the current browser window for your finance and operations apps client session. The file is part of your chat session, and you work with it by adding extended topics or tools to Copilot to create custom experiences for your environment.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the chat experience for Copilot for finance and operations apps doesn't use the files or screenshots attached to the chat session. To use the attached files, extend Copilot for finance and operations apps with topics or tools needed for user experiences that use the attached files.

- Finance and operations apps must be version 10.0.45 or later.

To add a file attachment to the chat session, follow these steps.

1. Select the **Attach** button in the chat window.

## Extending Copilot for finance and operations apps to use attachment files

By default, the chat experience for Copilot for finance and operations apps doesn't use files or screenshots attached to the chat session. Copilot adds the files to a system variable. To give Copilot the skills you want for users in your environment, you need to create custom topics or tools in Copilot for finance and operations apps.

When you attach a file to the chat session, Copilot Studio adds it to the **System.Activity.Attachments** object that has a table of file attachments. Use the file here, working with it like other files in Copilot Studio. To give Copilot more capabilities, create a topic or tool that uses file attachments and access the attached files in the table.

## Example extending Copilot with attachments

This example shows how to extend Copilot for finance and operations apps with a custom topic that uses attachment files from the chat session to give the user more capabilities. In this scenario, you add a topic that reviews an attached screenshot of an error from Copilot for finance and operations apps, and Copilot gives guidance to the user to fix the error.

### Create a prompt that analyzes the error screenshot

1. Save and close the prompt.
1. In the Copilot Studio topic, in the **Input** field of the prompt action, select the **Topic.attachment_data** variable created in the previous step.
