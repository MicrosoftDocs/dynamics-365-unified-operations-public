[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../../../supply-chain/includes/preview-banner.md)]

Copilot provides in-app help and guidance that uses the power of generative AI to give contextual support to users. Copilot accesses the full range of public documentation to offer precise assistance and streamline the navigation though the extensive capabilities of finance and operations apps.

This article describes how to enable generative help and guidance with Copilot.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../../../supply-chain/includes/preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

To enable generative help and guidance with Copilot in finance and operations apps, you must have the following prerequisites in place:

- You must be running finance and operations apps version 10.0.38, build number 7.0.7120.98, or later. (Be sure to check your build number if you're running version 10.0.38 because build 7.0.7120.98 is a quality update that was released slightly after the initial preview of version 10.0.38.)
- You must have enabled Copilot capabilities in finance and operations apps, as described in [Enable Copilot capabilities in finance and operations apps](enable-copilot.md).

## Enable the feature in the Feature management workspace

In the [**Feature management**](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace, turn on the feature that's named *(Preview) User experience for Copilot in Finance and Operations*.
