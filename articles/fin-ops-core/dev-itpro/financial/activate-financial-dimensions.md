# Financial dimension activation

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article contains information about the activating financial dimension process.

When a new financial dimension is added, users are prompted with a message stating that the financial dimension isn't consumable until **Dimension activation** is run. When **Dimension activation** is run, a database schema change occurs in the **DimensionAttributeValueCombination** and **DimensionAttributeValueSet** tables. The schema change adds a new column to the table for each financial dimension. During this process, a schema lock is placed on the two tables by Microsoft SQL Server so that the table can be updated. When the process is complete, the tables are no longer locked. If this process is attempted when a journal is open, then a deadlock may occur. If a deadlock occurs, the user could potentially receive a metadata error from the server. Users can refresh the session to get the updated metadata. The message the user receives states:

- You won't be able to consume the financial dimension anywhere until the process is run. This includes adding it to account structures.
- A schema change occurs, therefore a special privilege, the Dimension activation privilege is required to run activation.
- You should perform this during scheduled maintenance or downtime.

Adding a financial dimension is typically a deliberate business process. If there's a multi-user environment, such as a user acceptance testing or training environment, only one person should attempt this process. A second option is available when you choose the **Rebuild financial dimensions** option.

The **Rebuild financial dimensions** option is set to **No** by default, as it's a process that should only be run if unexpected results occur during the initial activation process. Rebuilding will drop and readd all financial dimensions and values to the tables.
