# Overview of Copilot capabilities in finance and operations apps

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Copilot gives users access to AI capabilities that augment the application experiences and functionality of finance and operations apps.

## Types of Copilot experiences

Copilot brings a growing set of skills that help users complete various tasks. It can appear in many different user experiences. Here are some examples:

- **Sidecar** – Copilot sits alongside the application as a *sidecar* and provides conversational support to the user. The sidecar is the primary Copilot interface in finance and operations apps. It provides a natural language chat experience that helps users work with application functionality and data. For example, the [generative help and guidance with Copilot](copilot-generative-help.md) feature is provided as a sidecar.
- **Embedded** – These Copilot features add intelligent capabilities to the application itself. In this way, they bring AI to the center of the application experience. For example, in the [Confirmed purchase orders with changes workspace](../../../supply-chain/procurement/purchase-order-changes-after-confirmation.md), AI capabilities that are built into the page help users understand and react to changes in confirmed purchase orders.
- **Outside** – External agents help orchestrate across different apps and tasks. For example, users can use Copilot to ask questions about finance and operations data. For more information, see [Chat with finance and operations data](../../dev-itpro/copilot/chat-with-fno-data.md).
