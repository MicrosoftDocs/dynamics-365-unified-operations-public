## Enable edit for externally maintained fields

Due to integration scenarios with external systems, such as the Prospect to cash integration, certain fields on Global address book and customer records were marked as externally maintained with the expectation that these values would be maintained in an external system. The **Enable edit for externally maintained fields** option has been added to the Global address book parameters (**Organization administration > Global address book > Global address book parameters**) with the default value of **No**.  If the user scenario requires these fields to be available for edit even though maintained externally, the value can be set to **Yes**.
