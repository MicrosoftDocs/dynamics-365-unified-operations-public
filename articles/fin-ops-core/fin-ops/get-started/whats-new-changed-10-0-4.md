# What's new or changed in Finance and Operations version 10.0.4 (July 2019)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations version 10.0.4. This version was released in July and has a build number of 10.0.136. For more information about version 10.0.4, see [Additional resources](whats-new-changed-10-0-4.md#additional-resources).



## Set up interest distribution for cash accounts (Public Sector)
Your agency can allocate (distribute) the interest on a bank account to specific General ledger accounts, based on the average daily balance in cash accounts. You can use this process to generate an advanced ledger entry for the interest amounts. Alternatively, you can generate the interest amounts for review, without posting them.

For more information, see [Set up interest distribution for cash accounts](../../../finance/public-sector/interest-distribution.md).

## Budget analysis report (Public Sector)
Similar to the Budget analysis inquiry, you can now use the new **Budget analysis** report to generate a summarized report that compares budgeted amounts to actual expense and revenue activity during a period that you specify. For each account, the report lists budgeted amounts, actual expenses or revenue, encumbrance amounts from purchase orders, and pre-encumbrance amounts from purchase requisitions. Additionally, the report lists the remaining budget amount for each account and fund.

For more information, see [Budget analysis report](../../../finance/public-sector/budget-analysis-report.md).

### Removed and deprecated features
The [Removed or deprecated features for finance and operations](../../dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) article describes features that have been removed or deprecated for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features for finance and operations](../../dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
