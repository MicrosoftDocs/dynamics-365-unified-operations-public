# Connect a custom help site

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Finance and Operations apps are rarely used out-of-the-box. Rather, the solution is customized and extended to fit the organization's needs. Similarly, you can customize and extend the Help experience, including adding custom Help to the in-product Help pane.  

Microsoft has provided a toolkit with sample code to help you deploy and connect custom Help to the Help pane. In [Deploying custom Help](../../dev-itpro/help/deploy.md), you can read about how you can set up a custom Help solution by publishing content as HTML to a website, make the content searchable, and extending the Help pane to connect to the website.  

If you want to collaborate with Microsoft on tools and processes for customizing help, please fill in the form at [https://aka.ms/customhelpfeedback](https://aka.ms/customhelpfeedback).
