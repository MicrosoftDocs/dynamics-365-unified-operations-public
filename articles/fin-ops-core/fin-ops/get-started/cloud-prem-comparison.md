- [Dynamics 365 Commerce](cloud-prem-comparison.md#dynamics-365-commerce)
- [Dynamics 365 Human Resources](cloud-prem-comparison.md#dynamics-365-human-resources)

Information about the [development and administration features](cloud-prem-comparison.md#development-and-administration-features) is included, as well.
