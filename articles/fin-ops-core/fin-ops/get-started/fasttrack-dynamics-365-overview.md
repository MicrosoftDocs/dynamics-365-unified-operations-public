# Microsoft FastTrack 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft FastTrack is a customer success service that is designed to help you move smoothly and confidently to Microsoft Dynamics 365, so that you can realize business value faster. When you participate in the FastTrack program, you receive guidance about implementation best practices, planning for successful rollouts, and expanding capabilities. However, you implement at your own pace. You also have access to Microsoft engineering resources who are committed to making your experience a success.

## Microsoft FastTrack overview

We offer different [deployment options](../../dev-itpro/deployment/choose-deployment-type.md) for cloud and on-premises environments. Microsoft provides a dedicated FastTrack solution architect for cloud deployments only. 

## Eligibility for FastTrack 

To get started with FastTrack, your project must meet the minimum license requirement. For more information, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409). Currently, there is a 20-seat minimum for the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Plan or equivalent.

After your **Implementation project** workspace is provisioned in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), the Microsoft FastTrack team will monitor your onboarding progress. If project onboarding is not completed within a few weeks after creating an LCS Implementation project, a reminder will be sent to the project team. It's important that the project onboarding in LCS is completed with the most accurate date, and that the email addresses listed in the setup are monitored. For more information, see [LCS project onboarding](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/project-onboarding.md).

## TechTalks

TechTalks focus on empowering both customers and partners by providing technical depth and best practices that are specific to the subject areas that are covered. These talks often provide an overview of available tooling and features. TechTalks are delivered in the form of live webcasts that include a question and answer (Q&A) session at the end. They can also be accessed on-demand and are publicly available. To view all TechTalks and sign up for future talks, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 FastTrack Tech Talks](https://learning.eventbuilder.com/Dynamics365FastTrackTechTalks).

TechTalks provide a basic understanding that will increase the value and efficiency of the workshops that are offered. The FastTrack team will guide you to relevant TechTalks that will help you prepare for specific workshops. For a complete inventory of all recorded TechTalks that are available to stream or download, see [FastTrack Tech Talks](https://community.dynamics.com/365/b/techtalks?c=Finance%20and%20Operations).

## Community
The FastTrack community provides a platform where customers and partners can post questions and get answers from FastTrack solution architects about best practices and guidance. To participate in the community, see [FastTrack Forum](https://community.dynamics.com/365/fasttrack/f/770).

## Workshops

Workshops are interactive outcome-based remote sessions. Customers and partners can provide input before the workshops and customize them for their engagements.

### Kick-off meetings

The kick-off meetings are available to customers who are eligible for a designated FastTrack solution architect. The kick-off meetings are designed to introduce the FastTrack service and the roles and responsibilities of the FastTrack team in your project, to define how three parties (the solution integrators, the customer, and Microsoft FastTrack) will collaborate during the implementation project, and provide introductory guidance about a set of critical success factors for an implementation. Some of the topics that the kick-off meetings are likely to cover include:

- Team introductions
- Project background, goals, and success factors
- Overview of FastTrack including service offering, roles and responsibilities, and differentiation between Microsoft teams
- Explanation of how services are delivered, and where and when to seek help from the FastTrack engineering team
- Critical success factors and key learning that can be shared by the FastTrack team

Typically, the designated FastTrack solution architect will initialize the engagement by scheduling a partner kick-off meeting followed by a customer kick-off meeting after the eligible customer has completed the onboarding process. For more information, see [LCS project onboarding](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/project-onboarding.md).

The typical format of a partner kick-off meeting is a one-hour Microsoft Teams call. For customers, the kick-off meeting is a three-hour Microsoft Teams call. The recommended attendees include key stakeholders like customerâ€™s project sponsor (not required for entire kick-off meeting), project managers, solution architects, technical/functional leads, business process owners from the customer, a partner, and the Microsoft teams. The kick-off meeting can also be conducted in a combined customer and partner session if the implementation partners have been through the process before.

### Solution blueprint workshops

The Solution blueprint workshops are designed to promote understanding of the solution design to facilitate alignment with the approach that Microsoft uses for public cloud deployment, known patterns and best practices, a review of the product roadmap, and project goals and schedule.
