This article describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of finance and operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and may be removed in a future update.

This list is intended to help you consider these removals and deprecations for your own planning. 

Detailed information about objects in finance and operations apps can be found in the [Technical reference reports](/dynamics/s-e/global/axtechrefrep_61). You can compare the different versions of these reports to learn about objects that have changed or been removed in each version of finance and operations apps.

## Feature deprecation effective May 2024

### Support for unregistered Microsoft account and external Microsoft Entra ID users

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To enhance the security and performance of finance and operations apps, we're announcing the deprecation of support for unregistered Microsoft account users and external Microsoft Entra users in finance and operations apps. |
| **What is changing?**   | If a [Microsoft account](/entra/external-id/microsoft-account) or [Microsoft Entra ID account](/entra/external-id/default-account) isn't registered in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant, you won't be able to access finance and operations apps. You'll receive the following error message: "AADSTS50020: user account '`contoso@contoso.com`;' from identity provider '`https://sts.windows.net/{tenant Id}/`' doesn't exist in tenant '\{tenant name\}' and can't access the application '\{application Id\}'(Finance and operations environment name) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with different Microsoft Entra ID user account. The user will be blocked at the Microsoft Entra ID tenant level. This change doesn't affect Granular delegated admin permissions (GDAP) or CSP users. |
| **What do you need to do?**         | If a user who isn't part of your Microsoft Entra requires access to finance and operations apps, that user must be added to the Microsoft Entra ID tenant as an external user or guest user. For more information, see [B2B collaboration overview](/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b/). |
| **Product areas affected**         | Finance and operations apps |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | End of support date is targeted for May 2024. |

## Feature deprecation effective April 2024

### Tokens without an environment URL in finance and operations apps 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To enhance security compliance, we're deprecating the use of tokens that aren't acquired with the resource or audience that's set as the environment URL in finance and operations apps. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | To ensure the security and integrity of your system and data, we strongly encourage all our customers to ensure that tokens are acquired only with the resource or audience that's set as the environment URL. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in API calls in finance and operations apps beginning to fail. We encourage all developers and administrators to update their token acquisition processes accordingly to avoid any disruption in API functionality. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Finance and operations apps |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | To enhance security compliance, support for tokens with an audience claim value other than the environment URL will be removed by April 2024 for non-production environments and by May 2024 for production environments. |

### Multitenant apps without a service principal in the Microsoft Entra ID tenant 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Multitenant apps that don't have a client service principal have been recognized as vulnerable, because they pose a significant risk of acquiring cross-tenant Open Authorization (OAuth) app-only tokens for multitenant services across arbitrary tenants. To address this security vulnerability, apps without a service principal in the tenant will no longer be authenticated. Finance and operations APIs will start to fail from these apps in deprecated environments. To review your onboarded applications, in finance and operations apps, go to **System administration** > **Setup** > **Microsoft Entra applications**. For information about how to review your onboarded applications, see [Register your external application](../../dev-itpro/data-entities/services-home-page.md#register-your-external-application). |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | To ensure the security and integrity of your system and data, we strongly encourage all our customers to provision the multitenant apps in their Microsoft Entra ID tenant. For more information, see [Create an enterprise application from a multi-tenant application](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant?pivots=ms-graph). Note â€“ If application onboarding isn't expected, remove that app or replace with a compliant app that has a client service principal in tenant. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Finance and operations apps |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Support for app-only tokens by multitenant apps that don't have a service principal ID will be removed by February 2024 for non-production environments and by April 2024 for production environments. |

## Feature deprecation effective March 2024

### Non Microsoft Entra ID external user sign-in 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | We're deprecating access for external users who aren't present in the Microsoft Entra ID tenant that's used for your finance and operations apps environment. Microsoft has identified this type of access as a security issue. For more information, see [Manually add a new user](../sysadmin/create-new-users.md#manually-add-a-new-user).|
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes, finance and operations apps already support business-to-business (B2B) collaboration that provides a secure way to provide access for external guest users. For more information, see [B2B collaboration overview](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b/). If you want, you can take proactive action by inviting and onboarding external users from the Microsoft Entra admin center. No changes are required through finance and operations apps. We'll share customer communications with affected customers, and will also share instructions for fixing this issue in version 10.0.35 or later of finance and operations apps. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Finance and operations apps |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated. End of support date is targeted for March 2024. |

## Feature deprecation effective February 2024

### ISV Licenses generated using SHA1 algorithm (signature version 1)  

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The SHA1 algorithm has been widely recognized as vulnerable to security breaches due to its susceptibility to collision attacks. To address this security requirement, imports for ISV licenses that are generated using the SHA1 cryptographic algorithm are longer supported. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | SHA256 - To ensure the security and integrity of your system and data, we strongly encourage all our customers to migrate to the more secure SHA256 algorithm for generating ISV licenses. 

Migrating to SHA256 is straightforward: You need to use signature version 2 or keep this field empty while generating license using AxUtil tool to generate a new license using SHA256. For more information, see [Independent software vendor (ISV) licensing](../../dev-itpro/dev-tools/isv-licensing.md). 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |

## Feature deprecation effective January 2024

### System Admin > Inquiries > User Log 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The **Inquiries** > **User Log** is a legacy page that was built for the older client/server architecture. The information on this page isn't always accurate and can be misleading. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | In finance and operations apps, this information is captured in telemetry and Lifecycle Services has details. For more information, see [Track user sign-ins](../../dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/user-logins.md). |
| **Product areas affected**         | System Administration  |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | The User Log page will be removed by Jan 12 2024 (10.0.38/PU62) |

### Exchange email provider

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The authentication mechanism that the Exchange email provider uses is being removed, and the Exchange provider never supported sovereign clouds. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Customers who use the Exchange email provider should migrate to the Microsoft Graph email provider. For more information, see [Configure and send email](../../dev-itpro/organization-administration/configure-email.md). |
| **Product areas affected**         | System administration  |
| **Deployment option**              | All |

Starting from 10.0.40 (PU 64), there may be SQL-related updates in FinOps that aren't compatible with older versions of MS SQL Server. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes, customers can use Microsoft SQL Server 15.x or higher with their Finance and Operations (Dynamics 365).|
| **Product areas affected**         | Finance and operations apps |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated. End of support date is targeted for 10.0.28 (PU 52), which went out of support on October 21, 2022. |

### Visual Studio add-in to apply metadata hotfixes

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Metadata hotfixes are no longer supported with the [One Version](../../dev-itpro/get-started/one-version.md) service updates that were introduced in July 2018 with version 8.1. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Individual metadata hotfixes aren't available for supported versions. Cumulative quality updates are applied instead. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio add-ins |
| **Deployment option**              | Development virtual machines |
| **Status**                         | With version 10.0.15, the add-in is no longer included in the Visual Studio tools. |


## Platform updates for version 10.0.14 of finance and operations apps

### Online users page 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | This is a legacy page that was built for previous client/server architecture. The information on this page isn't always accurate, which can be confusing and misleading. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | We'll provide a new page in a future update. As a workaround, use the table browser for the SysClientSessions table to view client sessions.|
| **Product areas affected**         | System Administration |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | This page will be removed in a future release.   |


## Platform updates for version 10.0.13 of finance and operations apps


### Custom code defined in SSRS report properties 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | In general, custom code offers limited benefits while at the same time, requires significant resourcing and compute to support. Custom code is primarily used by report authors to call public methods from a custom code assembly. However, the cloud-hosted service doesn't support references to custom assemblies for SSRS reports. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Report authors may choose to continue referencing public .NET APIs for Math, Conversion, and Format operations from any textbox expression. For more information, see [Add Code to a Report (SSRS)](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/add-code-to-a-report-ssrs).  |
| **Product areas affected**         | Subset of application report designs that are defined in RDL and contain custom code. |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | With version 10.0.13, the compiler begins issuing a warning for instances where custom code is detected in an SSRS report definition. To fix the issue, open the report design definition and remove all custom code artifacts. This warning will be replaced with a compiler error in a future update.   |

### Upgrade of three jQuery component libraries 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Three jQuery component libraries are being updated for security fixes and to maintain currency.   
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | The following libraries are being affected: jQuery (to version 3.5.0 from version 2.1.4), jQuery UI (to version 1.12.1 from version 1.11.4), jQuery qTip (to version 3.0.3 from 2.2.1). Migration guidance has been provided online by jQuery.  |
| **Product areas affected**         | Extensible controls, custom JavaScript code utilizing deprecated or removed APIs. |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | With version 10.0.13/Platform update 37, customers can optionally move to the latest libraries by enabling the "Upgrade three jQuery component libraries" feature. Moving to the new libraries are mandatory with the April 2021 release to allow time for migration of affected APIs.   |

### Existing grid control/forceLegacyGrid() API

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The existing grid control is being replaced by the new grid control. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | The [new grid control](../../dev-itpro/get-started/grid-capabilities.md) |
| **Product areas affected**         | Web client |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | The new grid control is mandatory with the October 2022 release (version 10.0.29). The **forceLegacyGrid()** API is currently still being honored if the old grid is still needed; however, this API is targeted to be deprecated by the October 2023 release. When the deprecation of this API is announced, it's available for at least 12 months before no longer being available. |

### Personalization without saved views 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The personalization subsystem has been overhauled with the saved views feature, so that it has better performance and offers more capabilities. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Saved views |
| **Product areas affected**         | Web client |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | In version 10.0.13/Platform update 37, the saved views feature is generally available, and customers can optionally turn on this feature. The saved views feature becomes mandatory in the October 2021 release. |


## Platform updates for version 10.0.12 of finance and operations apps

### Grid or group control from extensions containing invalid field references

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The data group property on grid or group controls is used to automatically show all the fields of a field group. A grid or group control added by extension could contain fields that are no longer defined on the field group, or it might be missing fields defined on the field group. This can cause inconsistent behavior at runtime. Platform updates for version 10.0.12 of finance and operations apps now categorize this issue as a compiler *warning*. To fix this issue, open the form extension and save it.
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | This compiler warning will be replaced with a compiler error in a future update. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio development tools |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | A compiler warning is introduced in platform updates for version 10.0.12 of finance and operations apps. |

## Platform updates for version 10.0.11 of finance and operations apps

### Explicit safe lists for self-service environments

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The process for moving IP to safe lists has changed. Self-service no longer supports IP safe lists. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | For more information, see [Configuring Conditional Access](/appcenter/general/configuring-aad-conditional-access).|
| **Product areas affected**         | Security |
| **Deployment option**              | Cloud |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: This feature is fully deprecated for self-service deployments. |

### Visual Studio 2015

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To support the latest versions of Visual Studio, some changes have to be made to the X++ extensions for Visual Studio. These changes are incompatible with Visual Studio 2015. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Visual Studio 2017 replaces Visual Studio 2015 as the deployed and required version. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio development tools |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Virtual machines deployed on version 10.0.13 (Platform update 37) or later contain Visual Studio 2017. Version 10.0.16 (Platform update 40) is the final release with support for Visual Studio 2015. Virtual machines with only Visual Studio 2015 can't update to version 10.0.17 (Platform update 41). |

### Field groups containing invalid field references

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Field groups in table metadata definitions can contain field references that aren't valid. If these field groups are deployed, they can cause runtime failures in Financial Reporting and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). Platform update 23 introduced a compiler *warning* that enabled this metadata issue to be addressed. Platform updates for version 10.0.11 of finance and operations apps categorize this issue as a compiler *error*.<p>To fix this issue, follow these steps.</p><ol><li>Remove the invalid field reference from the table field group definition.</li><li>Recompile.</li><li>Make sure that any errors are addressed.</li></ol> |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | This compiler error permanently replaces the compiler warning.  |
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio development tools |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: The compiler warning is a compiler error in platform updates for version 10.0.11 of finance and operations apps. |

### ISV licenses created by using the SHA1 hashing algorithm

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The process for creating independent software vendor (ISV) licenses has changed. For more information, see [Independent software vendor (ISV) licensing](../../dev-itpro/dev-tools/isv-licensing.md#appendix-create-self-signed-certificates-for-test-purposes). |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes. Use Windows PowerShell to create licenses. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Visual Studio development tools |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: ISV licenses that were created by using the SHA1 hashing algorithm. This algorithm depended on certificates that were created by using the MakeCert utility, and this utility has been deprecated.<br><br>Deprecated: The use of SHA1 for security or hashing purposes. SHA1 ceases to function in early 2021. Therefore, it should no longer be used.<br><br>Removed: Support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and TLS 1.1 incoming or outgoing requests. |

## Platform update 32

### Workflow request change dialog box no longer includes user selection drop-down list

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | The user selection drop-down list was a security issue because the request for change could be sent to an unintended user. This is a usability issue because it forced the user to determine who the workflow originator was and manually select them.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No |
| **Product areas affected**         | Workflow |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | The user selection drop-down list was removed from the request change dialog box in Platform update 32. Request change requests are automatically sent to the originator as intended. For more information about this functionality, see [Actions in workflow approval processes](../organization-administration/workflow-actions.md?toc=%2fdynamics365%2fcommerce%2ftoc.json#request-change). |

### Embedded drill-through links are no longer supported in paginated documents rendered by the cloud-hosted service 

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Navigation URLs embedded in documents rendered by the service may contain sensitive business data. We're removing support for embedded drill-through links in documents as a security precaution to further protect customer's data. Users benefit from improved performance while interactively producing documents as a result of this change.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No |
| **Product areas affected**         | Reporting |
| **Deployment option**              | All |
| **Status**                         | This feature is actively being removed from the service.<br><br>The modern client offers numerous options for producing views that include auto generated links to help navigating the application. Paginated documents rendered by the service are recommended for external communications that are emailed, archived, and printed for recipients. We have improved the experience for previewing documents directly in the browser, which offers direct access to local printers. For more information, see [Preview PDF documents with an embedded viewer](../../dev-itpro/analytics/preview-pdf-documents.md). |
