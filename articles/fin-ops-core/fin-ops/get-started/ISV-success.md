## Supplemental Preview Terms

These Supplemental Preview Terms (“Preview Terms”) are in addition to and supplement the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Insider Program Agreement (“Program Agreement” and, as supplemented by these Preview Terms, the “Agreement”) that Participant accepted.  All terms with the initial letters capitalized will have the same meaning given to them in the Program Agreement, unless otherwise specified in these Preview Terms.

### SECTION 1  DEFINITIONS. 

**“DRI”** means designated responsible individual.

 **“Dynamics Online Service”** means Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, or Commerce.
 
**“Solution Package”** means any software, data, media, service, or other materials that Participant developed for the Dynamics Online Service.

### SECTION 2	   GENERAL.

**2.1	 Scope of Services.**  Participant has domain expertise in the Solution Package that Customers obtained from Participant.  The Agreement governs how Microsoft will transfer to Participant support issues reported by customers that deployed Participant’s Solution Package to run on or work with the Dynamics Online Service (“Customer”).  Participant will fix the support issues and provide a Resolution (defined in Section 3.4) to Customers at no additional cost to Microsoft.  

**2.2	 Duration of the Preview.**  The term of this Preview begins on the date Participant accepts these Preview Terms and ends on July 1, 2019 (“Term”).

### SECTION 3	   SUPPORT TO CUSTOMERS.

**3.1	 Consent.**  If Microsoft is contacted by a Customer about a technical support issue and Microsoft determines it needs to transfer the support issue to Participant because it originates out of Participant’s Solution Package, Microsoft will obtain the necessary consent from the Customer prior to such transfer.  

**3.2	 On-Call DRI.**  Participant will ensure a DRI support personnel is available and on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, during the Private Preview Term (including Public Holidays) to fix technical support issues with the Solution Package.  Participant will provide Microsoft with a single dedicated cellphone number for Participant’s DRI support personnel who will be on-call during the Term.  For purposes of these Private Preview Terms, “Public Holiday” means any calendar day other than a business day, which includes bank holidays, national holidays, or other holidays publicly recognized by the federal government of the country/region where Participant’s principal place of business is located.

**3.3	 Requesting Support.**  To request technical support for the Solution Package from Participant, Microsoft will submit a request in English (“Support Request”) to Participant via phone call and email.  If a Support Request consists of subordinate issues, Microsoft will inform Participant and Microsoft will determine whether to designate each subordinate issue as a separate Support Request.  Each Support Request Microsoft provides must include: (A) a severity rating of the problem using the rating scale set forth in Table 1; (B) a reasonably detailed description of the problem; (C) Microsoft’s troubleshooting activities to identify the root cause; (D) the name of the Customer and the country or region where the Customer is located; and (E) the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) project ID number for the Customer’s production environment of the Dynamics Online Service.

   **3.3.1	Severity Ratings and Response Times.**  Participant will provide Microsoft with a response to each Support Request within the response times specified in Table 1, based on the severity Microsoft assigns to the Support Request.
