# Features not implemented in on-premises deployments

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic lists features that have not been implemented in deployments of Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises). The topic is divided into two sections:

- The first section lists features that haven't been implemented yet. These features are not deprecated.
- The second section lists features that are not intended for use with on-premises deployments. There are no plans to implement these features.

## Features not yet implemented

The following features have not yet been implemented in on-premises deployments. These features have not been deprecated. If these features are critical to your on-premises deployment, please let us know by providing feedback on the [Ideas](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/) site.

| Feature                                                          | Description |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Task recorder                                                    | Task recorder libraries in Lifecycle Services (LCS) are not supported. Task recordings can be loaded from or saved to the local file system. |
| **Support** pane                                                 | The **Support** pane (**Help & Support** \> **Support**) is not yet available. |
| PowerBI.com integration                                          | PowerBI.com integration is not yet available for on-premises deployments. For example, the ability to pin a tile or a report from your PowerBI.com subscription to a workspace is not available. |
| Recurring integrations API                                       | The use of recurring data jobs through the recurring integrations API framework are not supported. You can only use the data management framework package API with on-premises deployments. |
| Microsoft Office integration                                             | SharePoint on-premises support is not yet available. SharePoint online is also not yet supported (due to an authentication issue).<br><br>Skype for Business on-premises is not supported.  |
| Electronic reporting (ER) integration with LCS                   | The ER integration with LCS is not supported. ER configurations can't be downloaded directly from LCS.                                   |
| ER integration with SharePoint            | Integration with SharePoint is not supported. SharePoint server can't be configured as a destination for electronic documents generated by using ER.                           |
| Business document management            | It is not possible to use the Business document management feature to edit the templates used to generate business documents. You can only use the ER framework. This is because Microsoft Office integration is not yet available for on-premises deployments.                           |
| Author Power BI reports using OData                              | Authoring Power BI reports with OData using Power BI desktop or Excel PowerQuery tools is not supported.                                                                                  |
|Purchase requisitions: Punch-out from external catalogs |It is not possible to check out a shopping cart from an external catalog to a purchase requisition. |
|Trace Parser and PerfTimer |These tools are not working or have limited functionality for this release. These features will be implemented in a future release. |
|SSRS scale out  |Currently SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) does not support scaling out. This feature will be added in a future release. |
|Telemetry  |Currently no telemetry is transferred into the cloud. In a future update we will start transferring telemetry data into the cloud. |
|Data task automation  |[Data task automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-task-automation) is not currently implemented. |

## Features not intended for use in on-premises deployments

The following features are not intended for use in on-premises deployments. There are no plans to implement these features in on-premises deployments.

| Feature                    | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| SSRS Report Viewer control | SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) does not support a report viewer control that is compatible with the on-premises web client.<p>Reports are rendered as PDF documents by the on-premises service. Use extensions to enable embedded drill-thru links in application reports.</p> |
| Document Routing Agent     | This component is not necessary for on-premises deployments. On-premises deployments are hosted on domain-authenticated servers. This offers secure, direct access to network printer devices. |
