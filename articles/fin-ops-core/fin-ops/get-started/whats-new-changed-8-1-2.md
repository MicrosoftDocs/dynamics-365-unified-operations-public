### Dynamics 365 October '18 release notes

Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in any of our business apps or platform?

[Check out the October '18 release notes](/dynamics365/release-plans/). We've captured all the details, end to end, top to bottom, in a single document that you can use for planning.

## Bug fixes

For information about the bug fixes included in each of the updates that are part of Platform update 22, sign in to Lifecycle Services (LCS) and view the [KB article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2037783).

## Platform update 22

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations version 8.1.2 includes Platform update 22. To learn more about Platform update 22, see [What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations platform update 22 (December 2018)](whats-new-platform-update-22.md).

## Extensibility enhancements

In this release of Finance and Operations, numerous extensibility enhancements have been made to support extensibility including enhancements to enumerations, metadata, and methods. For detailed information, see [Extensibility changes in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations version 8.1.2](../../dev-itpro/extensibility/extensibility-changes-812.md).

## Derived dimension values

This release includes functionality that lets you prevent changes to derived dimension values and override existing dimension values with derived dimension values. For more information, see [Financial dimensions](../../../finance/general-ledger/financial-dimensions.md).

## Resume master planning
This release includes enhanced planning engine functionality that helps to ensure that master planning batch jobs automatically resume if the main thread stops unexpectedly. This can happen if, for some reason, the batch server connection is lost during the master planning run. Before this feature was implemented, a complete rerun of master planning was needed. Now the master planning batch jobs automatically resume and continue at the place where they were interrupted. From the Master planning history log, the planner can see that the main thread was stopped unexpectedly and that the process was resumed.

Resume will only happen once. This means that if the main thread unexpectedly stops again, during the resume, it will mark it as failed in the log and not try to resume. Also, resume is only applied to regeneration and jobs that have reached at least the coverage state of the master planning calculation. If a helper thread stops unexpectedly, planning will continue with the remaining helpers.

## Intrastat format changes for Belgium
This release includes changes to the XML Intrastat format for Belgium that applies to reporting for 2019. To apply the new format, you need to import the following version (or a later version) of the ER configuration from the LCS shared asset library: Intrastat (BE).version.2.6.xml. For more information about how to import configurations, see [ER Import a configuration from Lifecycle Services](../../dev-itpro/analytics/tasks/er-import-configuration-lifecycle-services.md). 

## India-specific features
In this release, if [GTE](../../../finance/general-ledger/tax-engine.md) is enabled for a legal entity, some global fields and buttons will be hidden from the user interface. This simplifies the user interface for users by hiding fields and buttons on taxable documents like Purchase orders and Sales order that don't apply when GTE is used. The following fields or buttons will be hidden if GTE is enabled.

 - Sales tax group
 - Item sales tax group
 - Sales tax button
 
The current standard GST configuration does not include VAT, so if your business needs to handle VAT, you must extend the configuration to use VAT. For more information, see [Extending tax engine configurations](../../../finance/general-ledger/extend-tax-engine-configurations.md).
