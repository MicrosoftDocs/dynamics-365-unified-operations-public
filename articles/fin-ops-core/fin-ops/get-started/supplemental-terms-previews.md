# Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Previews 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations may include preview, beta, or other pre-release features, services, software, or regions offered by Microsoft to obtain customer feedback ("Previews"). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement [your agreement](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Legal) governing use of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. 

PREVIEWS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE", AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND LIMITED WARRANTY. PREVIEWS ARE NOT FOR USE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.  Previews may not be covered by customer support. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments, as further explained in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131004&clcid=0x409), [Microsoft Dynamics Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/cloudservices/dynamics365), the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31), and any additional notices provided with the Preview. Customers should not use Previews to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into "General Availability".
