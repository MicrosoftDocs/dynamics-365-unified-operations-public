This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations version 10.0.3. This version will be released in June and has a build number of 10.0.107. For more information about version 10.0.3, see [Additional resources](whats-new-changed-10-0-3.md#additional-resources).

## Feature management

The **Feature management** experience provides a workspace where you can view a list of features that have been delivered in each release. By default, new features are turned off. You can use the workspace to turn them on and view the documentation for them.

For more information, see [Feature management](./feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Enable Bank foreign currency revaluation without a parameter
Bank foreign currency revaluation was released in version 10.0.2 and it included a parameter in Cash and Bank parameters to enable it. You can now enable bank foreign currency revaluation for all legal entities where it is available using feature management. 

For more information, see [Bank foreign currency revaluation](../../../finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md#enable-foreign-currency-revaluation).

## Expense reports re-imagined
Expense report entry has been redesigned to simplify and decrease the time to complete your expense report. You can enable this functionality in feature management to add a new setup form to configure expense fields visibility to determine what data is required, optional, or not enabled for entering expense reports. A new expense workspace is enabled with this feature, replacing the previous expense workspace and is the landing page for the improved entry experience. 

For more information, see [Expense reports re-imagined](/dynamics365/project-operations/prod-exp/ExpenseWorkspaceNew).

## Extensibility enhancements

In this release of Finance and Operations, numerous enhancements have been made to support extensibility. For example, extensibility enhancements have been made to enumerations, metadata, and methods. For detailed information, see [Extensibility changes in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations version 10.0.3](../../dev-itpro/extensibility/extensibility-changes-10-3.md).

## Tax engine

> [!NOTE]
> The tax engine (GTE) is currently only available for India.

### Calculate tax in accounting currency for Import/Export Order

In this release of Finance and Operations, a new parameter is added to the **Tax setup parameters** page, which allows user to choose based on which currency the tax should be calculated for Import/Export Order. By default, the **Transaction currency** allows you to choose which currency the tax should be calculated for an import/export order. By default, the **Transaction currency** is the same as the original system behavior. If you choose **Accounting currency**, the system will calculate the tax based on the assessable value in accounting currency.
