# Change the banner or logo

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The following procedure lists the steps that system administrators can use to update the banner or logo image that is displayed for a legal entity. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.

1. Go to **Navigation pane > Modules > Organization administration > Organizations > Legal entities**.
2. In the list on the left, select the legal entity for which you want to update the banner or logo. If it is already selected, go to the next step.
3. Expand **Dashboard image** tab.
4. Select **Change**.
    
    The ideal resolution for a banner image is 1920 x 281 pixels. The ideal width for a logo image is 350 pixels.
    
5. Select **Save**.
6. Go to **Navigation pane > Modules > Common > Common > Default dashboard**. You should see the new banner or logo image on the dashboard.  
    
    You may need to change your company, using the company picker, to the one you uploaded the banner for.
