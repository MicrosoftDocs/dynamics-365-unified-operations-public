## Recovering vendor invoices that are in use

You can use the **Recover vendor invoices** page to recover or release vendor invoices that have been in use for more than four hours, so that they can be edited. You can open this page from the **Periodic task** navigation link or a tile on the **Vendor invoice entry** workspace. After an invoice is recovered, it will be available for editing on the **Vendor invoice** page.

For more information, see [Vendor invoices overview](../../../finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md).
  
## Bank foreign currency revaluation

As part of a period end, some accounting practices require that bank account balances in foreign currencies be revalued by using different exchange rate types (current, historical, average, and so on). The bank foreign currency revaluation feature can be used to revalue one or more bank accounts. The is also a global feature, which means that from a single page, you can revalue banks across all the legal entities that you have access to.
  
## Create project-based sales orders for projects with a funding source of type Grant

This feature provides support for the creation of project-based sales orders for time and material projects funded by a grant on the related project contract. The customer assigned as the contact for the grant will be the customer on the sales order.
