# AxErd page has been retired

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

We've unfortunately had to retire the AxErd web page from the `microsoft.com` domain. However, AxErd may still be available elsewhere, hosted by third parties.

AxErd provided Entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) for many Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 tables.

## Source on GitHub

We've been able to post both the source code for the project, and the HTML files for the web page, in a GitHub repo: https://github.com/Microsoft/ax-2012-doc-tools

The HTML pages are in the repo, at [https://github.com/Microsoft/ax-2012-doc-tools/tree/master/AxErd/AxErd/_RelatedFiles_AxErd/Deploy/Default.htm](https://github.com/Microsoft/ax-2012-doc-tools/tree/master/AxErd/AxErd/_RelatedFiles_AxErd/Deploy/Default.htm)

A description of how to create your own ERDs is at: [https://github.com/Microsoft/ax-2012-doc-tools/blob/master/AxErd/AxErd/_RelatedFiles_AxErd/Deploy/Help-HowToUse-AxErd.htm](https://github.com/Microsoft/ax-2012-doc-tools/blob/master/AxErd/AxErd/_RelatedFiles_AxErd/Deploy/Help-HowToUse-AxErd.htm)

The solution is at the root of the AxErd folder [https://github.com/Microsoft/ax-2012-doc-tools/tree/master/AxErd](https://github.com/Microsoft/ax-2012-doc-tools/tree/master/AxErd).

## AxErd resurrected on third-party website

In March 2018, a third party copied the AxErd source from GitHub, and redeployed AxErd at the following site. The site is still operating as of March 2020:
