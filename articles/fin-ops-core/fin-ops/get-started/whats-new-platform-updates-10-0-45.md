| System Administration | Batch Telemetry integrates with Application Insights | As an enhancement to the existing **Monitoring and Telemetry** feature, the platform is expanding its capabilities to include **Batch telemetry integration with Application Insights**. This update introduces a robust telemetry pipeline that enables visibility into critical batch job behaviors directly within the customer's Azure Application Insights instance. Teams can monitor execution timelines, detect throttling, track task distribution, and capture failure diagnostics to eliminate the need for manual incident reporting. This feature isn't limited to future releases. It will also be **backported to version 10.0.44**, ensuring broader availability and immediate impact for customers seeking improved observability and reduced operational overhead.

- A *removed* feature isn't available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

Deprecation notices appear in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](../../fin-ops/get-started/removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) article 12 months before any feature is removed.
