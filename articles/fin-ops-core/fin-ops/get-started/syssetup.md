# About SysSetup

SysSetup is an interface that is used to identify the X++ classes that run during DBSync. The X++ classes that implement the SysSetup interface run during the **PostTableAndViewSyncActions** step during a DBSync. 

## Onboarding to SysSetup - 
1. From Microsoft Visual Studio, select **View** --> **Application explorer (AOT)**, and then create a new class that implements SysSetup interface. 
2. Add the **loadData()** method in the class. The code in this method is run during DBSync. (It can also be a reference to another class or method.)
3. Add the [SysSetupConfig](../dev-itpro/dev-tools/syssetupconfigattribute.md) and SysSetupTable attributes to the class. 
4. SysSetupTable attribute takes the related table as the input. 

```xpp
[
    SysSetupTable(tablestr(DemoTable)),
    SysSetupConfig(true, 300, 1.1)
]
class DemoSetup implements SysSetup
{
    public void loadData()
    {
        <your code here..>
    }
}
```

> [!Note]
> Running DBSync from Visual Studio will not run the SysSetup classes. See below to run DBSync from the command line. 

## Validating New Classes

1. Open the command prompt. 
1. Run the following command.</br>  
   Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Deployment.Setup.exe -bindir "<AOSInstalledDirectory>\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory" -metadatadir <AOSInstalledDirectory>\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory -sqluser <sqluser> -sqlserver <sqlservername/localhost> -sqldatabase <axdbname> -setupmode sync -syncmode fullall -isazuresql false -sqlpwd <password> -logfilename "<anydirectory>\dbsync.log"</br>
   </br>
   For example: Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Deployment.Setup.exe -bindir "K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory" -metadatadir K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory -sqluser <sqluser> -sqlserver localhost -sqldatabase axdb -setupmode sync -syncmode fullall -isazuresql false -sqlpwd <password> -logfilename "K:\temp\dbsync.log"
   
After the command has run, check the log entry to confirm the X++ class was picked up and executed during DBSync. You will see an entry similar to the example below.
