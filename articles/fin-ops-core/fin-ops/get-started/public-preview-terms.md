# Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Previews

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

These Supplemental Terms of Use ("Terms") cover use of those Microsoft Dynamics 365 previews that link to these Terms.

## General terms

Dynamics 365 may include preview, beta, or other pre-release features, services, or software, 
offered by Microsoft to obtain customer feedback ("Previews").  Previews are made available to you 
on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement your agreement governing 
use of Dynamics 365. 

PREVIEWS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS", "WITH ALL FAULTS", AND "AS AVAILABLE", AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM
THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND LIMITED WARRANTY.  Previews may not be covered by customer
support.  Preview may be subject to reduce or different security, compliance and privacy
commitments, as further explained in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131004&clcid=0x409 "Microsoft Privacy Statement"), [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/product-overview "Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trust Center"), the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31 "Online Services Terms"), and any additional notices provided with the Preview.

Customers should not use Previews to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to 
heightened compliance requirements.  In addition, Customers should not use Previews in a 'live 
operating' or production environment.  Certain named Previews may also be subject to additional 
terms, if any, set forth below.  We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice.
We also may choose not to release a Preview into "General Availability".

You will provide, as your own expense, the equipment, technology, and infrastructure necessary
to participate in the Previews, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Preview program 
description.  In addition, you may use consultants, contractors, advisors, or other third parties 
to assist with performing the activities or any professional services in connection with the 
Preview, but only if you have entered into an agreement with any such third party that contains 
terms at least as protective of Microsoft's rights as those in the Agreement.  You will bear all 
costs and expenses associated with engaging a third party to perform any of your activities in the 
Previews.  You may use the Preview only if you have a valid license or subscription to the 
required Dynamics 365 application.  You may not access or use the Previews if you do not have the 
required license or subscription.

## Use Preview in a Production Environment

The "General Terms" section applies generally to all Previews that link to these Terms.  This 
section contains terms that apply only if a Preview allows you to use Customer Data or Personal 
Data (collectively "Data") in a 'live operating' or production environment and is in addition to 
the General Terms.  These "Use Preview in a Production Environment" terms govern if there are any 
conflicts with the "General Terms" or the "Service-Specific Terms" sections.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the General Terms, Microsoft hereby grants you 
permission to use the Preview to access or process Data in a 'live operating' or production 
environment in connection with participating in the Preview.  By accessing or processing Data 
in a 'live operations' or production environment, you consent to share your Data with external 
systems outside of the geography where your production environment is deployed.

## Service-specific terms

The "General Terms" section applies generally to all Previews that link to these Teams.  These 
service-specific terms are in addition to the "General Terms" and the "Use Preview in a Production 
Environment" sections.  These service-specific terms govern if there are any conflicts with the 
"General Terms" or the "Use Preview in a Production Environment" sections.

personal to that business which do not include (i) redistribution of the software to third 
parties, or (ii) creation of content compliant with the VIDEO STANDARDS technologies for 
distribution to third parties.  If there is any inconsistency between the Agreement and these 
Preview terms of use, then to the extent of such inconsistency, these Preview terms of use will 
control over the conflicting terms in the Agreement.

grants you permission to use the Software Development Kit and the Store Starter Kit (collectively, 
the "software") in a 'live operating or production environment for Dynamics 365 Commerce.  If you
