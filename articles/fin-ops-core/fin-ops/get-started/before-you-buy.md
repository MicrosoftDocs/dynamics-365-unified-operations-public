# Before you buy

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

New to Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, or Dynamics 365 Commerce? Use the following step-by-step guidance whether you're still evaluating or ready to make a purchase.

## Step one: Try out finance and operations free for 30 days

You can try Dynamics 365 for Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, or Dynamics 365 Commerce for 30 days through a simple email signup. The trial version of finance and operations applications includes Getting started task guides that provide step-by-step instructions that allow you to view specific scenarios in action. You can explore the product and exercise scenarios, but you can't customize it. Demo data is included to ease the use of the product and to make the experience more meaningful. A reminder email is sent three days before the trial expires. For more information, see [Sign up for preview subscriptions](../../dev-itpro/dev-tools/sign-up-preview-subscription.md#subscribe).

## Step two: Choose a deployment option

You can now deploy finance and operations applications in the cloud or on-premises. Cloud deployments offer an ERP service that Microsoft fully manages, while on-premises deployments are deployed locally within a customer's data center.

Consider the following factors when you choose on-premises as a deployment option:

- Regulatory and compliance needs that aren't available in the cloud certifications.
- Disconnected business process with intermittent internet connectivity required to access Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services for application lifecycle management.
- [Comparison of cloud and on-premises features](../../dev-itpro/get-started/cloud-prem-comparison.md).
- [System requirements for on-premises deployments](../../dev-itpro/get-started/system-requirements-on-prem.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On-premises deployments aren't supported on any public cloud infrastructure, including Microsoft Azure. However, they're supported to run on [Microsoft Azure Stack HCI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-stack/hci/) and [Microsoft Azure Stack Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-stack/hub/).

For more information, see [Deployment options](../../dev-itpro/deployment/choose-deployment-type.md).

## Step three: Buy and manage a subscription

To explore subscription options, go to the [Dynamics 365 pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/pricing) page. This page includes several different plans to fit your organization's needs.

You can buy a subscription in many ways:

- Buy through a Cloud solution provider (cloud only).
- Buy through a partner, and use volume licensing (cloud or on-premises).
- Buy through a partner from the Dynamics price list (on-premises only).

### Buy through a Cloud solution provider (cloud-only)

A Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider can work closely with you to understand the needs of your business or organization. Use the [Microsoft Partner Center portal](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/partner/home) to find a partner to fit your needs.

### Buy through a Dynamics partner (on-premises)

You must work with a partner to purchase Finance + Operations (on-premises). For more information, see [Buy Finance + Operations (on-premises)](../../dev-itpro/get-started/purchase-on-premises.md).

### Buy through volume licensing (cloud or on-premises)

If your organization has 250 or more Dynamics 365 users, you might be interested in a [Volume licensing agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/product-licensing/dynamics365).

In volume licensing, finance and operations applications are available through:

- Enterprise Agreement
- Enterprise Agreement Subscription
- Enrollment for Education Solutions (under the Campus and School Agreement)
- Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA)

### Choose your support option

Microsoft provides flexible, industry-leading support, services, and resources that enable you to quickly address technical issues and maximize return on your Dynamics 365 investment. Choose a plan that best meets your business requirements.

## Step four: Learn about FastTrack and plan your deployment

Microsoft FastTrack for Dynamics 365 is a customer success service designed to help you move to Dynamics 365 smoothly and confidently, so you can realize business value faster. When you participate in the FastTrack program, you receive guidance on best practices and how to plan for successful rollouts.
