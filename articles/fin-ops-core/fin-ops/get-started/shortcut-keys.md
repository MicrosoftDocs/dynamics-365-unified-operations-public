# Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can help you quickly and efficiently enter data in finance and operations apps. 

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts described here refer to the United States keyboard layout. Keys on other keyboard layouts might not correspond exactly to the keys on a US keyboard.

Some of the shortcuts on this page are *key chords*, meaning they require two consecutive sets of key combinations (separated by a comma) that need to be independently pressed to trigger the required action. For example, the shortcut "Alt+M,A" requires the user to first press "Alt+M", release the keys, and then press "A". 

## Finding a shortcut

Users can discover currently available shortcuts directly from the user interface. Simply right-click on a control and select **View shortcuts**. This will open a dialog box showing the shortcuts you can use based on where you are on the page. Alternatively, you can press Alt+Shift+K to open this dialog box (and press Alt+Shift+K a second time to see all currently available shortcuts for the page).

## Focus management 
Focus management describes how user focus is handled in an application. Finance and operations apps have specialized focus behaviors that are intended to optimize user productivity, especially for data entry scenarios. Focus behaviors include the following:  

-  When a page is loaded, the first editable input control on the page will have focus and can accept user input immediately. If there is no editable input control on the page, the fallback option for initial focus is the first input control on the page followed by the first, focusable control on the page.   
-  Typically when a button is selected, the action is processed and focus may return to the page. When this happens, focus tends to return to the button control that was selected. This is true in finance and operations apps **except** when the button is located in the Action Pane or on a toolbar. In these cases, when the action completes, focus returns to the last control *outside* of the Action Pane (or toolbar) that had focus before the button was selected.
