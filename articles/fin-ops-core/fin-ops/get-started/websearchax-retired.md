# WebSearchAX page has been retired

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

We've had to retire the WebSearchAX page. We recommend that you use site search from your favorite search engine to replace it. For example:

site:technet.microsoft.com dynamics ax 2012 "search term"

–or–

site:msdn.microsoft.com dynamics ax 2012 "search term"
