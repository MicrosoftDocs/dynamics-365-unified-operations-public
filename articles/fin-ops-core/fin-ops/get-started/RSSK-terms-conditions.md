[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Store Starter Kit (Public Preview)

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft
services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are
accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms
apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to
pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT.

**INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**

1.	**Internal Use.** You may (i) install and use any number of copies of
the software to develop and test your customization packages you create
for use with your websites; and (ii) modify your copies of the software,
but you may not modify the software provided by Microsoft. The websites
you create with the software are for your internal use only and may be
accessible and used solely by your employees and consultants.

1.	**Test Transactions.** You may perform test transactions through the
websites you create with the software solely using testable credit card
primary account numbers to simulate the transactions, but do not result
in processing an actual transaction.

1.	**Limitations.** You may not (i) deploy your websites to a live
production environment of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations; (ii)
distribute the software or your customization packages to third parties;
or (iii) deploy websites that you create with the software for third
parties to access over the Internet, unless Microsoft permits you to do
so under another agreement. Microsoft may add or remove components from
the software from time to time.

1.	**Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Subscription.** Use
of the software requires a valid Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations
subscription. Your access to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations
through the software must comply with the existing terms for the service
that apply to you through your subscription license. You may lose access
to the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations online service (i) if
your Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations subscription license
expires or is terminated, or (ii) your license to this software is
terminated.

1.	**Compliance Obligations.** Any websites you develop with the software
that interoperate with an instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and
Operations online service must comply with the obligations of any third
party materials that you incorporated into such websites, including but
not limited to the inclusion of a Notices file. You are solely
responsible for all compliance with respect to any third party materials
included in your websites.


**ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.** 

1.	**Extensible Code.** The software may include sample code, modules,
templates, styles, or text files (available in the SRC folder in the GitHub
repository for the software) that you, or your consultants, are permitted to
modify (“Modifiable Code”). You may copy, modify, and incorporate copies of
the modified version of the Modifiable Code only in the customization
package that you develop for your websites and for use only for your
internal business purposes. Microsoft is not responsible for any problems
that result from modifications made to the Modifiable Code. Microsoft will
not provide technical or other support for any modifications made to the
Modifiable Code.

1.	**Third Party Images and Videos.** The software may include third party
images and videos that are for personal use only and may not be copied
except as provided by Microsoft within the demo websites. You may install
and use an unlimited number of copies of the demo websites., You may not
publish, rent, lease, lend, or redistribute any images or videos without
authorization from the rights holder, except and only to the extent that the
applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so.

**PACKAGE MANAGERS.** The software includes package managers that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages to use with your customization packages. Those packages obtained through a package manager are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license, or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.


**THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.** The software may include third party applications that are licensed to you under this agreement or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, for the third party applications may be accessible online at <https://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices> or in an accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.

**TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.**

1.	**Period.** This agreement is effective on your acceptance and terminates on
first availability of a commercial release of the software or (ii) upon
termination by Microsoft. Microsoft may extend this agreement in its
discretion.

1.	**Notice.** You may receive periodic reminder notices of this date through
the software.

1.	**Access to data.** You may not be able to access data used in the software
when it stops running.


**PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.** The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may be different from the commercially released version.

**FEEDBACK.** If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement

**DATA COLLECTION**. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your applications that access or use the software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft’s data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839>. You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

**SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):

1. work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;

1.	reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or attempt to do
so, except and only to the extent permitted by licensing terms governing the
use of open-source components that may be included with the software;

1.	remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers
in the software;

1.	use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or
propagate malware; or

1.	share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a
stand-alone hosted solution for others to use (except as set forth in
Section 1(b)), or transfer the software or this agreement to any third
party.

**EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit <https://aka.ms/exporting>.

**SUPPORT SERVICES.** Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.

**UPDATES.** The software may periodically check for updates and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.

**ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.

**APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.** If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

**CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

1.	Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.

1.	Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or
uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

1.	Germany and Austria.

  i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.

  ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.


**DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

**LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. \$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in
this agreement are provided below in French.

Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce
contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel
». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft
n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits
additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce
contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les
garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier
et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 \$ US.
Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y
compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.

Cette limitation concerne:
- tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et

- les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la
limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion
ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si
celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
