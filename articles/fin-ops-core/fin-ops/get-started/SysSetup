# About SysSetup

SysSetup is an interface and this interface is used to identify the X++ classes that are to be executed during DBSync. X++ classes that implements SysSetup interface are executed as a part of DBSync step "PostTableAndViewSyncActions". 

## Onboarding to SysSetup - 
1. From Visual Studio --> View --> Application explorer (AOT), create a new class that implements SysSetup interface. 
2. Add loadData() method in the class and the code in this method gets executed during DBSync. (it can also be a reference to another class/method.)
3. Add [SysSetupConfig](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/syssetupconfigattribute) and SysSetupTable attributes to the class. 
4. SysSetupTable attribute takes related table as the input. 

```xpp
[
    SysSetupTable(tablestr(DemoTable)),
    SysSetupConfig(true, 300, 1.1)
]
class DemoSetup implements SysSetup
{
    public void loadData()
    {
        <your code here..>
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running DBSync from Visual Studio will not run SysSetup classes. See below for running DBSync from command line. 

## Validating New Classes - 
1. Open command prompt. 
2. Run below command - 

Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Deployment.Setup.exe -bindir "<AOSInstalledDirectory>\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory" -metadatadir <AOSInstalledDirectory>\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory -sqluser <sqluser> -sqlserver <sqlservername/localhost> -sqldatabase <axdbname> -setupmode sync -syncmode fullall -isazuresql false -sqlpwd <password> -logfilename "<anydirectory>\dbsync.log"

For example: 
Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Deployment.Setup.exe -bindir "K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory" -metadatadir K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory -sqluser <sqluser> -sqlserver localhost -sqldatabase axdb -setupmode sync -syncmode fullall -isazuresql false -sqlpwd <password> -logfilename "K:\temp\dbsync.log"

3. After the completetion of command, you can check the log entry to confirm whether the X++ class got picked up and executed during DBSync.
