    - Use this form to view the status of a document that was submitted to the workflow system for processing and approval.  
    - The **Instance ID** is the identification code of the workflow instance that is processing, or has processed the document.  
    - The **Status** is the workflow status of the document.  
    - The **Workflow ID** is the identification code of the workflow that is processing, or has processed the document.  
    - The **Document** is the identification code of the document.  
    - The **Document type** is the type of document that was submitted for processing.  
    - The **Workflow** is the name of the workflow that is processing, or has processed the document.  
    - The **Version** is the version number of the workflow that is processing, or has processed the document.
