# Create an operating unit

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

An operating unit is an organization that is used to divide the control of economic resources and operational processes in a business. People in an operating unit have a duty to maximize the use of scarce resources, improve processes, and account for their performance. The types of operating units include cost centers, business units, departments, and value streams. Use the following procedure to create an operating unit. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.

1. Go to **Navigation pane > Modules > Organization administration > Organizations > Operating units.**
2. Click **New** to open the drop dialog.
3. In the list, find and select the desired record. Select the type of operating unit you want to create.  
4. In the list, click the link in the selected row.
5. In the **Name** field, type a value.
    + Expand the **General** section, if necessary.  
    + Provide general information about the operating unit, such as an identification number, DUNS number, and manager.    
    + Expand the **Addresses** section, if necessary.  
    + Enter address information, such as the street name and number, postal code, and city. Click **Add** to enter a new address record, or click Edit to modify an existing address record.   
    + Expand the **Contact information** section, if necessary.  
    + Enter information about methods of communication, such as email addresses, URLs, and telephone numbers. To enter a new communication record, click New. To modify an existing communication record, click **More options > Advanced**.   
6. Optionally, change the **Operating unit number** as needed. Note that this number is a unique idenitifier for the corresponding **Party** record and cannot be the same as any other operating unit.
