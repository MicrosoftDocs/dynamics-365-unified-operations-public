# Configure and send email

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The behavior of the email subsystem is influenced by a combination of administrator configuration, user configuration, and user choices. This article is divided into sections for administrators and users to make it easy to find relevant information.

Both administrators and users set the behavior of the email subsystem.

## [Administrator] Email parameters page 

### Configuration tab
On the **Email parameters** page, note the following settings on the **Configuration** tab.

| Field                 | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Batch email provider  | Specifies which email provider will be used to send emails that are sent by processes in a batch or non-interactive manner. The Exchange provider will use the account associated with the batch process. |
| Attachment size limit | Specifies the maximum size of a single email that can be sent via the email subsystem. |

The **Email history** section serves two purposes. First, it provides an entry point to the **Email history** page, where administrators can review all sent emails and also any errors that prevented an email from being sent. Second, it lets you configure how long email history is maintained. By default, the last 30 days of email history are retained. You can adjust this period by changing the value of the **Number of days to retain email history** field to a non-zero number. If you set the value to **0** (zero), the default number and behavior are used.

In version 10.0.16, an **Email throttling** section is visible if the **Email throttling** feature has been turned on for your environment in Feature management. This feature enables non-interactive email providers (such as the batch email provider) to adhere to a per-minute sending limit. Therefore, it can help prevent some errors if the system tries to send more emails than the provider allows. Specifically, if an email can't be originally sent because the per-minute sending limit has been reached, the send attempt for the email will be deferred for up to one minute. After ten deferrals, the system will try to send the email even if the per-minute sending limit has been reached. The sending limits for Microsoft 365 email providers are automatically set according to [Exchange Online sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits). Manual configuration is required for all other email providers. You can remove the per-minute sending limit from a provider by resetting the **per-minute email sending limit** field to **0**.

### SMTP settings tab
On the **Email parameters** page, note the following settings on the **SMTP settings** tab.

## [Administrator] Email distributor batch process

Email that is sent directly from the server, without user interaction, via SMTP is sent by the **Email distributor batch** process. That batch process must be started to process the email queue. To start the process, open the **Email distributor batch** pane (**System administration** &gt; **Periodic tasks** &gt; **Email processing** &gt; **Batch**) and turn on **Batch processing**.

If the Exchange provider is used, then the user account associated with the batch process (usually admin) will be the sender.

## [Administrator] User email

The default **send from** address for each user is pulled from the **Email** field on the **Users** page (**System administration** &gt; **Users** &gt; **Users**). Administrators can override this **send from** default if needed using the **Sender email** field on the **Options** page.

## [User] Email provider selection section on the Options page

The **Options** page can be opened via **Settings &gt; User options**. The **Email provider selection** section is on the **Account** tab.

| Field             | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Email provider ID | Allows the user to select the email provider that should be used when sending an email. Selecting an option here is the equivalent of selecting **Do not ask again** in the **How would you like to send email** dialog box. Selecting the blank option **Prompt for which email provider to use** will cause the **How would you like to send email** dialog box to display when an email is going to be sent. |
| Sender email    | Allows the administrator to provide an email address override for the user in the **From** field of the email. By default, the email alias that is associated with the user account is used as the **From** field in new emails, but this user option email address will override that. When sending email via SMTP, the user needs to have appropriate **Send As** and **Send On Behalf Of** permissions configured in Exchange or on the SMTP server.<blockquote>[!NOTE] You can configure **Send As** and **Send On Behalf Of** permissions in the Microsoft 365 admin center (portal.office.com/Admin) at **Users** &gt; **Active users** &gt; **User** &gt; **Edit mailbox permissions** &gt; **Send email from this mailbox**. For more information, see [Enable sending email from another user's mailbox in Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/Enable-sending-email-from-another-user-s-mailbox-in-Office-365-2B828C5F-41AB-4904-97B9-3B63D8129C4E).</blockquote> |

## [User] How would you like to send email dialog box (optional)

When an email is going to be sent, the user will see the **How would you like to send email** dialog box that will list the available options for sending email.

| Field                                                                  | Description |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Use an email app, such as Outlook                                      | Provides the user with a generated email (.eml) file. |
| Use Exchange email server                                              | Uses the Exchange Online server associated with the tenant. The **Exchange** mail provider is currently not supported outside the public cloud, including on-premises environments. |
| Use the system email client | Opens the **Send email** composition dialog box and then sends the resulting email via SMTP. |
| Do not ask again                                                       | If this field is not selected, the next time an email is sent the most recently selected option will be used and the dialog box will not open. |

## [User] Send email dialog box (optional)

The **Send email** dialog box is opened to allow the user to edit the contents of the email that will be sent. Some of the following fields will be pre-populated in this window.

| Field                                                     | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| From                                                      | Populated from the **Email** field on the **Options** page. |
| **To**, **Cc**, **Bcc**, **Subject**, and **Body** | Populated with values specified by the process that initiated the sending of the email. These fields can be edited as needed by the user. |
| Attachments list                                          | May be populated with attachments specified by the process that initiated the sending of the email. This list can be edited as needed by the user. |

When the email is ready to be sent, the **Send** button will cause the email to be sent via SMTP.

## Usage scenarios to verify if email is configured correctly

### Send mail via a local mail client

Email workflows that are enabled via the SysEmail framework can generate email messages (.eml files) that contain attachments. You can then send these messages via Microsoft Outlook or another email client.

1. In Internet Explorer, navigate to **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Customers** &gt; **All customers**.
2. Select **US-008 Sparrow Retail**.
3. Click **Collect** &gt; **Customer balances** &gt; **Collections** to open the **Collections** page.
4. Click **Communicate** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Statements to contact**.
5. Click **OK** to accept the default values in the dialog box.
6. If you're prompted for the mail option to use, clear the **Do not ask again** check box (you can change this option from the **User options** page), select **Use an email app, such as Outlook**, and then click **OK**.
7. If you're using Internet Explorer on your computer, open the email (.eml) file that is generated. If you're using Internet Explorer on the VM, copy the file to your computer, and open it there.
8. Note the email address in the **To** field and the generated workbook attachment.

### Send mail via SMTP

Email workflows that are enabled via the SysEmail framework can also be created in a simple email dialog box and then sent via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

1. Go to the **Email parameters** page.
2. Click **SMTP settings**.
3. Set the **Outgoing mail server** to the desired SMTP server:

    - For [Microsoft 365 production](https://support.office.com/article/Outlook-settings-for-POP-and-IMAP-access-for-Office-365-for-business-or-Microsoft-Exchange-accounts-7fc677eb-2491-4cbc-8153-8e7113525f6c) (including \*.onmicrosoft.com accounts) use smtp.office365.com. (Find this setting via outlook.office.com, at **Settings** &gt; **Mail** &gt; **POP and IMAP**.)
    - For Outlook/Hotmail use smtp-mail.outlook.com.

4. Set the user name and password to an appropriate email account and password.
5. Leave **SSLRequired** turned on, and leave **SMTP port number** set to **587**.
6. Click **Save**.
7. In Internet Explorer, navigate to **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Customers** &gt; **All customers**.
8. Select **US-008 Sparrow Retail**.
9. Click **Collect** &gt; **Customer balances** &gt; **Collections** to open the **Collections** page.
10. Click **Communicate** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Statements to contact**.
11. Click **OK** to accept the default values in the dialog box.
12. If you're prompted for the mail option to use, select **Use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance email client**, and then click **OK**.
13. To receive the test message, change the **To address** to your email address.

    Ensure that the account specified in the SMTP settings is able to **Send As** and **Send On Behalf Of** your email account. The easiest way to ensure this is to use your email account in the SMTP settings.

14. Enter a subject and body for the message.
15. Click **Send**. The message should be delivered in one to five minutes.

## [Administrator] Workflow email notifications

Workflow email configuration is a collection of related settings that work in conjunction.

### Workflow email notification setup

1. Verify email settings:

    1. Go to **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Email** \> **Email parameters**.
    2. Verify that SMTP is enabled.
    3. Set the SMTP mail server settings.

2. Verify that the email batch process is running:

    1. Go to **System administration** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Email processing** \> **Email distributor batch**.
    2. Enable the **Batch processing** option.
    3. Optionally, adjust the recurrence of the email process:

        1. Select **No end date** to adjust all recurrences of the email batch process.
        2. Adjust the count.
        3. Adjust to run every minute if needed.

3. Verify workflow notification system email templates:

    1. Go to **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Email** \> **System email templates** (for system-wide templates).
    2. Verify that the **Sender email** field is set and valid.

4. Verify workflow notification organization email templates:

    1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Organization email templates** (for organization-specific templates).
    2. Verify that the **Sender email** field is set and valid.

5. Verify that the user can receive email notifications:

    1. Go to **Settings** \> **User options**.
    2. Go to the **Account** tab.

       1. Set the **Email provider ID** (for example, SMTP).
       2. Optionally, set a **Sender email** override if the default **send from** address should not be used for the current user.

    3. Navigate to the **Workflow** tab. Set the option to send notifications in email to **Yes**.

6. Verify that the workflow system will send email notifications:

    For each workflow that should have a notification, open the workflow properties in the workflow editor.

    1. Click **Basic settings**. Adjust the email template for the workflow notifications.
    2. Click **Notifications**.

        1. Enable the events for which a user should be notified.
        2. Set the recipient of the workflow notification for each event notification that is enabled.

    3. On a workflow approval element for which a user should be notified:

        1. Go to **Properties**.
        2. Enable the events for which a user should be notified.
        3. Set the recipient of the workflow notification for each event notification that is enabled.

### Workflow email notification testing

The testing for email notifications is to simply trigger the notification and then check for it.

1. Submit a workflow that has been set up for email notifications.
2. Check the workflow history to make sure that a workflow work item was assigned to the expected user.
3. Check the status of the pending email notification in **System administration** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Email processing** \> **Batch email sending status**.

    If the email fails to be sent, make sure that the SMTP mail account can be opened.

4. Check for the email notification in the appropriate inbox.

## Exchange mail provider

The **Email parameters** page allows an administrator to select **Exchange** as an interactive email provider and as the Batch email provider. The **Exchange** mail provider will use the current user's Exchange Online account to send emails. When used as the Batch email provider, the batch account will be used. No additional configuration is needed. 
If troubleshooting is needed, ensure that it's possible to sign in to the current user's account and that emails can be sent from that account to the intended recipients.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Exchange mail provider is: 
> -  Not supported for external users, as those users will not have Exchange accounts on the system tenant.
> -  Only available in Microsoft-managed environments.

### Specific SMTP email issues 

If you continue to experience issues when email is sent via SMTP, you may be running into one of the specific errors below. If not, consider entering the SMTP account information in a tool such as [SMTPer.net](https://www.smtper.net/) to verify that the SMTP server and account are valid and working correctly.

-  **<span id="single-label-domain-not-accepted-error">SMTP emails fail to be sent with "Recipient addresses in single label domains not accepted"</span>**

This migration causes a change in the way that SMTP user names and passwords are handled in situations where the mail server didn't support authentication. Previously, if an SMTP user name was provided, but the server didn't support authentication, the .NET SMTP mail client ignored the provided user name and password, and continued without authentication. This behavior led some customers to incorrectly believe that they were using an authenticated mail server. In MailKit, authentication is required if a user name is provided. This requirement will trigger an error for mail servers that don't support authentication, and emails will fail to be sent.</td>

## Frequently asked questions

### Where do workflow email templates come from?

The email templates will be sourced from either system email templates or organization email templates depending on whether the workflow is a system-level (not company specific) or organization-level (company specific) workflow.

### What email limits apply when using Exchange or SMTP?  

The system communicates with Exchange or an SMTP server like a typical email client, so standard behavior and limits apply. For example, standard [Exchange Online receiving and sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits) apply.
