To configure a parallel branch, complete the following procedures in the workflow editor.

A parallel branch is essentially a workflow that runs in the context of a parent workflow.

## Name a branch

Follow these steps to enter a name for a parallel branch.

1. Right-click the parallel branch, and then click **Properties**. The **Properties** form is displayed.
2. In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the parallel branch.
4. Click **Close**.

## Design and configure the elements of a branch

Follow these steps to design and configure the elements of a parallel branch.

1. Double-click the parallel branch.
2. Drag workflow elements onto the canvas, and then configure the elements, just as you would to create any other workflow. For more information, see [Create workflows overview](create-workflow.md).
