# Associate a workflow document class with a workflow type

To create a workflow, you must bind a workflow document class to the workflow type. The workflow document class contains references to the table data fields that the workflow uses. This article describes how to bind a workflow document class to a workflow type.

> [!NOTE]
> If you used the **Workflow** wizard to create the workflow type, the wizard has already bound the workflow document class to the workflow type.

Before you begin the following procedure, you must create a workflow document class to expose the table fields that are used for conditions in the configuration user interface (UI). For more information, see [Create a workflow document class](workflow-type-document-create.md).

## Bind a workflow document class to a workflow type

1. In Application Explorer, expand the **Workflow** node.
2. In the **Workflow Types** node, right-click the workflow type that you want to bind a workflow document class to, and then select **Properties**.
3. On the **Properties** sheet, set the **Document** property to the workflow document class that defines the workflow document.
