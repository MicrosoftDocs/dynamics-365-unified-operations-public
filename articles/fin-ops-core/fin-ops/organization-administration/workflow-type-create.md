# Create a workflow type

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

To add workflow support for a document, you must create a workflow type. After you create a workflow type, it can be used to create workflow configurations for the document. This topic provides links to the procedures for creating a workflow type.

You create workflow types to define the following elements:

- The workflow document to assign the workflow to
- A category that defines the module that the workflow type is available in
- Tasks, automated tasks, and approvals that are supported for the workflow
- The workflow started, completed, configuration data change, and canceled event handlers
- A **SubmitToWorkflowMenuItem** menu item

## In this section
