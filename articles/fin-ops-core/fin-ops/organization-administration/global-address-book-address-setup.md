# Address setup

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Global regions where your organization operates might have different address format types. You must be able to adjust to the appropriate address format when a postal address is shown for each region. You can use the **Address setup** page to set up the postal address formats that are required for your organization.

## Define address parameters

The **Parameters** tab of the **Address setup** page defines which fields must be validated when addresses are created. You can select options to require validation for **ZIP/postal code**, **District**, and **City** values.

If the option that corresponds to a field isn't selected, no validation is done for that field when new addresses are created in the global address book. In this case, the field is a free-text field where users can enter any value. If the option that corresponds to a field is selected, validation is done for that field when new addresses are created in the global address book. In this case, the value that is entered in the field must have been previously created in the address setup.

For example, the **City** option is selected in the **Validate on creating addresses** section. In this case, when a new address is created in the global address book, the **City** value for the new address must be selected in the list of cities that is set up in the **City** section of the **Address setup** page.

## Set up address formats

You can set up address component information and formatting on the **Address format** tab. As you enter address information for a selected address type, the **Preview** field in the upper-right pane shows how the address will appear.

1. On the **Address setup** page, on the **Address format** tab, select **New** to add a new address format type.
2. Enter the name of the address format type and a brief description. For example, you might enter **NO** in the **Address format** field and **Norway** in the **Description** field.
3. In the lower pane, select **New** to configure a new address component for the address format type that is selected in the upper pane.
4. In the **Address application object** field, select the first object that must appear when an address in this format is shown. For example, select **Street**.
5. In the **Separator** field, enter the character that is used to separate this object from the next object when an address in this format is shown. For example, enter a comma (**,**).
6. Set the following checkboxes as appropriate:

    - **New line** – Select this checkbox if the object should appear on a new line.
    - **Data entry only** – Select this checkbox if the object should be shown only when the address is entered. If this checkbox is selected, the object won't be shown when the address is printed.
    - **Not active** – Select this checkbox if the object should not be used in an address of the selected format type.
    - **Expand** – Select this checkbox to show the full name of the country/region, state/province, or county instead of the code when the address is printed.
    - **Special** – Select this checkbox if the field value contains the character that you specified as a separator.

## Set up country/region information

Use the **Country/region** tab to define the country/region information for the address setup.

1. On the **Address setup** page, on the **Country/region** tab, select **New** to create a new line.

5. Enter the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) code for the country/region.
6. In the **BACEN code**, **IOR facility ID**, and **Code by OKSM** fields, enter values if they are required for your financial, purchasing, or sales transactions. Also select whether the country/region is a member of the customs union.
7. To enable only valid five-digit or nine-digit ZIP/postal codes, select the **Use ZIP + 4 postal code validation rules** option.

## Set up state/province information

Use the **State/province** tab to define the state/province information for the address setup.
