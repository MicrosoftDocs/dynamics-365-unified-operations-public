# Globalization resources

## Local and regional deployments
If your government regulations require data to be stored differently or serviced differently than is required for other countries/regions, there might be country/region requirements you must consider during deployment. Consider the following resources that might be relevant to you:

[Finance and operations apps operated by 21Vianet in China](../deployment/china-local-deployment.md)

## Localization and regulatory features

[!include [banner](../../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

Finance and operations apps include functionality for the country/regions documented in the [Product localization and translation availability guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck). This functionality is enabled based on the primary address of the active legal entity. 

This article includes lists of resources that can help you do the following: 
- Learn more about developing country/region-specific solutions.
- Get country/region specific updates.
- Submit and review regulatory alerts.
- Learn how to use country/region specific functionality.

### Task guides
Task guides are available from the product help pane and they provide a guided walk-through of key business processes. You can open a task guide to read the steps of a business process or you can play a task guide to walk through a business process and enter data.

To find task guides, navigate to a page in in the application and click Help. Task guides that use the page are listed in the help pane. You can also use the help pane to search for task guides by title.
