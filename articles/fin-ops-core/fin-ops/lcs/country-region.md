# Globalization resources

## Local and regional deployments
If your government regulations require data to be stored differently or serviced differently than is required for other countries/regions, there might be country/region requirements you must consider during deployment. Consider the following resources that might be relevant to you:

[Finance and operations apps operated by 21Vianet in China](../deployment/china-local-deployment.md)

## Localization and regulatory features

[!include [banner](../../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

Finance and operations apps include functionality for the country/regions documented in the [Product localization and translation availability guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck). This functionality is enabled based on the primary address of the active legal entity. 

This article includes lists of resources that can help you do the following: 
- Learn more about developing country/region-specific solutions.
- Get country/region specific updates.
- Submit and review regulatory alerts.
- Learn how to use country/region specific functionality.
