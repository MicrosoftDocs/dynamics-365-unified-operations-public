Sometimes, open positions can be filled by candidates who are already employees in your organization. This procedure walks through the steps of hiring an existing employee through the recruiting process. In this procedure, a recruitment project has already been set up, and an existing employee has already submitted an application for the recruitment project. The **USMF** demo data company was used to create this procedure.

1. Go to **Human resources \> Recruitment \> Applications \> Applications**.
2. In the list, find the application for the employee that you want to hire. For example, select **00002 John Emory**.
3. Select **Application status**.

    The application status indicates where an application is in the recruitment process. Each step is optional. Typically, an application moves through the statuses in the following order: **Received**, **Confirmed**, and **Interviewed**. After the interview process, a hiring decision will be made.

4. Select **Change position**.
5. Select the position that you're hiring the employee for.
6. In the **New assignment start date** field, enter the date when the employee will start to work in the new position.
7. In the **Assignment end date** field, enter the date when the employee will stop working in their current position.

    The start date of the new position and the end date of the old position can overlap. This overlap can occur when a person is performing duties for both positions during a transition period.

8. Optional: Select a reason code. For example, select **Reorganization**.
9. Select **Change position**.

    At this time, you can also change compensation. If you don't, you can change it later by selecting **Fixed Plan** on the **Compensation** tab of the **Worker** page.

    After you select **Change position**, the status on the application is updated to **Employed**.
