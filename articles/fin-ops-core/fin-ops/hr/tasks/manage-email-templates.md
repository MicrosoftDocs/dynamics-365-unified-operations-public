# Manage email templates

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

You can transfer information from your organization's database to the bookmarks in a new document and use it in templates that help you communicate efficiently with applicants and candidates. To do this, you create a template that contains standard text and some bookmarks where the system data should be inserted. For example, you can insert address and contact information for an applicant into a Microsoft Word document that you can use when communicating with that applicant. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.


## Select which bookmarks to use in your email templates

3. Select **Edit**.
4. Select the fields you would like to be able to use in an email template for the selected Correspondence action and move them to the Bookmark fields.
