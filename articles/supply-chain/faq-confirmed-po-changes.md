## What is the Confirmed purchase orders with changes workspace?

The **Confirmed purchase orders with changes** workspace helps procurement professional quickly and easily assess, manage, and follow up on changes that are made to purchase orders after they're confirmed.

This feature is part of the *Procurement with Copilot* feature set, which is a growing collection of features that use AI to help procurement managers with their daily procurement tasks.

## What are capabilities of the Confirmed purchase orders with changes workspace?

The feature takes changes to confirmed purchase orders as input and then identifies the downstream orders that are related to those purchase orders. The feature uses Copilot to generate natural-language summaries and draft communications for vendors. Copilot uses the *Text-davinci-003* generative AI model to generate the natural-language content.

## What is the intended use of the Confirmed purchase orders with changes workspace?

The **Confirmed purchase orders with changes** workspace is intended to help procurement professional review changes to confirmed purchase orders and mitigate the downstream impacts. It supports a workflow where the purchaser first reviews and reconfirms changed purchase orders that have little or no downstream impact.
