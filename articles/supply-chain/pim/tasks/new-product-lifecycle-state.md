This procedure shows how to create a new product lifecycle state. A product lifecycle state documents the lifecycle state of a released product or product variant. Product lifecycle states are defined by the user, typically a product manager, or a product master data manager. Specific business processes, for example, Master planning, can be affected by a specific lifecycle state.


## Create a product lifecycle state
1. Go to Product information management > Setup > Product lifecycle state.
2. Click New.
3. In the State field, type a value.
4. In the Description field, type a value.
