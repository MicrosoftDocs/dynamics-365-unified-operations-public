## Create a unit of measure
1. Click New.
2. In the Unit field, type a value.
    * Enter the ID or symbol to use when referring to the unit of measure.  
3. In the Description field, type a value.
    * Enter a descriptive name for the unit of measure in the system language.  
4. In the Unit class field, select an option.
    * The unit class defines what logical grouping, such as area, mass, or quantity, the unit of measure is part of.  
5. In the Decimal precision field, enter a number.
    * Specify the number of decimals that the converted unit of measure must be rounded to when a calculation is completed for the unit of measure.  
6. Click Save.

## Define unit translations
1. Click Unit texts.
2. Click New.
    * Use unit text to create a translation of the ID or a symbol representing the unit of measure for use on external documents in customer- or vendor-specific languages.  
3. In the Language field, enter or select a value.
4. In the Text field, type a value.
5. Click Save.

5. In the Rounding field, select an option.
    * Define how the converted value should be rounded.  
6. Click OK.
