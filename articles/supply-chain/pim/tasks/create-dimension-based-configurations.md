# Create dimension-based configurations

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This procedure shows how to define a configuration for a dimension-based product.

This is the eighth procedure [of an eight-procedure sequence](../dimension-based-product-configuration.md#sequence) that explains how to build combinations for dimension-based configuration. You should do all eight procedures, in order, because each new procedure builds on data created by the previous procedures. To work through this sequence by using the sample records and values that are specified here, you must be on a system where the standard [demo data](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/demo-data.md) is installed, and you must select the *USMF* legal entity before you begin.

## Find the dimension-based product master

1. Go to **Product information management \> Products \> Released products**.
1. In the list, mark the selected row.
    * Select the dimension-based product master that you created in the [first procedure](create-dimension-based-product-master.md) in this sequence of eight.  

## Create configurations

1. On the **Engineering** Action Pane, select **Maintain configurations**.
1. Select **Configure**.
1. In the list, mark the selected row.
1. In the **Item number** field, enter or select a value.
    * Select any of the items in the first configuration group.  
1. In the list, find and select the desired record.
1. In the **Item number** field, enter or select a value.
    * Select any item from the second configuration group.  
1. Select **OK**.
1. In the list, mark the selected row.
1. In the **Configuration** field, type a value.
    * Enter a configuration name that will make it easy to identify the configuration.  
1. In the **Description** field, type a value.
    * Enter a description of the configuration to explain what it contains.  
1. Select **OK**.
