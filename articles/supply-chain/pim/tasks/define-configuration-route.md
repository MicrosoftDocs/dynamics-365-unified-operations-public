# Define configuration route

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This procedure focuses on defining a configuration route that determines the sequence in which the configuration groups will be presented.

This is the sixth procedure [of an eight-procedure sequence](../dimension-based-product-configuration.md#sequence) that explains how to build combinations for dimension-based configuration. You should do all eight procedures, in order, because each new procedure builds on data created by the previous procedures. To work through this sequence by using the sample records and values that are specified here, you must be on a system where the standard [demo data](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/demo-data.md) is installed, and you must select the *USMF* legal entity before you begin.

1. Go to **Product information management \> Bills of materials and formulas \> Bills of materials**.
2. In the list, find and select the desired record.
3. On the Action Pane, select **Options**.
4. Select **Change view**.
5. Select **Header view**.
6. Expand or collapse the **Configuration route** section.
7. Select **Add**.
8. In the list, mark the selected row.
9. In the **Configuration group** field, select the drop-down button to open the lookup.
10. In the list, select the link in the selected row.
11. Select **Add**.
12. In the list, mark the selected row.
13. In the **Configuration group** field, select the drop-down button to open the lookup.
14. In the list, find and select the desired record.
15. In the list, select the link in the selected row.
