# Product information management FAQ

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the product information management functionality of Supply Chain Management.

## Can I change the item number of a released product?

In most cases, you can't edit item numbers for released products, because that change will cause data to become corrupted. You can edit the item number only if you must repair data corruption that was caused by a previous rename of the primary key of that released product, as mentioned in the list of [removed or deprecated features for Finance and Operations 10.0.0 with Platform update 24](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md#finance-and-operations-1000-with-platform-update-24).

If you want to be able to edit item numbers for released products, [vote for this idea in Ideas portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=660fcb15-875d-ea11-b698-0003ff68bc25).
