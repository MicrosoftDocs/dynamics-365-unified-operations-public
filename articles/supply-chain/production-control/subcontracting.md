# Subcontracting

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic will help you build a walkthrough of subcontracting in manufacturing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. The first part of this topic describes the setup of the data. The second part takes you through the steps in the walkthrough.

## Target audience

In this topic, you will learn how to set up subcontracting in manufacturing. You will use existing data in the HQUS legal entity to do the basic setup of a subcontracting activity flow. The demo data in the HQUS legal entity includes setup parameters that have been preset to support the steps in the walkthrough. Even though the walkthrough addresses key pain points and challenges for various roles, it can be completed by the system admin.

## Demo scenario

In the HQUS legal entity, high-end speakers are manufactured. During the manufacturing process, speakers go through the following three operations.

- **Pre-assembly** – The speaker cabinet is assembled. The material for the cabinet is picked in the material warehouse before the operation is started.
- **Coating** – After the speaker cabinet has been assembled, it must be coated. This operation is completed by a vendor (subcontractor). The pre-assembled speaker cabinet is shipped to the coating subcontractor together with two materials.
- **Finish** – After the pre-assembled speaker cabinet has been coated by the subcontractor, it's returned to the HQUS legal entity so that final assembly of the speaker can be completed.

The following illustration shows the three operations and the materials that they consume.

## Setup

Before you start the walkthrough, you must set up the data.

### Set up the finished product

This procedure takes you through the setup of released product D8100, "Coated Cabinet."

1. Select **Product information management \> Products \> Released products** to open the **Released product details** page.
2. In the quick filter field, enter **D8100** to find the existing released product.

    ![Filtering for released product D8100 on the Released product details page](./media/subcontract02_filtering-released-products.png)

3. On the Action Pane, on the **Engineer** tab, select **Route** to open the **Route** page.

    The **Route** page shows the eight route versions for released product D8100. The eight route versions are divided among four routes on site 1 and site 5. Route 000400 is used for costing, route 00041 is used when the Coating operation is an internal operation, and route 00042 is used when the Coating operation is an external operation.

    ![Eight route versions on the Route page](./media/subcontract03_route-page.png)

4. In the upper pane, in the **Versions** grid, select route version **00042** for site **5**.
5. In the lower pane, on the **Overview** tab, select operation **20** (**Cbnt CtSc**) in the grid.

    ![Operation 20 for route version 00042 for site 5 selected](./media/subcontract04_route-version-operation.png)

6. Select the **General** tab.

    Notice that the field **Route type** field is set to **Vendor**. This value indicates that operation 20 (Cbnt CtSc) is a subcontracted operation.

    ![Route type field set to Vendor on the General tab](./media/subcontract05_general-tab.png)

7. Select the **Resource requirements** tab.

    Capabilities will be used to find an applicable resource during production scheduling. For operation 20 (Cbnt CtSc), notice that a resource that has two capabilities, **Coating** and **Coated cabinets**, is required.

    ![Coating and Coated cabinets capabilities on the resource requirements tab](./media/subcontract06_resource-requirements-tab.png)

8. Select **Applicable resources** to open the **Applicable resources** dialog box.

    Three resources are found that match the resource requirements for the operation. Notice that resources 8851 and 8852 are of the **Vendor** type.

    ![Three appropriate resources in the Applicable resources dialog box](./media/subcontract07_applicable-resources-dialog.png)

9. Select **OK** to close the **Applicable resources** dialog box and return to the **Route** page.
10. Close the **Route** page to return to the **Released product details** page.

    ![Released product details page](./media/subcontract08_released-product-details-page.png)

11. On the Action Pane, on the **Engineer** tab, select **BOM versions** to open the **BOM versions** page.

    The **BOM versions** page shows the four bill of materials (BOM) versions for released product D8100. BOM 000040 is used for costing and planning, BOM 000041 is used if the Coating operation is done in-house, and BOMs 000042 and 000043 are used if the Coating operation is subcontracted.

    Notice that item S8050 is a product of the **Service** item type. This item represents the subcontracted work.

    ![Four BOM versions on the BOM versions page](./media/subcontract09_bom-versions-page.png)

12. On the **Bill of materials lines** FastTab, select **Edit** to open the **Edit BOM line** dialog box.

    When a production order is created and estimated for released product D8100, a purchase order will be automatically generated for item S8050. This purchase order will be linked to the production order. For purchase orders to be automatically generated, the **Line type** field must be set to **Vendor**, and the vendor account for the subcontractor must be selected. In this case, the vendor account is US-801.

    Notice that the BOM line is connected to the Coating operation through the operation number (in this case, 20).

    ![Edit BOM line dialog box](./media/subcontract10_edit-bom-line-dialog.png)

### Create a password for warehouse workers

You must define a password for the warehouse workers who use the hand-held device.

1. Select **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Worker** to open the **Work users** page.
2. On the **Users** FastTab, select the row for user **51**.

    ![Work users page](./media/subcontract11_work-users-page.png)

3. Select **Reset password**.
4. In the **Password** and **Confirm password** fields, enter **1**.
5. Select **Set password**.

## Step-by-step walkthrough

**Scenario and background**

A production order of 10 pieces is created for product D8100, "Coated Cabinet." The coating of the cabinets is a sub-contracted operation that is done at vendor US-801, Perfect Coating Solutions. The production order consists of three operations. In the first operation, the cabinet is pre-assembled as an in-house operation. The material for the pre-assembly is released for picking in the raw material warehouse. After the pre-assembly is completed, the pre-assembled cabinet is sent to Perfect Coating Solutions together with two materials that are required for the Coating operation. When the coated cabinet is received back from the vendor, it goes through a final in-house assembly operation before it's reported as finished.

1. Select **Production control \> Production orders \> All production orders** to open the **All production orders** page.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New production order** to open the **Create production order** dialog box.
