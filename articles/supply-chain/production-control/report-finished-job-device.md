# Report as finished to a license plate controlled location from the Job card device 

The process called Reporting as finished completes finished products on a production order to the inventory. If the finished product is enabled for the advanced warehouse processes, the product is reported as finished to a location called the production output location. For information about setting up the production output location, see [Production output location](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/production-control/production-output-location).

If the production output location is license plate controlled, then a license plate must be provided when reporting as finished. The **License plate** field is visible on the **Report progress** prompt on the **Job card device** page. The field is only visible on the **Report progress** prompt when reporting on the last operation of the production order and the item for the production order is enabled for the warehouse management processes. 

There are two options for providing the license plate
- The user is selecting an existing license plate in the license plate field.
- The license plate is automatically generated from a number sequence and defaulted to the license plate field.

The option to have the license plate generated automatically is configured by selecting the option **Generate license plate** on the **Configure job card for devices** page.
