# Consolidated batch orders

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.

A bulk item that is produced is considered a parent item, whereas a packed item is considered a child item. The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion. This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself.  

Packed items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit. By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.  

A consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:

-   A single bulk order and multiple packed orders
-   Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders
-   Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order
-   Only packed orders
