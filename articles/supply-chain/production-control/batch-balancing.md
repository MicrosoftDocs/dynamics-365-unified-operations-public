# Batch balancing

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how the batch balancing process is supported. 

For more information, watch a [video on batch balancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SNLWsU9KyI&feature=youtu.be).

In the batch balancing process, the amount of ingredients to use in a production
batch is calculated from the concentration of active ingredients in selected
product batches.

Products that have an active ingredient
---------------------------------------

A product can be defined by its concentration of an active ingredient. The
active ingredient of a product is modeled by using a product-specific batch
attribute that has a minimum value, a maximum value, and a target level.

The target level of a batch attribute represents the estimated percentage of an
active ingredient in a product. The minimum and maximum values represent the
accepted deviation from the target level. They can be used, for example, as an
accepted tolerance for batches at product receipt.

A product can have only one active ingredient. To specify the active ingredient
of a product, you must first define a product-specific batch attribute. You then associate the attribute as a base attribute of the product.

On the product level, you must also specify how the level of the active
ingredient for a batch of the product should be recorded: as part of the
purchase receipt process or as part of a quality order process.

To associate a base attribute with a product, the following setup is required:

-   The product must be batch-controlled. To make a product batch-controlled,
    you must assign a tracking dimension group to the product that has an active
    Batch dimension.

-   The attribute that indicates the ingredient levels must be defined as a
    product-specific batch attribute for the product.

You can look up and edit the actual value of the active ingredient for a batch
on the **Inventory batch attributes** page. 

-  Select **Inventory management** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Tracking dimensions** \> **Batches** \>
**Inventory batch attributes**.

Ingredient types and how they interact in the batch balancing process
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A formula line that is created can have one of these ingredient types:

-   None

-   Active

-   Compensating

-   Filler

The rest of this section provides examples that show how each ingredient type
works. The examples are based on the following formula that has a total batch
size of 100 liters.

| **Ingredient type** | **Item number** | **Formula line quantity** | **Unit** |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|----------|
| None                | A               | 20                        | Liter    |
| Active              | B               | 30                        | Liter    |
| Compensating        | C               | 10                        | Liter    |
| Filler              | D               | 40                        | Liter    |

### Active

When a product that has a base attribute is added to a formula line, it's
referred to as an *active ingredient* of the formula. Batch orders that have
formulas that include active ingredients can be used for the batch balancing
process. For each ingredient in the formula, the batch balancing process
estimates the amount that is required to produce the product. The estimate of
amounts is based on the concentration of active ingredients in the selected
batches.

**Example**

Ingredient B has base attribute X and a target level of 30, and it's included in
a formula that requires 30 liters of ingredient B for every 100 liters of the
product. A batch order is created that has a batch size of 100 liters. The batch
order is started, and during the batch balancing process, the user selects a
batch of ingredient B that has a potency level of 35. Because the potency level
of 35 is higher than the target level of 30, the balanced quantity of
ingredient B is reduced by using the ratio of the potency value to the target
level of the batch, which is multiplied by the estimated quantity. The
calculation of the balanced quantity looks like this:

(30 ÷ 35) × 30 liters = 25.71 liters

| **Item number** | **Ingredient type** | **Estimated quantity** | **Balanced quantity** | **Active quantity** | **Unit** | **Base value** |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| A               | None                | 20                     | 20                    |                     | Liter    |                |
| B               | Active              | 30                     | 25.71                 | 9.00                | Liter    | 30.00          |
| C               | Compensating        | 10                     | 14.72                 |                     | Liter    |                |
| D               | Filler              | 40                     | 39.57                 |                     | Liter    |                |

### None

When you apply the batch balancing process when the ingredient type is **None**,
the estimated quantity and the balanced quantity of the formula line in the batch
order are the same.

**Example**

Ingredient A is assigned to an ingredient of the **None** type and added to a
formula for a finished product. The formula requires 10 liters of ingredient A
for every 100 liters of the finished product. When a batch order requires 200
liters, both the estimated quantity and the balanced quantity of ingredient A
are calculated as 20 liters.

### Compensating

A compensating ingredient can either offset or complement the effect of the
active ingredient in a product. Therefore, the quantity of a compensating
ingredient that is consumed depends on the potency of the product:

-   **Opposing effect** – If the amount of the active ingredient is more than
    anticipated, you must add less of the compensating ingredient.

-   **Complementary effect** – If the amount of the active ingredient is less
    than anticipated, you must add more of the compensating ingredient.

The relation between an active ingredient and a complementary ingredient is set
up on the **Compensating principle** page.

Follow these steps to set up relations between ingredients.

1.  Select **Product information management** \> **Bills and materials and
    formulas** \> **Formulas**, open a formula line, and then select
    **Ingredients** to open the **Compensating principle** page.

2.  Select the line that represents a compensating principle, and then select
    the active ingredient to compensate.

>   In the compensating principle, you also enter a positive or negative
>   compensating factor to specify how much to compensate for, and whether the
>   principle should be opposing or complementary. A positive factor indicates a
>   complementary effect, and a negative factor indicates an opposing effect.

**Example**

Ingredient B is an active ingredient that has base attribute X and a target
level of 30. It's included in a formula that requires 30 liters of ingredient B
for every 100 liters of the product. Ingredient C is a compensating ingredient,
and a quantity of 10 is included in the same formula. A compensating factor of
1.10 is set up for the compensating principle. Therefore, the balanced quantity
of the compensating ingredient will be reduced by the difference between the
active ingredient's balanced quantity and the estimated required quantity
multiplied by 1.10.

In the example for the **Active** ingredient type, the balanced quantity of the
required active ingredient was calculated as 25.71, and the estimated required
quantity was calculated as 30. In this case, the balanced quantity of the
compensating ingredient will be calculated like this:

1.  The difference between the estimated and the balanced quantity is
    determined:

>   25.71 – 30 = –4.29

2.  The result is multiplied by the compensating factor:

>   4.29 × 1.10 = –4.72

3.  The estimated compensating quantity is reduced by –4.72 to determine the
    balanced compensating quantity:

>   10 – (–4.72) = 14.72

Because 1.10 is a positive compensating factor, this compensating principle has
a complementary effect. In this case, the active ingredient is more potent than
anticipated. Therefore, more of the compensating ingredient is required.

### Filler

A *filler ingredient* is a neutral ingredient that is used to reach the desired
output quantity of the finished product. Adjustments to filler quantities are
calculated based on variations in the active ingredient and the compensating
ingredient compared to the standard quantity.

**Example**

You've formulated a product that includes ingredients A, B, C, and D for a
formula size of 100 liters. You've calculated the balanced quantity of all the
ingredient types except the **Filler** ingredient type that is used on one line.
The balanced quantity of the filler ingredient is calculated as the difference
between the batch size of 100 liters and the sum of ingredients A, B, and C:

100 – (20 + 25.71 + 14.72) = 39.57

The batch balancing process
---------------------------

The batch balancing process is performed from the **Batch balancing** page.
Select **Cost management** \> **Batch orders**, and then, on the **Process**
tab, select **Batch balancing**. Batch balancing is available for batch orders
that have a status of **Started**.

In general, batch balancing can be applied to batch orders if the formula has at
least one formula line where the ingredient type is **Active**. (For the
exception to this rule, see the "Batch orders that aren't applicable for batch
balancing" section later in this topic.)

The batch balancing process can be divided into two subprocesses:

1.  Balance batch ingredients

2.  Confirm and release the formula

### Balance batch ingredients

In the Balance batch ingredients subprocess, the amount of ingredients to use
for the production batch is calculated based on the selected batches that have
active ingredients. As a rule, the calculation can be completed only if there is
full coverage of all ingredients. You can't balance only part of the batch that
the batch order is set up to produce.

[!NOTE]
You can't save a calculation and then complete the batch balancing process
later. If you close the **Batch balancing** page, you must repeat the
calculation to complete the process.

### Confirm and release the formula

After the ingredient quantities have been calculated, you can confirm and
release the formula. The release process differs, depending on whether the
products are enabled for the warehouse management processes:

-   If a product is enabled for the warehouse management processes, the formula
    line is released to the warehouse according to the principles for the
    warehouse management processes. The formula line is released in quantities
    that match the balanced quantities, and it's released for the specific
    batches that are selected for the active ingredients.

> [!NOTE]
>   Formula lines can be released to warehouse only as part of the batch
>   balancing process. Although there are other options for releasing materials
>   for production to warehouse, those options can't be used for formula lines.

-   If a product isn't enabled for the warehouse management processes, a
    production picking list is created for the product when you confirm and
    release the formula.

In a single formula, you can combine products that are enabled for the warehouse
management processes and products that aren't enabled for the warehouse
management processes. When the two types of products are included in one
formula, the products that are enabled for the warehouse management processes
are released to warehouse. For the products that aren't enabled for the
warehouse management processes, a picking list is created when the formula is
confirmed and released.

### Batch orders that aren't applicable for batch balancing

There is one exception to the rule that batch orders are applicable for batch
balancing if the formula has at least one formula line where the ingredient type
is **Active**.

If a formula contains an active ingredient for a product that is enabled for the
warehouse management processes, but Batch number is below Location in the
reservation hierarchy, the batch order isn't applicable for batch balancing.

A batch order that isn't applicable for batch balancing goes through the regular
process cycle for batch orders.
