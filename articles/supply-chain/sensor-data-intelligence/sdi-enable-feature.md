## Procedure

Before you can use Sensor Data Intelligence, it must be turned on for your system.

1. Go to **System administration \> Workspaces \> Feature management**. (For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).)
1. On the **All** tab, use the **Filter** field to search for the feature that is named *Sensor Data Intelligence*.
1. If the *Sensor Data Intelligence* feature is enabled on your system, select it in the list, and then select **Disable** to disable it. You can't use this older version of the feature together with the new preview version that you will enable in the next step.
1. Use the **Filter** field to search for the feature that is named *(Preview) Sensor Data Intelligence*.
1. Select the feature in the list, and then select **Enable now** to enable it.
