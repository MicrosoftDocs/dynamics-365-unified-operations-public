# Warehouse management workloads for cloud and edge scale units

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include [preview banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

> [!WARNING]
> Not all warehouse management business functionality is fully supported for warehouses running a workload on a scale unit. Be sure to use only the processes that this topic explicitly describes as supported.

## Warehouse execution on scale units

This feature enables scale units to run selected processes from the warehouse management capabilities. Cloud scale units run their workloads in the cloud by using dedicated processing capacity in your selected Microsoft Azure region. For edge scale units, you can run some workloads independently on premises, even while the scale units are temporarily disconnected from the cloud.

In this topic, warehouse management executions in a warehouse that is defined as a scale unit are known as a *Warehouse execution system* (*WES*).

## Prerequisites

You must have a Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management hub and a scale unit that has been deployed with the warehouse management workload. For more information about the architecture and deployment process, see [Cloud and edge scale units for manufacturing and warehouse management workloads](cloud-edge-landing-page.md).

## How the WES workload works on scale units

For the processes in the warehouse management workload, the data is synced between the hub and the scale units.

A scale unit can maintain only the data that it owns. The data ownership concept for scale units helps prevent multi-master conflicts. Therefore, it's important that you understand which processes are owned by the hub and which are owned by the scale units.

The scale units own the following data:

- **Wave processing data** – Selected wave process methods are handled as part of the scale unit wave processing.
- **Work processing data** – The following types of work order processing are supported:

  - **Inventory movements** (manual movement and movement by template work)
  - **Purchase orders** (putaway work via a warehouse order when purchase orders are not associated with loads)
  - **Sales orders** (simple picking and loading work)
  - **Transfer orders** (only outbound with simple picking and loading work)

- **Warehouse order receipt data** – This data is used only for purchase orders that are manually released to a warehouse.
- **License plate data** – License plates can be created on the hub and the scale unit. Dedicated conflict handling has been provided. Note that this data isn't warehouse-specific.

## Outbound process flow

The hub owns the following data:

- All source documents, such as sales orders and transfer orders
- Order allocation and outbound load processing
- The release to warehouse, shipment creation, wave creation, and wave finalization processes

The scale units own the actual wave processing (such as work allocation, replenishment work, and demand work creation) after the release of the wave. Therefore, warehouse workers can process outbound work by using a warehouse app that is connected to the scale unit.

![Wave processing flow](./media/wes-wave-processing-ga.png "Wave processing flow")

## Inbound process flow

The hub owns the following data:

- All source documents, such as purchase orders and sales return orders
- Inbound load processing
- All cost and financial updates

> [!NOTE]
> The inbound purchase order flow is conceptually different from the outbound flow. You can operate the same warehouse on either the scale unit or the hub depending on whether the purchase order has been released to warehouse or not. Once you have released an order to the warehouse, you can only work with that order while signed in on the scale unit.

If you're using the *release to warehouse* process, [*warehouse orders*](cloud-edge-warehouse-order.md) are created, and ownership of the related receiving flow is assigned to the scale unit. The hub won't be able to register inbound receiving.

The worker can run the receiving process by using a warehouse app that is connected to the scale unit. The data is then recorded by the scale unit and reported against the inbound warehouse order. The creation and processing of the subsequent putaway will also be handled by the scale unit.

If you aren't using the *release to warehouse* process, and therefore aren't using *warehouse orders*, the hub can process warehouse receiving and work processing independently from scale units.

## Supported processes and roles

Not all warehouse management processes are supported in a WES workload on a scale unit. Therefore, we recommend that you assign roles that match the functionality that is available to each user.

To facilitate this process, a sample role that is named *Warehouse manager on workload* is included in the demo data at **System administration \> Security \> Security configuration**. The purpose of this role is to enable warehouse managers to access the WES on the scale unit. The role grants access to the pages that are relevant in the context of a workload that is hosted on a scale unit.

User roles on a scale unit are assigned as part of the initial data synchronization from the hub to the scale unit.

To modify the roles that are assigned to a user, go to **System administration \> Security \> Assign users to roles**. Users who act as warehouse managers only on scale units should be assigned only the *Warehouse manager on workload* role. This approach will ensure that those users have access only to the supported functionality. Remove any other roles that are assigned to those users.

Users who act as warehouse managers on both the hub and scale units should be assigned the existing *Warehouse worker* role. Be aware that this role grants warehouse workers access to features (such as transfer order receiving processing) that appear in the user interface (UI) but aren't currently supported on scale units.

## Supported WES processes

The following warehouse execution processes can be enabled for a WES workload on a scale unit:

- Selected wave methods for sales and transfer orders (allocation, demand replenishment, containerization, work creation, and wave label printing)
- Processing sales and transfer order warehouse work using the warehouse app (including replenishment work)
- Querying on-hand inventory by using the warehouse app
- Creating and running inventory movements by using the warehouse app
- Registering purchase orders and doing putaway work by using the warehouse app

The following work order types are currently supported for WES workloads on scale unit deployments:

- Sales orders
- Transfer issue
- Replenishment
- Inventory movement
- Purchase orders (linked to warehouse orders)

No other types source-documents processing or warehouse work are currently supported on scale units. For example, for a WES workload on a scale unit, you can't perform a transfer order receiving process (transfer receipt) or process cycle counting work.

> [!NOTE]
> Mobile device menu items and buttons for unsupported functionalities aren't shown in the _warehouse app_ when it is connected to a scale unit deployment.

> [!WARNING]
> When you run a workload on a scale unit, you can't run unsupported processes for that specific warehouse on the hub. The tables provided later in this topic document the supported capabilities.
>
> Selected warehouse work types can be created both on the hub and on scale units, but can only be maintained by the owning hub or scale unit (the deployment which created the data).
>
> Even when a specific process is scale unit supported, be aware that all the needed data might not get synchronized from the hub to the scale unit, or from the scale unit to the hub, which risks resulting in unexpected system processing. Examples being:
> 
> - If you use a location directive query that joins a data table record that only exists at the hub deployment.
> - If you use location status and/or location volumetric load functionalities. This data will not get synchronized between the deployments and will therefore only work when updating location inventory on-hand on one of the deployments.

The following warehouse management functionality isn't currently supported for scale unit workloads:

- Inbound processing of purchase order lines assigned to a load
- Inbound processing of purchase orders for a project
- Inbound and outbound processing for items that have active tracking dimensions **Owner** and/or **Serial number**
- Processing of inventory that has a blocking status value
- Changing of an inventory status during any work movement process
- Order-committed flexible warehouse-level dimension reservations
- Use of *Warehouse location status* functionality (the data isn't synced between the deployments)
- Use of *Location license plate positioning* functionality
- Use of *Product filters* and *Product filter groups*, including the **Number of days to mix batches** setting
- Integration with quality management
- Processing with catch-weight items
- Processing with items only enabled for Transportation management (TMS)
- Processing with negative on-hand inventory
- Warehouse work processing with custom work types
- Warehouse work processing with shipment notes
- Warehouse work processing with cycle counting threshold triggering
- Warehouse work processing with material handling/warehouse automation
- Use of product master data image (for example, on the warehouse app)

> [!WARNING]
> Some warehouse functionality won't be available for warehouses running the warehouse management workloads on a scale unit, and also isn't supported on the hub or on the scale unit workload.
> 
> Other capabilities can get processed on both, but will require careful use in some scenarios, such as when inventory on-hand gets updated for the same warehouse on both the hub and scale unit due to the asynchronous data update process.
> 
> Specific functionalities (such as *block work*) which are supported on both the hub and scale units will only be supported for the owner of the data.

### Production

Warehouse management production scenarios aren't currently supported on scale unit workloads, as indicated in the following table.

| Process | Hub | WES workload on a scale unit |
|---------|-----|------------------------------|
| <p>All warehouse management processes that are related to production. Here are some examples:</p><li>Release to warehouse</li><li>Production wave processing</li><li>Raw material picking</li><li>RAF and finished goods put away</li><li>Co-product and by-product put away</li><li>Kanban put away</li><li>Kanban picking</li><li>Start production order</li><li>Production scrap</li><li>Production last pallet</li><li>Register material consumption</li><li>Empty kanban</li></ul> | Yes | No |

## Maintaining scale units for WES

Several batch jobs run on both the hub and scale units.

On the hub deployment, you can manually maintain the batch jobs. You can manage the following batch jobs at **Warehouse management \> Periodic tasks \> Back-office workload management**:

- Process work status update events
- Scale unit to hub message processor
- Register source order receipts
- Complete warehouse orders
- Process quantity update responses for warehouse order lines

On the workload in scale units, you can manage the following batch jobs at **Warehouse management \> Periodic tasks \> Workload management**:

- Process wave table records
- Warehouse hub to scale unit message processor
- Process quantity update requests for warehouse order lines
