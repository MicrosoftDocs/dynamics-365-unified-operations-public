# Warehouse inventory adjustment

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Warehouse inventory adjustment feature is used when running cloud and edge scale units for [manufacturing workloads](cloud-edge-workload-manufacturing.md) and [warehouse management workloads](cloud-edge-workload-warehousing.md).

When a worker does an inventory adjustment using the warehouse app against a scale unit warehouse management workload, the physical on-hand update must be processed by the **Warehouse inventory adjustment journal** batch job, which you run and schedule by going to **Warehouse management > Periodic tasks > Warehouse inventory adjustment journal**.

The following warehouse app work processes currently use the **Warehouse inventory adjustment journal** on scale unit workloads:

- Adjustment in/out
- Cycle counting
- License plate loading

Several inventory transactions are created as part of each inventory adjustment process because the hub and scale unit deployments share the inventory records.

## Inventory adjustment example

In this example, a warehouse worker has used the warehouse app to register the adding of on-hand inventory.

First, the scale unit workload creates a warehouse inventory adjustment transaction for the positive physical adjustment, which is then synchronized to the hub and results in an increase of the on-hand inventory on the hub.

| Type                                    | Scale unit | Direction | Hub |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|-----------|-----|
| Warehouse inventory adjustment          | +1         | ->        | +1  |

The hub then processes a counting journal posting, which is received through [message processor messages](cloud-edge-message-processor-messages.md). This updates the additional inventory on hand. To prevent double inventory on hand, the hub creates an offset transaction as part of this process and removes the previously recorded on-hand inventory that is related to the warehouse inventory adjustment.

| Type                                    | Scale unit | Direction | Hub |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|-----------|-----|
| Counting                                | +1         | <-        | +1  |
| Warehouse inventory adjustment (Offset) | -1         | <-        | -1  |

After a scale unit has created a **Warehouse inventory adjustment journal** on the hub, you can review both the **Counting journal** and the **Offset journal**, which are created by the hub as part of the adjustment process.

You can review each of these journal entries and transaction in Supply Chain Management by doing the following steps:

1. Sign in on the scale unit.
1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Periodic tasks \> Warehouse inventory adjustment journal**.
1. On the **Warehouse inventory adjustment journal** page, find and open the journal that recorded the on-hand inventory change. The **Journal lines** section shows each adjustment recorded by this journal.
1. Sign in on the hub.
1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Periodic tasks \> Warehouse inventory adjustment journal**.
1. On the **Warehouse inventory adjustment journal** page, you should see the same journal listed if the hub and scale unit have synced.
1. Open the journal. If the [message processor messages](cloud-edge-message-processor-messages.md) have been processed, you will see links to the **Counting journal** and the **Offset journal** in the header.
    - The **Counting journal** should show the same dimension values as the journal lines.
    - The **Offset journal** should show the offset, which removes the double inventory adjustment.
    > [!NOTE]
    > When all syncing and processing is complete, the **Counting journal** and the **Offset journal** are synced back to the scale unit. These can also be viewed from the relevant **Warehouse inventory adjustment journal** page.
