# Scale unit capability for Supply Chain Management is deprecated and no longer available to new customers

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The scale unit capability for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management has been paused for new customers since July 2022 and is now deprecated. [Warehouse management only mode](../warehousing/wms-only-mode-overview.md) replaces some of the functionality planned for scale units and adds many new architectural and integration possibilities. For more information about this and other feature deprecations, see [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](../get-started/removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md).
>
> The Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) Core platform for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce isn't related to the scale unit capability for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management in any way. CSU Core is not affected by this announcement and is still fully supported for the Dynamics 365 Commerce application. For more information about that functionality, see [Introduction to Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) Core](../../commerce/dev-itpro/CSU-core.md).
