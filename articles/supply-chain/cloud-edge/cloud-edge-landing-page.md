> The scale unit capability for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is paused for new customers as the architecture is undergoing enhancements. We are not taking on any new customers for this solution currently, but are actively working on a composable, flexible, and easy-to-use architecture for our Supply Chain line of business that will further enhance our ability to provide a world-class scale unit solution for our customers.
>
> We are working to enhance Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to allow for further composability across specific modules like Warehouse management. We will continue to plan for and develop new cloud and edge scale unit offerings to meet our customers' needs.
>
> The Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) Core platform for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce isn't related to the scale unit capability for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management in any way. CSU Core is not affected by this announcement and is still fully supported for the Dynamics 365 Commerce application. For more information about that functionality, see [Introduction to Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) Core](../../commerce/dev-itpro/CSU-core.md).
