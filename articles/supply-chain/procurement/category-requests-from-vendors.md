# Category requests from vendors

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The category request process lets vendors request that new procurement categories be associated with their account. Those procurement categories can then be used by the related procurement and sourcing processes. (For more information, see [Procurement catalogs overview](procurement-catalogs.md).)

Category requests are initiated by vendors in the **Vendor information** workspace. They are then submitted to your agency for review and approval. Approved categories are added to the list of procurement categories for the vendor's account.

## Turn the category requests from vendors feature on or off

As of Supply Chain Management version 10.0.25, this feature is turned on by default. Admins can turn this functionality on or off by searching for the *Allow vendors to apply for procurement categories through vendor collaboration* feature in the [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace.

If this feature is turned on, you can still manually add procurement categories to vendor accounts. For information, see [Approve vendors for specific procurement categories](tasks/approve-vendors-specific-procurement-categories.md).

## Vendor collaboration requirements

Before a vendor can interact with category requests, it must be set up for vendor collaboration.

The vendor must have at least one vendor collaboration user. Only vendor users with the *Vendor admin (external)* security role can create and submit category requests.

For more information, see [Set up and maintain vendor collaboration](set-up-maintain-vendor-collaboration.md).

## Set up the Vendor category request workflow

The *Vendor category request* workflow must be set up in the procurement and sourcing workflows. Vendors will submit new category requests that you can review and approve. Requested procurement categories are added to a vendor account after a category request is approved.

The following example shows how to set up a simple *Vendor category request* workflow that has a single approver. You must review your internal processes to determine the appropriate workflow setup for your agency.

1. Go to **Procurement and sourcing \> Setup \> Procurement and sourcing workflows**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
1. In the dialog box, select **Vendor category request workflow** to open the workflow editor.
1. Sign in to the workflow editor.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Properties**.
1. On the **Properties** page for the workflow, in the **Submission instructions** field, enter instruction text. The instructions will be visible to vendors when they submit a category request.
1. Close the **Properties** page.
1. Drag the **Approve new category request** workflow element onto the canvas.
1. Drag a link from the **Start** workflow element to the **Approve new category request** workflow element.
1. Drag a link from the **Approve new category request** workflow element to the **End** workflow element.
1. Double-tap (or double-click) the **Approve new category request** workflow element.
1. Select and hold (or right-click) the **Step 1** workflow element, and then select **Properties**.
1. On the **Properties** page for the workflow element, in the **Work item subject** field, enter subject text. This text will be shown as the value of the **Subject** field on the **Work items assigned to me** page.
1. In the **Work item instructions** field, enter instruction text. The instructions will be visible to approvers when they select **Workflow** on the Action Pane of a category request.
1. In the left pane, select **Assignment**.
1. On the **Assignment type** tab, set **Assign users to this workflow element** to *User*.
1. On the **User** tab, in the **Available users** list, select an approver. For example, select a user in the Procurement department.
1. Select the right arrow button (**\>**) to move the approver to the **Selected users** list.
1. Close the **Properties** page.
1. Select **Save and close**.
1. In the **Version notes** field, enter notes about the workflow.
1. Select **OK** to save the workflow.
1. If you're ready to start to test the workflow, select **Activate the new version**. Otherwise, select **Do not activate the new version**.
1. Select **OK** to complete the workflow setup.

> [!TIP]
> If your agency doesn't require approval of category requests, you should configure the workflow for automatic approval.

For more information about how to set up workflows, see [Workflow system overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/overview-workflow-system.md).
