# Procurement and sourcing workflows

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


Some organizations require that purchase requisitions and purchase orders are approved by a user other than the person who entered the transaction. To set up an approval process, you can create a workflow.

A workflow represents a business process. It defines how a document flows through the system and indicates who must complete a task or approve a document. There are several benefits of using the workflow system in your organization:
-   **Consistent processes**— You can define the approval process for specific documents, such as purchase requisitions and expense reports. Using the workflow system helps to ensure that documents are processed and approved in a consistent and efficient manner.
-   **Process visibility**— You can track the status, history, and performance metrics of a specific workflow instance. This helps you determine whether changes should be made to the workflow to improve efficiency.
-   **Centralized work list**— Users can view a centralized work list to view the workflow tasks and approvals assigned to them across all workflows they participate in. This is available in the Work items page.

## The types of workflows that you can create
The following workflow types are available for Procurement and sourcing.

|                                  |                                                               |

## Creating a workflow

In the workflow canvas you can drag workflow elements into the designer and link the elements into a flow. The workflow elements should be configured. For approval and task workflow elements you can configure which participant should take action.
 Types of participants
