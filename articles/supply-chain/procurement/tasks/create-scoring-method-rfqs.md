# Create a scoring method for RFQs

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure shows you how to create a scoring method. A scoring method is a set of criteria that can be used to compare bids that are sent in reply to a request for quotation (RFQ). For example, you might want to rate a vendor on past performance, or rate whether the company is environmentally friendly or a good collaborator, or you might want to compare bids based on price. The scoring method can be associated with a solicitation type as the default scoring method for RFQs of that type. These tasks would typically be carried out by a purchasing manager. You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF or on your own data.
