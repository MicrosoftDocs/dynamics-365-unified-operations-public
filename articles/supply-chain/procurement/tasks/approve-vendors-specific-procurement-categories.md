[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to approve vendors for specific procurement categories in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. When a purchase requisition is created, there may be a requirement to select an approved or preferred vendor, depending on how the purchasing policies are set up. This procedure shows you how to specify that a vendor is approved or preferred for a specific procurement category. This task would usually be carried out by a procurement professional. You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules > Procurement and sourcing > Vendors > All vendors**.
2. Select the vendor that you want to set as an approved or preferred vendor for a category.
3. On the Action Pane, select **General**.
4. Select **Categories**.
5. Select **Add category**.
6. In the **Category** field, select **OFFICE AND DESK ACCESSORIES (OFFICE AND DESK ACCESSORIES)**.
7. In the **Vendor category status** field, select **Preferred**. It's possible to specify more than one preferred vendor for a category.  
8. Select **Save**.
9. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules > Procurement and sourcing > Procurement categories**.
10. In the tree, select **CORP PROCUREMENT CATEGORIES\OFFICE AND DESK ACCESSORIES**.
11. Expand the **Vendors** section. Check if the vendor that you selected appears as a preferred vendor for the Office and desk accessories category. If you're running this procedure as a task guide, you may have to select the **Unlock** button to be able to scroll down to the list of vendors.  It's also possible to add preferred and approved vendors on this page.

13. Select **No** in the **Inherit vendors from parent category:** field.
