# Submit and approve project budgets

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure shows you how to create and submit the budget for a project. 

When you create a project budget, you can enter estimated revenues and costs for a project, and then use those to control actual project transactions. In project budgeting, all original budgets and revisions must be sent to project workflow for approval. Workflow gives you increased control over the process and creates a change history record.
