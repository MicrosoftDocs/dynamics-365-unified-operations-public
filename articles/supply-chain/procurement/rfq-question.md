# Responding to vendor questions on Request for quotations

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When your agency has sent a request for quotation (RFQ), vendors sometimes have questions that pertain to the request. Vendors that have questions related to an RFP can submit their questions and read the answers on **Vendor collaboration** page, when you make that page available to them. When vendor questions are accepted, **Questions and answers** is available on the **Request for quotation bid** page on **Vendor collaboration**, and for your agency through the **Request for quotation** page, **Questions and answers**. 

Users can publish answers to vendor questions more than once. Vendors can't no longer post questions after a vendor is selected and the RFQ is awarded, or after the cutoff date for questions is reached.

## Setting up for vendor questions
When creating a request for quotation, you determine whether vendors can ask questions about the RFQ.
1. Navigate to **Procurement and sourcing > Requests for quotations** then click **New > Request for quotation** 
2. In the **New request for quotation** page, **Header** to set the **Vendor question options** fields to allow questions before a certain date.
- Set the **Allow vendor question** option to **Yes** so the Vendors can enter questions. Users can enter and answer questions and designate commonly asked questions to publish for vendors when the RFQ is sent to vendors.
3. Optional: In the **Cutoff date** field, define the final date by which questions must be submitted. If no cutoff date is entered, questions are accepted as long as the RFQ is open and accepting bids.
4. Click **Save** to save the RFQ.
5. Click **Send** to send the RFQ to the vendors for bidding.

## Entering and replying to vendor questions
Vendors enter questions in the **Vendor Collaboration > Request for quotations bid** page, **Vendor questions** FastTab. The question is visible only to the vendor and users.

## Entering a vendor question
1. In Vendor collaboration, in the **Request for quotation bid** page, click **Questions and answers**, and then 
click **+ Ask a question**.

[Note!] Alternately, a user can enter questions for a vendor on the **Request for quotation** page, by clicking **Manage replies**, **Edit RFQ reply** then clicking **Questions and asnwers**.

2. On the **Question** field, enter the question text.
3. Click the **Submit**. Repeat steps 1-3 to add a question.
4. When done, click **Save** to save your questions.

## Replying to a single vendor
The question and answer are visible only to the vendor and users.
1. On the **Request for quotations** page, click the **Questions and answers** to display the **Questions and answers** page.
2. Click **Edit**
1. Enter text in the **Answer** field to respond to the vendor's question.
2. Check the **Direct response** box.
3. Click **Save** to save your replies.
4. Click **Send answers** to send the answers to the vendor.

## Replying to all vendors
If you receive the same question from multiple vendors, you can group the questions and respond with one answer. All vendors receive notification when the commonly asked questions and answers are published. The vendors and anyone with access to the request for quotation can view the summary of questions and answers.

1. On the **Request for quotations** page, click the **Questions and answers** to display the **Questions and answers** page.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Choose a code for the common question, such as the letter 'a.'
4. For each line that asks a similar question, enter the code in the **Group code** field. For example, for each line asking about item color, enter 'a.'
5. Choose one of the lines with the code value, and enter the question and answer the way you want them to read in the summary that will be available when the questions and answers are published (**Group question, Group answer** fields).
6. Optional: You can mark the **Direct response** check box to send the answers only to the selected vendors.
7. Click **Save** to save your answers.
8. Optional: You can revert the questions and answers to the previously published values if you want to undo your changes.
9. Click **Send answers** to send your answers to the vendors.

## Changing RFQ to allow or disallow questions
You can make changes to allow or disallow questions to RFQs until the RFQ is awarded. You can also extend or shorten the time frame in which vendors can submit questions.
For published RFQs, you must modify a request for quotation  to allow or disallow vendor questions or adjust the time frame for questions.
