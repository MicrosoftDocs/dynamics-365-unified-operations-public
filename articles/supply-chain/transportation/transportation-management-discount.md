# Transportation management discounts

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Transportation management lets you set up discounts to be applied on top of the transportation price calculated by the rating engine. You can specify each discount either as a percentage of charges or as a fixed amount.

To set up discounts for transportation management, go to **Transportation management \> Setup \> Rating \> Discounts**.

You can choose whether to pass the discount on to your customer (by setting the discount type to customer) or to retain it in the company (by setting the discount type to shipper). This lets you define a setup in which you earn a margin on the calculated freight charges.

You can set up multiple qualifiers for each discount, such as carrier, carrier service, delivery terms, customer, destination, and more.
