# USMCA certification of origin

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This feature lets you print the certification of origin documents required by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The *USMCA certification of origin document* contains the minimum data elements required for declaration. Some data elements can be pre-filled before printing while others must be filled in manually after printing. To obtain preferential tariff treatment, the document must be completed and in the possession of the importer at the time the declaration is made. The document may be completed by the importer, exporter, or producer.

You can print the document for a single shipment from the **All shipments** list page or from the **Shipment details** page.

The document is only accessible when the country on the primary address for the legal entity is the United States.

Depending on the document print selection, the document can be pre-filled with data from your system. It is possible to change or add data to the printed document by exporting the printed document to an editable format, such as Microsoft Word. After export, you can apply any required changes before a declaration is made.

## Turn on the USMCA feature

Before you can use the USMCA feature, it must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Transportation management*

## Document content

The USMCA certification of origin document contains the following data elements:

### Certifying party

The document can be printed for both inbound and outbound shipments. Select *Importer* as **Certifying party** for inbound shipments only.

Some of this information must be entered manually after you generate the document.

### Invoice number

The IDs of sales invoices related to shipments are printed on the document irrespective of the blanket period. Invoice numbers are printed irrespective of the **Is single shipment** selection.

### Item details

The document provides several sections that list specific item details, which are:

- **SKU number**: Prints the item number of the released product.

- **Description**: Prints either the description or name for the released product. If a description in the user's language exists, then this is printed. If no such description exists, then the name in the user's language is printed. If that name doesn't exist, then the item name is printed.

The ISO code for the country of origin is printed based on the country/region of destination in the shipment delivery address and the item. If no country of origin data has been set up, then this value reverts back to the setting found at **Released product \> Foreign trade \> Origin**. If still no country of origin data is found, then you must manually enter the country of origin after generating the document.

### Certifier signature and date
