# Transportation management zone master

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Transport management lets you divide geographic locations into zones. Dividing locations into zones can help to:

- **Simplify transportation pricing** – Zone-wise pricing can be simpler than individual location-based pricing, especially when transportation locations are scattered.
- **Optimize load planning** – By consolidating loads by zones.
- **Optimize route planning** – By assigning specific route plans to specific zones.

You define zones based on the metadata field values (such as country, zip code range, or carrier service) that qualify each zone. Zone definitions aren't required if your transportation pricing doesn't employ a zone concept.
