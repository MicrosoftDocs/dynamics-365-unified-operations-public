# Transportation management zone master

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Transport management lets you divide geographic locations into zones. Dividing locations into zones can help to:

- **Simplify transportation pricing** – Zone-wise pricing can be simpler than individual location-based pricing, especially when transportation locations are scattered.
- **Optimize load planning** – By consolidating loads by zones.
- **Optimize route planning** – By assigning specific route plans to specific zones.

You define zones based on the metadata field values (such as country/region, zip code range, or carrier service) that qualify each zone. Zone definitions aren't required if your transportation pricing doesn't employ a zone concept.
