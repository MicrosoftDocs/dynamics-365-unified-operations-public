# Set up a carrier fuel index

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This guide shows how to create a fuel index region, a fuel index and a carrier fuel index. The fuel index region specifies which region the fuel index should apply to, and the fuel index specifies a fuel price for a particular period of time. To reflect the change in fuel prices over time, you can associate multiple fuel indexes with a carrier.  These tasks are normally done by a transportation coordinator. You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF or using your own data.
