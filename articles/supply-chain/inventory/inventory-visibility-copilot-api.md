<!-- KFM: Preview until further notice -->

The inventory visibility service interacts with Copilot in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to provide a natural-language inventory search feature. It lets users ask questions about inventory and receive answers in real time. The functionality is available both from inside the Inventory Visibility app and through APIs (which developers can code against to create an interactive inventory chatbot for their own applications and web sites). By using Copilot, organizations can gain control over their inventory and enhance operational efficiency, ultimately leading to increased profitability and improved customer satisfaction.

For example, a user might send the following natural-language query:

> What's the inventory for Silver Chronograph Watch in USMF?

And Copilot could respond with the following answer:

> Silver Chronograph Watch's product number is 81325. There are 888 Silver Chronograph Watches available in USMF. Here are the details:
>
> Location: Site 1, Location 13
>
> Available ordered quantity: 888<br>
> Available physical quantity: 888<br>
> Physical inventory quantity: 888<br>
> Posted quantity: 888

### Open the Copilot panel

Follow these steps to open the Copilot sidecar panel in the Inventory Visibility app.

1. In Power Apps, open the **Inventory Visibility** app.
1. In the **Address** field of your browser, append the following parameters to the URL to enable the Copilot sidecar panel to load.

    ```text
    &flags=FCB.InitializeCopilotSidePaneOnBoot%3Dtrue%2CFCB.UsePVAInCopilot%3Dtrue%2CFCB.IsPPAPIHostedBotEnabled%3Dtrue&useServerResources=true
    ```

1. To open the panel, select the **Copilot** button :::image type="icon" source="media/copilot-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top-right corner.

### Chat with Copilot

In the Copilot panel, you can chat with Copilot to get real-time product and on-hand inventory data by using natural language. Copilot responds to your questions based on the available data in the Inventory Visibility service.

## Use the query API

You submit inventory queries and receive results using the query API, which is defined as follows:

```txt
Path:
    /nl/iv/{environmentId}/query
Method:
    Post
Headers:
    Api-Version="1.0"
Authorization="Bearer $access_token"
x-ms-client-session-id={ your session id }       // New session Id will clear chat history. 
ContentType:
    application/json
Body:
    {
        "Text" : { Your text input }
    }
```

The path URL should resemble the following example: `https://inventoryservice-copilot.weu-il301.gateway.prod.island.powerapps.com/nl/iv/{{Supply_Chain_Management_environment_id}}/query`.

The following example shows sample body content.

```json
   {
        "Text" : "What's the inventory of product D0001 in organization USMF, site 1, location 11?"
   }
```

You can choose a level of logging detail for the request by adding the optional `LogLevel` parameter in the body and setting it to `Debug`, `Trace`, or `Information`.
