# Flexible sampling plans

A flexible sampling plan defines the criteria for inspecting units of items that are randomly picked from a lot to determine if the entire lot passes or fails based on the results of the inspected samplings. Typically, the number of units chosen for inspection is proportional to the total size of the lot based on rational criterion. The quality association defined for a plan identifies the activity to be inspected. For example, the activity might be a quality order to inspect a product before it is released to a customer in a sales order, or it could be a quality order to inspect a manufactured product upon completion of production.

Flexible sampling plans offer other features that allow you to modify your criteria over time based on prior testing results.

- **Sampling size variations** – Flexible sampling provides the ability to vary your item sampling over time based on test findings. For example, for the first five rounds of testing, you inspect 50% of the receipt. Assuming no quality failures were found in those rounds, you may decide to reduce the inspection sampling size to only 10% of the receipt for subsequent rounds. Rounds identify the number of times that a test is performed at a specific level before moving to the next level in the testing plan. For example, if a level requires 5 rounds of testing, then the assigned item sampling should be used for all 5 rounds before moving to the next level, which may use a different item sampling.

- **Test group flexibility** – Using a flexible sampling plan, you can change a plan's current test group, which identifies the individual tests performed, to a different test group based on inspection results. For example, if prior testing results show minimal problems in the quality of receipts, you might choose to change the test group to a less stringent set of tests. You can also specify different test groups for different levels in a flexible sampling plan.

    - **Skip lot inspections** – Skip lot inspections, which are an alternative to lot-by-lot inspections, allow you to skip a set number of goods during testing. For example, a Quality manager may set up a flexible sampling plan for a long-time supplier to inspect a quantity of 10 units and then skip the next 10 units. This decision was made based on the vendor having demonstrated that the quality of their receipts is very good. Receipts that do not require inspection are put away and a quality order is not generated. With the flexibility to perform lot-by-lot inspections instead of unit-by-unit inspections, as well as the use of other features such as sampling size variations, skip lot inspections, and test group flexibility, this type of inspection plan helps to minimize time, costs, handling damage, and inspection errors for your company.

## Setting up Flexible sampling plans

You set up new flexible sampling plans in the **Flexible sampling plans** form. Each plan is made up of different testing levels that identify the testing process, such as which test group and/or item sampling, and the order in which the levels are performed. For each plan you create, if the **Alert** or **Expire AVL/Alert** option is set up for a plan level, then you can assign an alert role to be notified if the specified number of failures for that level is reached.

After you set up the criteria for each of the plan's levels, you then establish the quality association for the plan to identify the testing activities (for example, purchases, specific vendor account, and specific item) and to generate quality orders based on test results. You establish the quality association on the **Specifications** FastTab in the **Quality associations** form.

**Example:**

A manufacturing company currently uses item sampling functionality for testing goods received in shipments. However, to reduce costs associated with testing, they need greater flexibility in their testing approach. The company's testing statistics over the past year show minimal exceptions were found during their inspections of a particular item. To reduce costs, they decide to implement flexible sampling. With flexible sampling they can not only vary or reduce the sampling size based on prior testing results, but they can skip certain lots from testing as well.

| **Label Name** | **Description** | **Examples/Hints** |
| **Buttons** |  |  |
| New | Add a new flexible sampling plan. |  |
| Delete | Delete a flexible sampling plan.</br>**Note:** You cannot delete a flexible sampling plan code if dependent quality orders are currently using the plan or if activity is being tracked against the plan. To delete the plan you must first delete any dependent quality orders as well as any tracking activity. |  |
| Copy plan | Copy an existing flexible sampling plan to use in creating a new plan. For example, you might copy an existing plan that is like the plan you want to create, which reduces the time involved in setting up the new plan. |  |
| View activities | View the activities associated with a flexible sampling plan. These activities might include which test groups and samplings were used to create the quality orders, as well as any quality tests that were skipped based on the criteria defined in the plan. |  |
| **Fields** |  |  |
| Flexible sampling plan code | Define the identifier for a new flexible sampling plan. |  |
| Description | Enter or view a brief description for the new flexible sampling plan. |  |
| Alert role | Select or view the role for the employee who is to receive alerts when certain types of quality failures occur. |  |
| Last level | Select the level number for the last activity to be performed in this flexible sampling plan process. The last level is open ended, and you cannot specify several rounds for this level. |  |
| Approved | Check if the plan is approved. You can only approve a plan if the plan has a last level and the fail and pass action level on all the plan lines are set and identify valid levels in the plan. If there is a fail action code then the plan must also have an alert role. | Only approved plans are available for selection on Quality associations |
| Level | Select or view the level number assigned to this activity level. |  |
| Item sampling | Select or view the identifier that determines the specific sampling size, for example a 10 percent sampling or a 50-unit quantity sampling. |  |
| Test group | Select or view the identifier for the test group that is responsible for creating the quality order for the specific level in the flexible sampling plan. |  |
| Rounds | Enter or view the number of testing rounds for a specific flexible sampling plan level that must pass quality order validation to advance to the next level. Once you select a level for the **Last level** field, any **Rounds** value you entered for that level is removed from the plan. It is removed from the plan intentionally to allow the last level to continue indefinitely until several failures regress the plan to a prior level.</br>**Note:** The last level in the testing plan does not allow rounds because all future tests would then remain at this level indefinitely until the appropriate number of fails is met to revert the plan to a prior level. | Assume a quality association has been set up to test purchase order registrations for a certain vendor.</br>The vendor's flexible sampling plan requires that 10% of every registration be tested for 5 rounds. So if I receive 100 units, then a quality order is generated to test 10 of those units. The quality order for the first registration passes. However, the second quality order fails, but the next three pass. If round 6 passes, then the first level in the plan is accomplished as the number of passed rounds required has been met. |
| Time span (days) | Enter or view the number of days by which the specified number of rounds must be completed. This field is optional.</br>**Note:** This field works in conjunction with the **Rounds** field. If a time span is defined, then the specified number of rounds must pass inspection within this time frame to advance testing to the next level. For example, if you set the time span to 60 days and the rounds to 10, then ten quality orders for this quality association must pass within 60 days to advance to the next level in the plan. |  |
| Skip | Select this check box to enable skip lot sampling, which allows for only a fraction of the submitted lots to be inspected. When you select this check box, you must enter the skip range in the **Frequency** fields. |  |
| Test frequency | If the **Skip** field is selected, enter the first number in the Skip range. |  |
| Out of frequency | If the **Skip** field is selected, enter the last number in the Skip range. | Assume the quality association is set for Production order registrations. The flexible sampling plan associated with this reference type uses the Skip feature where the **Test frequency** field is set to **1** and **out of frequency** is set to **5**. Based on these settings, a quality order is generated to test 1 out of every 5 registrations. The determination as to which registrations of the 5 are tested and which ones are skipped is randomly made. |
| Number of fails | Enter or view the number of failed tests allowed before the flexible sampling plan reverts to a previous testing level, which may be more or less restrictive than the current test based on prior testing results. If the **Consecutive** check box is also selected, then the number of fails must be consecutive fails before the plan reverts to a prior level. | A vendor might initially define a plan to test 10 out of 40 receipts to minimize costs associated with testing. However, because recent testing results support a notable increase in failures, the current level ends and a different level to test 20 out of 40 receipts replaces it. To the contrary, if the vendor's testing quality is consistent with no failures, then the level may be replaced by a level that requires a lower number of fails. |
| Consecutive | Select this check box if the number of fails specified in the **Number of fails** field must be consecutive failures. If selected and the number of consecutive fails is reached, then the appropriate action based on the fail action level and code is initiated. | If the number of fails allowed is set to **2** and this check box is selected, then two consecutive fails generate a predefined fail action, such as issuing an alert notification to the Quality manager. |
| Fail action level | Enter or view the level of action that is initiated when the quantity in the **Number of fails** field is reached. This action indicates that more testing is required. If the **Consecutive** check box is also selected, then the number of fails must be consecutive fails to initiate the action. For example, if two consecutive quality orders fail at Level 3, then the action defined may require that testing start over at Level 1.</br>You can assign any prior level that is currently defined in the flexible sampling plan that is at least equal to or less than the current level. |  |
| Fail action code | Select the action code that defines the action to take when the failure criteria is met or exceeded for the flexible sampling plan. All of the actions return the test sampling process to the fail action level.</br><ul></br><li><blockquote></br>**Alert** — Return the test sampling to the Fail action level and issue an alert to the alert role specified.</br></blockquote></li></br><li><blockquote></br>**Expire/AVL/Alert** — Return the test sampling to the Fail action level, issue an alert to the alert role specified, and change the vendor or item in the **Approved Vendor List** (AVL) to **Expired** if the quality association is purchasing and an AVL is in effect for that vendor.</br></blockquote></li></br><li><blockquote></br>**None** — Return the test sampling to the Fail action level specified for the current level.</br></blockquote></li></br></ul> |  |
| Pass action level | Enter or view the level of action that is initiated when the tests pass for this line.</br>You can assign any level that is currently defined in the flexible sampling plan. |  |

## Tracking activities for Flexible sampling plans

To inquire about and track activities associated to a flexible sampling plan, you use the **Flexible sampling plan activities** form. For example, the activities for a plan might specify which test groups and samplings were used for creating quality orders, as well as which quality orders were skipped based on skipping criteria defined in the plan.

Each activity captures pertinent information about the account, item, and testing level at the most granular level. For example, if a flexible sampling plan code is associated with a quality association for All vendors and a specific Item quality group, then the information displayed includes the reference type (Purchase), vendor's account number, specific item number, and the current testing level.
