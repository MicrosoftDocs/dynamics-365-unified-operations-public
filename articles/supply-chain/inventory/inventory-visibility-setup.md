## <a name="install-add-in"></a>Install the Inventory Visibility Add-in

Before you install the add-in, register an application and add a client secret to Microsoft Entra under your Azure subscription. For instructions, see [Register an application](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) and [Add a client secret](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-certificate). Be sure to make a note of the **Application (client) ID**, **Client secret**, and **Tenant ID** values, because you'll need them later.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than one environment, create a different Microsoft Entra application for each of them. If you use the same application ID and tenant ID to install the Inventory Visibility Add-in for different environments, a token issue will occur for older environments. As a result, only the latest installation will be valid.

You can install the Inventory Visibility Add-in from either of two places:

- **[Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs.md)** – Lifecycle Services is a collaboration portal that provides a unified collaborative environment together with a set of regularly updated services that help you manage the application lifecycle of your implementations.
- **[Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation)** – The Power Platform admin center provides a unified portal where administrators can manage environments and settings for Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages, and Microsoft Copilot Studio.

### Install the Inventory Visibility Add-in from Lifecycle Services

After you register an application and add a client secret to Microsoft Entra ID, follow these steps to install the Inventory Visibility Add-in.

1. Sign in to [Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Index).
1. On the home page, select the project where your environment is deployed.
1. On the project page, select the environment where you want to install the add-in.
1. On the environment page, scroll down until you find the **Environment add-ins** section in the **Power Platform integration** section. There, you can find the Dataverse environment name. Confirm that the Dataverse environment name is the one that you want to use for Inventory Visibility.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you start the installation, you should check for linking mismatch warnings in Lifecycle Services. To do so, open the details page for your environment in Lifecycle Services and look for a warning that resembles the following example: "Microsoft has detected that your environment is linked via dual-write to a different destination than specified in Power Platform Integration, which isn't recommended." If you see this warning, it's possible that your dual-write environment is linked to a Dataverse instance, but Lifecycle Services isn't set up for Power Platform integration. This linking mismatch can cause unexpected behavior. For information about how to fix this issue, see [Linking mismatch](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/lcs-setup.md#linking-mismatch). After the linking mismatch is fixed, you can install Inventory Visibility.

1. In the **Environment add-ins** section, select **Install a new add-in**.
1. Select the **Install a new add-in** link. A list of available add-ins appears.
1. In the list, select **Inventory Visibility**.
1. Set the following fields for your environment:

    - **Microsoft Entra application (client) ID** – Enter the Microsoft Entra application ID that you created and made a note of earlier.
    - **Microsoft Entra tenant ID** – Enter the tenant ID that you made a note of earlier.

    :::image type="content" source="media/inventory-visibility-setup.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Setup add-in page." lightbox="media/inventory-visibility-setup.png":::

1. Agree to the terms and conditions by selecting the **Terms and conditions** checkbox.
1. Select **Install**. The status of the add-in is shown as **Installing**. When the installation is completed, refresh the page. The status should change to **Installed**.
1. In Dataverse, select the **Apps** section in the left navigation, and verify that the **Inventory Visibility** Power Apps is installed successfully.

> [!NOTE]
> If the system warns you that you don't have permission to install Inventory Visibility on Lifecycle Services, you must contact the administrator to modify your permission.
>
> If it takes more than an hour to install from the Lifecycle Services page, then your user account probably lacks permission to install solutions in the Dataverse environment. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
>
> 1. Cancel the Inventory Visibility Add-in installation process from the Lifecycle Services page.
> 1. [Install the Inventory Visibility Add-in from the Power Platform admin center](#install-from-power-platform).
> 1. After the installation is completed, go back to the Lifecycle Services page, and check the status of the Inventory Visibility Add-in.

### <a name="install-from-power-platform"></a>Install the Inventory Visibility Add-in from the Power Platform admin center

After you register an application and add a client secret to Microsoft Entra ID, you must install the Inventory Visibility Add-in.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unless you using the [unified developer experience](/power-platform/developer/unified-experience/finance-operations-dev-overview), you should check for linking mismatch warnings in Lifecycle Services before you install Inventory Visibility. To do so, open the details page for your environment in Lifecycle Services and look for a warning that resembles the following example: "Microsoft has detected that your environment is linked via dual-write to a different destination than specified in Power Platform Integration, which isn't recommended." If you see this warning, it's possible that your dual-write environment is linked to a Dataverse instance, but Lifecycle Services isn't set up for Power Platform integration. This linking mismatch can cause unexpected behavior. For information about how to fix this issue, see [Linking mismatch](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/lcs-setup.md#linking-mismatch). After the linking mismatch is fixed, you can install Inventory Visibility.

### <a name="setup-inventory-visibility-integration"></a>Set up Inventory Visibility integration

Once you've installed the add-in, prepare your Supply Chain Management system to work with it by following these steps.

1. In Supply Chain Management, open the **[Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)** workspace, and turn on the *Inventory Visibility integration* feature. As of Supply Chain Management version 10.0.45, it's mandatory and can't be turned off.
1. Go to **Inventory Management** \> **Set up** \> **Inventory Visibility Integration parameters**.
1. Open the **General** tab and make the following settings:

    - **Inventory Visibility endpoint** – Enter the URL of the environment where you're running Inventory Visibility. Learn more in [Find your service endpoint and read the configuration](inventory-visibility-power-platform.md#endpoint).
    - **Maximum number of records in a single request** – Set to the maximum number of records to include in a single request. You must enter a positive integer less than or equal to 1000. The default value is 512. We strongly recommend keeping the default value unless you've received advice from Microsoft Support or are otherwise certain that you need to change it.

1. The following optional features enhance the functionality of Inventory Visibility. Decide whether you want to use any of these features. If you do, set them up. (You can also set them up later.)

    - **Soft reservations and offsets** – Soft reservations help organizations achieve a single source of truth for available inventory, especially during the order fulfillment process. For information about how to enable and set up this feature, see [Inventory Visibility reservations](inventory-visibility-reservations.md).
    - **Support for warehouse management processes (WMS) items** – This feature lets you use WMS items with Inventory Visibility. For information about how to enable and set up this feature, see [Inventory Visibility support for WMS items](inventory-visibility-whs-support.md).
    - **Inventory summary** – This feature provides an inventory summary for products together with all dimensions. For information about how to enable and set up this feature, see [Inventory summary](inventory-visibility-inventory-summary.md).
    - **Preload a streamlined on-hand query** – This feature provides an aggregated inventory summary for products by configured dimensions. For information about how to enable and set up this feature, see [Preload a streamlined on-hand query](inventory-visibility-preload-on-hand.md).
    - **Track time-series inventory in Inventory Visibility** – This feature enables Supply Chain Management to send its on-hand change schedule to Inventory Visibility to support available-to-promise (ATP) calculations. For information about how to enable and set up this feature, see [Track time-series inventory in Inventory Visibility](inventory-visibility-track-atp.md).

1. After you finish setting up the optional features you selected, go to **Inventory Management** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Inventory Visibility Integration**, and enable the job. All inventory change events from Supply Chain Management will now be posted to Inventory Visibility.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the Inventory Visibility integration job, if you receive an error that states that you must update the partition schema, see the [Update partition schema to two if you get an error when enabling the Inventory Visibility integration job](#update-partition-two) section of this article for instructions.

### <a name="setup-inventory-visibility-integration-hotfixes-link"></a>Inventory Visibility integration hotfixes

For a list of the latest hotfixes available for Inventory Visibility integration features in Supply Chain Management, see [Recent Dynamics 365 SCM hotfixes](https://github.com/microsoft/Inventory-Visibility-Add-in-Examples/blob/main/Troubleshooting%20Guide/Recent%20Dynamics%20365%20SCM%20hotfixes.md).

### <a name="update-partition-two"></a>Update partition schema to two if you get an error when enabling the Inventory Visibility integration job

When you try to enable the Inventory Visibility integration batch job from Supply Chain Management, you might receive the following error:

> Cannot sync more than 500000 records in the same warehouse. To mitigate this issue, update partition schema to 2 in Inventory Visibility Add-in.

If you receive this error, follow these steps to update your [partition schema](inventory-visibility-power-platform.md#data-partition) to help prevent out-of-memory issues. If you don't receive this error, you can skip this procedure.

1. In Power Apps, [delete all inventory data](inventory-visibility-power-platform.md#delete-data).
1. Set up a system to send [API requests](inventory-visibility-api.md) to Inventory Visibility.
1. After data is deleted, call the `Get` API with a body of `none` to get all partition IDs (by using `/api/environment/{environmentId}/allpartitionids`). Review the response to confirm that data has been completely cleared. The result should be empty.
1. Call the `Post` API with a body of `none` to change the partition schema (by using `/api/environment/{environmentId}/updatePartitionSchema?newversion=2`).
1. In Power Apps, enable the [advanced warehouse inventory](inventory-visibility-whs-support.md) feature, and [update the configuration](inventory-visibility-power-platform.md#update-configuration).
1. In Power Apps, [review the runtime configuration](inventory-visibility-power-platform.md#endpoint). The `CachePartitonIdVersion` field should show a value of `ByLocationAndProductIdMod64`.
1. In Supply Chain Management, go to **Inventory Management** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Inventory Visibility Integration**, and enable the job.

## <a name="update-add-in"></a>Update the Inventory Visibility Add-in

To update an installed version of the Inventory Visibility Add-in to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
1. On the navigation pane, select **Environments**.
1. Open the environment where you want to update the Inventory Visibility Add-in.
1. In the **Resources** section, select **Dynamics 365 apps**.
1. In the list, find the row where **Name** is *Dynamics 365 Inventory Visibility*. Check the value in the **Status** column for this row.

    - If the **Status** is *Installed*, then you're already running the latest version so you can skip the rest of this procedure.
    - If the **Status** is *Update available*, then an update is available. Continue with the next step.

    > [!TIP]
    > To see which version of the add-in you're currently running, regardless of the status, open the **More application actions** menu (ellipsis button), and then select **Details**.

1. If the page shows that an update is available, open the **More application actions** menu (ellipsis button), and then select **Update**.
1. In the dialog box that appears, select the **I agree to the terms of service** checkbox, and then select **Update**.
1. A pop-up window prompts you to confirm the action. To proceed, enter the name of your environment in the field provided, and then select **Update**.
