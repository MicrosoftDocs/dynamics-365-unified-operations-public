# Charges for nonconformance operations

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to create quality charges that can be used with operations for a nonconformance.

You use the **Quality charges** page to define the types of charges that can be added to operations for a nonconformance. Charges let you track details about fees or charges that you owe to a customer for nonconforming products, or that a vendor owes to you for nonconforming products that you received. You might also use charges to track costs that are required for external vendors or services to perform an operation.

## Examples of quality charges

You work for a manufacturing company. Your company has contracts with several vendors. Those contracts outline standards for on-time shipment, damages, and product quality for items. Likewise, several of your customers have agreements with your company about returns, damages, and product quality.

A fee structure is defined for each circumstance and specified in the contract. You can configure quality charges to outline the various types of charges, such as *Damages*, *Late shipment*, and *Quality*. Then, when you create a nonconformance, you add one or more operations. For each operation, you select **Charges** to define the details about the fees.

## Create a quality charge

1. Go to **Inventory management \> Setup \> Quality management \> Quality charges**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a row to the grid. Then set the following fields for the new row:

    - **Charges code** – Enter a unique ID or name for the quality charge.
    - **Description** – Enter a detailed description of the quality charge.

1. Close the page.

## Add a quality charge to an operation for a nonconformance

For details about how to add operations to a nonconformance and apply charges to them, see [Operations for nonconformances](quality-operations.md).
