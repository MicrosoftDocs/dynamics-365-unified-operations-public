# Create and process nonconformances

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to perform nonconformance management based on an existing quality order. Typically, nonconformance management is done by a quality clerk. As a prerequisite, you must have a quality order available. (For information about how to create a quality order, see [Inspect the quality of goods](inspect-quality-goods.md).)

Before a user can process the approval of a nonconformance, a worker must be assigned to them in the **Person** field on the **Users** page. Additionally, before the user can use the document notes, the **Enable document handling** option must be set to *Yes* in their user options.

## Create a nonconformance

To create a nonconformance, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Inventory management \> Periodic tasks \> Quality management \> Non conformances**.
1. On the Action pane, select **New**.
1. In the **Create non conformance** dialog box, in **Problem type** field, select the type of problem that was found during the inspection process.
1. Select **OK**.

## Approve or reject a nonconformance

To approve or reject a nonconformance, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Inventory management \> Periodic tasks \> Quality management \> Non conformances**.
1. In the list, select the nonconformance that you want to update.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can add a correction only to nonconformances that are approved.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Functions \> Approve non conformance** to approve the nonconformance or **Functions \> Refuse non conformance** to reject it. You can associate approved nonconformances with [related operations](../quality-operations.md). In this way, you can record work that is done as part of the nonconformance handling and the processing of correction handling.
1. You're prompted to confirm your selection. Select **Yes** to continue.

## Add operations and other details to nonconformances

After you've created a nonconformance, you can start to add related operations and specify additional information about those operations. You can add related operations only to nonconformances that are approved.

Besides the basic information, you can add the following details to an operation:

- **Items** – You can create a list of items that are consumed to perform the correction. For example, the items might be products that are required to repair equipment or ingredients that are required to rework a finished product.
- **Quality charges** – You can create a list of charges that are incurred or billed out to external sources.
- **Timesheet** – You can create a log of the time that each worker spends on the operation.

The remaining settings are optional. The cost for each item, quality charges, and the timesheet are summed and shown on the operation. You can't directly edit the **Cost** field on the operation.
