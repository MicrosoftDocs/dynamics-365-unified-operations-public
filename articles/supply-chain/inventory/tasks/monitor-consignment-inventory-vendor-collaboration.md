# Monitor consignment inventory using vendor collaboration

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This procedure shows how to use vendor collaboration to see information about the stock level of product that you placed in consignment with a customer. You can also monitor the consumption of the stock when the customer takes ownership of the inventory.

## View consumed inventory

To view the inventory that the customer has consumed from the consignment stock, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Vendor collaboration** \> **Consignment inventory** \> **Products received from consignment inventory**. The list shows the product receipt lines that were generated when ownership of the consignment inventory changed from the vendor to the customer. You might have to scroll to the right to see quantities and other information. You can use the information in this list to generate invoices for your customer. You can also export the data to Microsoft Excel.
1. Select **View purchase order**.
1. Expand the **Line details** section. The line is marked as *Consignment*, and the header section shows that the purchase order has a status of *Received*.  
1. Close the page.

## View on-hand inventory

To view on-hand inventory, go to **Vendor collaboration** \> **Consignment inventory** \> **On-hand consignment inventory**. The **On-hand consignment inventory** page shows the stock that you own at the customer's warehouse. You can show additional dimensions, such as the site and warehouse, by selecting the Display dimensions tab.
