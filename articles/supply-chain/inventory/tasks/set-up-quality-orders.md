# Set up quality orders

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure shows you how to enable a quality management process where incoming inventory must be inspected immediately after arrival registration. The procedure will typically be carried out by a quality manager. The process includes the creation of a quality group, to define the items that are going to be sampled, and a test group to group the tests that are to be performed on items in the quality group. You can run this guide in the USMF demo data company.


## Enable quality management
1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Inventory and warehouse management parameters.
2. Click the Quality management tab.
3. Set the Use quality management option to Yes.
4. Click Report setup.
    * In USMF, the report setup for quality management is already defined. If this wasn’t done, you’d add new lines here for the different report types, and select the type of document to be used for each report.  
5. Close the page.
6. Close the page.

## Create a test

3. In the Test field, type a value.
4. In the Description field, type a value.
5. In the Type field, select 'Option'.
    * In this example, we'll select "Option" which will make it possible to assign the test results based on pre-defined values.  
6. Click Save.
7. Close the page.

## Create Test variables to define the way test results are recorded

    * This value relates to the Quantity specification that’s selected in the adjacent field.  
6. Expand or collapse the Process section.
7. Select or clear the Full blocking check box.
    * If you select this option, the whole lot or order line quantity is blocked if a test is failed. If you don't select it, only the items in the quality order are blocked.  
8. Click Save.
9. Close the page.

## Create a quality group
1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Quality groups.
2. Click New.
3. In the Quality group field, type a value.

6. Click Add items.
7. Select the Item number row
    * In this example the filtering will be run based on  the item number.  
8. In the Criteria field, type a value.
    * For example, type T* to filter on the item numbers that start with T.  
9. Click OK.
10. Click OK.
11. Click Item quality groups.
12. Close the page.
13. Close the page.

## Create a test group
1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Test groups.
2. Click New.
3. In the Test group field, type a value.
    * Give the Test group a name that will help you remember what kind of tests are being run, and which quality group it should be associated with. For example, it it’s to be used with a quality group that selects items starting with “T”, you could call it “T-item tests”.  
4. In the Description field, type a value.
5. In the Item sampling field, select the item sampling line that you created before.
6. In the list, find and select the desired record.
7. Click Add.
