# Set up prerequisites for management

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Use this procedure to enable nonconformance management processes. A nonconformance describes a procedure or item that has a quality problem, where the descriptive information includes the source and type of problem. This procedure uses the USMF demo data company. This procedure is typically performed by a quality manager.

2. Click the Quality management tab.
3. Select Yes in the Use quality management field.
    * Select this parameter to enable quality management processes for the company.  
4. In the Hourly rate field, enter a number.
    * Use the Hourly rate field to enter an hourly labor rate in the local currency. The hourly rate is used for calculating costs for operations that are related to a nonconformance. The hourly rate and calculated costs provide reference information for a nonconformance, and they do not interact with other functionality.  
5. Click Report setup.
    * This page allows you define the quality report note types that will be used on different kinds of quality management reports.  
6. Close the page.

## Enable user for nonconformance processing
1. Go to System administration > Users > Users.
    * To process the approval of a nonconformance the user who  approves or rejects nonconformances must have a “Name” value assigned on the Users page. To use the document notes, the user must also have Document handling activated in the user options.  
2. Use the Quick Filter to find records. For example, filter on the Name field with a value of 'Ricardo'.
    * Use the filter to find the user who will be approving or rejecting the nonconformance records.  
3. In the list, click the link in the selected row.
    * To process the approval of a nonconformance, make sure the user who approves or rejects nonconformances has a “Name” value assigned on the Users page.
