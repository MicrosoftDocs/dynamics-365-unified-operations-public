# Quality management item sampling

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Item sampling is used as part of a quality association. It defines the amount of current physical inventory that must be inspected. Sampling can be based on fixed quantities, a percentage, or a full license plate.

## Set up item sampling

Follow these steps to set up item sampling.

1. Go to **Inventory management \> Setup \> Quality control \> Item sampling**.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Item sampling** field, enter a value.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a value.
1. In the **Value** field, enter a number. This value is related to the quantity specification value that is selected in the adjacent field.
1. In the **Process** section, select the **Full blocking** check box if the whole lot or order line quantity should be blocked if a test is failed. If this check box is cleared, only the items in the quality order will be blocked if a test is failed.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Quality management for warehouse processes* feature provides additional item sampling capabilities. It adds the concept of *item sampling scope* and lets you define a full license plate as the quantity specification. If you've turned on this feature, see [Quality management for warehouse processes](quality-management-for-warehouses-processes.md).
