# Quality associations

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how you can use quality associations in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to automatically generate quality orders that are related to your sales, purchase, and production processes.

A quality association defines all the following information for a quality order that is generated:

- The transaction event
- The set of tests that must be performed on the items
- The acceptable quality level (AQL)
- The sampling plan

You must define a quality association for each variation in a business process that requires automatic generation of quality orders. For example, a quality order can be generated in the business processes for purchase orders, quarantine orders, sales orders, and production orders.

## Working with quality associations

The business process that uses a quality association can be related to various source documents, such as purchase orders, sales orders, or production orders.

Each quality association record defines the set of tests, the AQL, and the sampling plan that applies to the quality orders that are generated. You must define a quality association record for each variation in a business process. For example, you can set up a quality association that generates a quality order when a purchase order product receipt is updated. Depending on the setup of the execution plan, the triggering process itself can be blocked while there is an open quality order. Alternatively, subsequent processes, such as purchase order invoicing, can be blocked.

> [!NOTE]
> While there are open quality orders, inventory quantities are automatically blocked from being issued. Depending on the setting of the **Full blocking** field on the **Item samplings** page, the quantity is either the quantity on the quality order or the quantity on the source document line. For more information, see [Quality management item sampling](quality-item-sampling.md).

For a given business process, the quality association record identifies the event and conditions that a quality order is generated for. The conditions can be specific to either a site or a legal entity. A quality order that involves destructive tests can be generated only when on-hand inventory exists for the event.

To work with quality associations, go to **Inventory management \> Setup \> Quality control \> Quality associations**. The following examples show how a quality association record is defined for the variations in each business process. For each example, the following table summarizes the events and conditions that are defined by a quality association record.

> The *Quality management for warehouse processes* feature adds capabilities for quality order processing for production where the **Event type** field is set to *Report as finished* and the **Execution** field is set to *After*, and for purchases where the **Event type** field is set to *Registration*. For more information, see [Quality management for warehouse processes](quality-management-for-warehouses-processes.md).

## Examples of automatic generation of quality orders

### Purchasing

In purchasing, if you set the **Event type** field to *Product receipt* and the **Execution** field to *After* on the **Quality associations** page, you get the following results:

- If the **Per updated quantity** option is set to *Yes*, a quality order is generated for every receipt against the purchase order, based on the received quantity and settings in the item sampling. Every time that a quantity is received against the purchase order, new quality orders are generated based on the newly received quantity.
- If the **Per updated quantity** option is set to *No*, a quality order is generated for the first receipt against the purchase order, based on the received quantity. Additionally, one or more quality orders are created based on the remaining quantity, depending on the tracking dimensions. Quality orders aren't generated for subsequent receipts against the purchase order.

### Production

In production, if you set the **Event type** field to *Report as finished* and the **Execution** field to *After* on the **Quality associations** page, you get the following results:

- If the **Per updated quantity** option is set to *Yes*, a quality order is generated based on every finished quantity and settings in the item sampling. Every time that a quantity is reported as finished against the production order, new quality orders are generated based on the newly finished quantity. This generation logic is consistent with purchasing.
- If the **Per updated quantity** option is set to *No*, a quality order is generated the first time that a quantity is reported as finished, based on the finished quantity. Additionally, one or more quality orders are created based on the remaining quantity, depending on the tracking dimensions of the item sampling. Quality orders aren't generated for subsequent finished quantities.
