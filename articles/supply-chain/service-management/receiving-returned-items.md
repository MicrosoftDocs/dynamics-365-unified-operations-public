# Receiving returned items 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When a return shipment arrives, you match it to a return order that has already been created.

Depending on company policies, the items in the return shipment can be sent to quarantine for additional inspection or they can be returned to inventory.
