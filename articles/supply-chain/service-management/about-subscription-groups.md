# About subscription groups 




Subscriptions share the following information, which is defined for the subscription group:

  - Number sequence code for the subscription, if any.

  - The invoicing period for which subscription transactions are created. For example, if the **Invoicing** period code in the **Subscription groups** form is set to **Quarterly**, transactions for all subscriptions that are attached to the subscription group are created on a quarterly basis.

  - How frequently the subscription is to be accrued, if at all.

You can also complete the following tasks for all subscriptions that are attached to the subscription group:

  - Create subscription transactions.

  - Update the base price or the index for the subscriptions.

  - Post accrued revenue for subscription transactions.
