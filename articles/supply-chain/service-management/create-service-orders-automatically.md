# Create service orders automatically

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can create service orders for one service agreement or for several service agreements. When they're created, you can view your service orders on the **Service orders** page.

Service orders are created only for the valid period of the service agreement. If the interval that you specify on the **Create service orders** page is before the starting date or after the ending date of the service agreement, service orders are created only for the part of the interval that is within the service agreement dates.

When you create service orders manually or automatically from the service agreement line, the service order must be in the time interval that is defined by the starting and ending dates for the line, unless you don't specify an ending date on the line.

## Create service orders automatically for a service agreement

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Service agreements** \> **Service agreements**.
1. Select a service agreement.
1. On the Action Pane, select the **Deliver** tab, and then select **Planned service orders**.
1. Specify dates in the **From date** and **To date** fields to define the service period.
1. Set **Show Infolog** to *Yes* to generate an Action center message that displays a list of the service orders that are created.
1. Select transaction types in the **Include transaction types** field group. The transaction types represent the lines that are created in the service agreement, and each transaction type that you select generates several service orders, depending on the service interval that is specified on the service agreement line.
1. To create any service orders that are missing from continuous series of service orders, set **Continuous** to *Yes*.
1. Select **OK**.

## Create service orders automatically for several service agreements

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Periodic** \> **Service orders** \> **Create service orders**.
1. Select **Select** to make selections to add or remove criteria to use to create service orders.
1. Select **OK**.
