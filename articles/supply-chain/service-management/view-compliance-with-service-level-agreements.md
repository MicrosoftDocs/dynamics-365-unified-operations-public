# View compliance with service level agreements

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## View compliance with a service level agreement

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Service orders** \> **Service orders**. Open the details page for the order.

2. On the **General** tab, in the **Compliance** field, view the percentage of time that was spent on the service order compared to the time frame specified in the service level agreement.

> [!TIP]
> If the value in the **Compliance** field is larger than 100, the time limit of the service level agreement was exceeded.
