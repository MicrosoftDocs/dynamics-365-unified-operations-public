## View compliance with a service level agreement

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Service orders** \> **Service orders**. Select a service order and double-click to open the details form for the order.

2.  On the **General** tab, in the **Compliance** field, view the percentage of time that was spent on the service order compared to the time frame specified in the service level agreement.


> [!TIP]
> If the value in the <STRONG>Compliance</STRONG> field is larger than 100, the time limit of the service level agreement has been exceeded.
