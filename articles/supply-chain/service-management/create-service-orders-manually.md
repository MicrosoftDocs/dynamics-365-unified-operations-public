> <P>You can use automated processes to create service orders. 

## Create a service order manually from a service agreement

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Common** \> **Service agreements** \> **Service agreements**.

2.  Select a service agreement or create a new service agreement.

3.  Create service order lines for the service order.

> [!NOTE]
> <P>If the <STRONG>Allow without service agreement</STRONG> check box in the <STRONG>Service management parameters</STRONG> form is selected, you can post the transactions from the service order lines without attaching the service order to a service agreement.

If the check box is cleared, you must attach the manually created service order to a project before posting the service order lines.</P>
