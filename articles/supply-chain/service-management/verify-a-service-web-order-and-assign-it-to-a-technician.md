# Verify a service Web order and assign it to a technician 




When customers or service technicians submit a service order through Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, it is a good idea to review each order in the **Web service orders** form before you dispatch the orders. You can verify that the service orders are valid and determine which team or employee should handle each particular service order.

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Common** \> **Service orders** \> **Web service orders**. Select the Web service order, and then click **Edit** on the **Action Pane**.

2.  Review the details and make any necessary changes.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If the request is not valid, click <STRONG>Delete</STRONG> to cancel the service request.</P>



3.  Optional: On the **Address** FastTab, verify or update the address.

4.  Optional: Click **Repair lines** on the **Action Pane** to review repair lines that the customer may have created.

5.  After you verify the Web service order, click the **Dispatch** tab, and then click **Transfer** to move the order to the **Service orders** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>By default, the <STRONG>Service orders</STRONG> form only displays Web service orders that are transferred from the Web service orders list.</P>
