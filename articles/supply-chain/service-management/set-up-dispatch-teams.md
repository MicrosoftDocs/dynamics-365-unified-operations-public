# Set up dispatch teams

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to create a dispatch team. After you create a dispatch team, you can assign workers to the team. When you create a service order, you can then relate a member of a dispatch team to an activity in the service order.

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Dispatch teams**.

2. On the **Dispatch teams** page, select **New** to create a new team.

3. In the **Dispatch team** field, enter a unique name for the dispatch team.

4. In the **Owner** field, select the employee who is responsible for this team.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can select only employees in this field. You canâ€™t select vendors.

5. Optional: In the **Description** field, enter a brief description for this dispatch team.

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign a worker to this dispatch team on the **Worker** page. Learn more in [Set up a preferred technician](set-up-preferred-technician.md).
