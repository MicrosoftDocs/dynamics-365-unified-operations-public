# Set up dispatch teams 




This topic describes how to create a dispatch team. After you create a dispatch team, you can assign workers to the team. When you create a service order, you can then relate a member of a dispatch team to an activity in the service order.

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Dispatch teams**.

2.  In the **Dispatch teams** form, click **New** to create a new team.

3.  In the **Dispatch team** field, enter a unique name for the dispatch team.

4.  In the **Owner** field, select the employee who is responsible for this team.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can select only employees in this field. You can’t select vendors.</P>



5.  Optional: In the **Description** field, enter a brief description for this dispatch team.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can assign a worker to this dispatch team in the <STRONG>Worker</STRONG> form. For more information about how to assign a worker to a dispatch team, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn776288(v=ax.60)">Dispatch workers (form)</A>.</P>
