# Service agreements overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Service agreement groups are useful for sorting and filtering service agreements. Use service agreement groups to group service agreements by, for example, company size, geographical location, or industry type. Alternatively, you can use agreement groups to group service agreements by the level of service offered to a customer.

In the **Service agreement group** field in the **Service management parameters** page, you can define a default service agreement group. This group is suggested when you create a new service agreement.

## Example

-  You can group your service agreements according to the level of service offered. 
-  The three agreement groups you have set up in your company are Gold, Silver, and Bronze.
-  A new service account manager has been employed in your company. The service manager is responsible for dealing with all clients in the Gold agreement group. You can filter agreement records on the Gold agreement group to find all of the agreements for which you must specify the new service manager as the person in charge.
