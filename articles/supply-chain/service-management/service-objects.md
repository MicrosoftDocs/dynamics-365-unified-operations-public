# Service objects overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Service objects are a customer's assets and products for which you can perform a service. Depending on the type of service you provide, objects can be tangible or intangible:

- Tangible objects are things, such as a machine or a building, on which you can perform a physical service task.

    A tangible service object can also be an inventory item that you create on the Released product details page. Depending on the inventory dimension group that you attach to the item, you can create a service object to a level of detail that includes the item serial number. This is useful when you must keep track of the exact item that the service object represents.

    A tangible service object can also be an item that isn't directly related to a company's direct production or supply chain. For example, a tool kit that is used for repairs in a service order can be a service object that isn't included in inventory. In this case, you don't register it as an inventory item.

- Intangible objects are nonphysical things, such as a set of accounts or a legal document, on which you can perform a service task.

## Example of an intangible service object

Company A maintains the financial records for several small companies. One of Company A's clients is the local football team, for which Company A does the weekly bookkeeping and annual audit of the club's accounts. The club's accounts are set up on the Service objects page and specified as the object in the service agreement. There are two service agreement lines for the object. Line 1 is weekly bookkeeping with a weekly interval assigned to the line, and line 2 is the annual audit with a yearly interval assigned to it.
