# Create service agreement groups 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Service agreement groups are useful for sorting and filtering service agreements.

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service agreements** \> **Service agreement groups**.
2. Press **Alt+N** to create a new service agreement group.
3. In the **Service agreement group** field, enter an ID for the service agreement group.
4. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the service agreement group.
5. Close the page to save your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If a service agreement group is defined in the **Service agreement group** field of the **Service management parameters** page, the program suggests this group for all new service agreements that you create.
