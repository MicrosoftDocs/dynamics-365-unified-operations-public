# Indexed sales prices  

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


You set up the index for a subscription sales price when you create a subscription fee.

In the **Create subscription fee** form, set the **Get pricing from** field to **Indexed base price**, and then multiply the base price by the percentage in the **Percent price change** field to get the sales price of the subscription transaction.

For example, if the base price is EUR 1,000, and the index is 110, the sales price is EUR 1,100.
