# Monitor service activities 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


The **Dispatch board** form provides an at-a-glance status update for the various scheduled service activities, and tools for tracking the general flow of service orders in your company.


> [!TIP]
> <P>To view details about a service activity, select it in the Gantt chart at the top of the <STRONG>Dispatch board</STRONG> form, right-click, and then click <STRONG>Information</STRONG>.</P>


By using the tools in this form, you can sort service orders by date, priority, or type of service activity, view the priority levels that are assigned to service orders, and review which activities are assigned to individual service orders.

If you must redistribute service activity assignments, you can move the graphical representation of a service activity to assign it to a different employee or a different date and time.

## Example

While monitoring the day's service activity, you notice that John, a service technician, is running behind schedule on assigned service calls. You also notice that the last call in his list must be completed by the end of the day to meet service level agreement requirements. By using the drag-and-drop functionality of the Gantt chart, you can reassign that service call to Meg, who has completed her own service calls ahead of schedule.

## Open the Dispatch board form

Click **Service management** \> **Periodic** \> **Dispatch board**.
