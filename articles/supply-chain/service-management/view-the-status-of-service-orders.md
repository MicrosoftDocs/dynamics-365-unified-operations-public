You can use the **Dispatch board** form to view the status of service activities in service orders.

## More information about service orders

The form also provides tools to track the flow of service orders and includes additional details to help you evaluate the urgency of a service order, such the service agreement and service level agreement that it is associated with.

In order to help you quickly gauge the urgency of a service order, the Gantt chart supports the use of colors. Colors are used to distinguish the priority of a service call. By default, these colors are red for high priority, yellow for typical priority, and green for low priority.


> [!TIP]
> <P>You can change the colors on the <STRONG>Dispatching</STRONG> tab in the <STRONG>Service management parameters</STRONG> form.</P>
