Service interval indicates the frequency with which service order lines are created for service agreement lines when you create service orders.

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service agreements** \> **Service intervals**.
2. Create a new service interval.
3. Enter the ID and description of the service interval.
4. In the **Range** field, select the range.
5. In the **Frequency** field, type the frequency. The frequency is the factor by which you must multiply the range to obtain the interval for a service agreement.
6. Press **Alt+S** to save the service interval.
