    Click **Inventory management** \> **Journals** \> **Item arrival** \> **Production input**.

2.  On the **Location journal** form, register the receipt of an item as usual.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For information about registering the receipt of returned items, see <A href="register-the-receipt-of-returned-items.md">Register the receipt of returned items</A></P>



3.  On the **Default values** tab, in the **Mode of handling** area, select the **Quarantine management** box.

This will prompt the system to create a quarantine order, and the person or department that performs inspections will respond to this order using the **Quarantine order** form.
