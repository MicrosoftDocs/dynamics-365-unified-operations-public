# Reassign activities 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article describes how to reassign service activities from one worker to another worker. You can reassign service activities from one worker to another worker even if those workers are assigned to different dispatch teams.

Use the following steps to reassign an activity to another worker:

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Periodic** \> **Dispatch board**.

2.  In the **From date** and **To date** fields, enter dates to define the time period to view activities for.

3.  Select whether to view closed activities and dispatch information for related teams, and then click **OK**.

4.  In the **Dispatch board** form, click **Advanced** to display only the Gantt chart at the top of the page. Click **Simple** to display the Gantt chart and the tabs in the form.

5.  Expand each dispatch team list.

6.  Use either of the following steps to reassign an activity:
    
      - Select a color-coded graphic that represents the service activity to reassign. Press the SHIFT key, and then move the color-coded graphic to the row for another employee.
    
      - On the **All** tab, **Team** tab, **Undispatched** tab, or **Related** tab, in the **Worker** field, enter the name of the worker who is replacing the current worker for the activity.
