# Set up service order stages

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service orders** \> **Service stages**.

2. Select **New** to create a new record.

3. In the **Service stage** and **Description** fields, specify a service stage ID and description.

4. Select the appropriate parameters for the stage.

5. Select the parent stage for the current stage or leave the **Parent** field blank if the stage is the initial stage in the stage setup.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot modify the **Parent** field after you save the stage. Instead, you can delete the record and create the record again with a different selection in the **Parent** field.
>
> Also, you can only create one stage with a blank **Parent** field. That is, only one initial stage is permitted.
