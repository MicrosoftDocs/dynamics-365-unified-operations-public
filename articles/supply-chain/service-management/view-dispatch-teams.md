Service orders in the **Dispatch board** form are grouped by dispatch team.

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Periodic** \> **Dispatch board**.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Adjust view settings**.

1. The **Adjust view settings** dialog opens. Select a date range, and then select **OK**.

1. On the **Dispatch board** page, in the Gantt chart at the top of the page, expand a team list to review the names of the workers on the team. You can also view details about the service activities that are assigned to each worker.

For information about how to assign a worker to a team, see [Set up a preferred technician](set-up-preferred-technician.md).
