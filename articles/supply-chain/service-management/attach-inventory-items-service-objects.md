# Attach inventory items to service objects

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to attach an inventory item to a service object. When you attach an item to a service object, you can control and report the service activities that are performed for the item.

Before you can attach items to service objects, you must create the items on the **Released product details** page.

Use the following steps to attach an inventory item to a service object:

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service objects** \> **Service objects**.

2. In the **Item number** field, select the item to attach to the service object.

3. Save the service object.

The item is now attached to the service object, and any inventory dimensions specified for the item are also copied to the service object.
