# About the dispatch board 




A dispatch board is the central location from which you can view the status of activities in a service order. You can perform the following tasks in a dispatch board:

  - Filter and view service activities in a certain date range.

  - Identify the priority of a service activity, and distinguish among service priority levels based on a color scheme that you set up.

  - Review the workers that are assigned to a dispatch team.

  - Modify the service times and assigned technicians for a service activity.

  - Review the list of service activities that have not been dispatched.

For information about how to perform specific tasks in a dispatch board, see the topics in the **See also** section.
