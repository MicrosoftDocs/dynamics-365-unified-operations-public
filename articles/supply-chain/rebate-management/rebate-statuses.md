# Rebate statuses

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Rebate statuses help you to track the status of each Rebate management deal. You can also use them for reporting and inquiry purposes. You can set up and name as many rebate status values as you require to support your business process. 

To set up rebate statuses, go to **Rebate management \> Setup \> Status \> Status**. Then use the buttons on the Action Pane to add and remove status values as required. For each status, set the following fields:

- **Rebate status** – Enter a name for the status (such as *Negotiating*, *Agreed*, or *Completed*).
- **Description** – Enter a description of the status to provide more information about how it should be used.

On the [**Rebate management parameters** page](rebate-management-parameters.md), you can select a default status. That status will then be assigned to all new Rebate management deals that are created.
