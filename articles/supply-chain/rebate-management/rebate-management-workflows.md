# Rebate management deal workflows

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

To approve rebate deals, Rebate management uses the same workflow platform as other Finance and Operations apps. Two job processes are associated with every workflow:

- One element of the workflow approves the deal.
- One element of the workflow activates the deal so that the user or workflow process can approve the transactions.

Before you can use a rebate deal, it must be active in the **Rebate management** module. To activate a deal, you must first create and configure a *Rebate management deal workflow*.

Users can't manually approve deals. The workflow must always be used.

## Create and manage Rebate management deal workflows

To work with your Rebate management deal workflows, go to **Rebate management \> Setup \> Rebate management workflows**. There, you can view, create, and update workflows as required. Only one workflow of this type can be active at a time. For more information about workflows, how to work with the **Rebate management workflows** page, and how to create workflows, see [Workflow system overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/overview-workflow-system.md) and its related topics.

## Use a workflow to activate a deal

To activate a deal through a workflow, open the deal (for example, on the **All rebate management deals** page). Then, on the Action Pane, select **Workflow \> Submit**. After the new deal has been processed and approved through the workflow, it will be active and ready to use.

After a deal has been activated, you can't change most of its setup. If you must change an active deal, first inactivate it, and then create a new deal. If the new deal will resemble the old deal, you can create it by copying the old deal.

You can change the following settings for a deal after it has been activated:

- Reconcile by
- Cumulative guarantee
- Posting profile
- Posting profile for guarantee
- Document notes
- Currency
- From date
- To date

In addition, rebate lines can be removed.
