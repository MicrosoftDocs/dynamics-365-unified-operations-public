# Rebate management groups

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Rebate management calculations can be driven by groups. Rebate management groups can be created for customers, vendors, and items. They can be attached to a master record.

The calculation for a group of customers is often created for a chain of companies, such as a supermarket chain or a franchise company. This type of calculation is usually related to a rebate.
