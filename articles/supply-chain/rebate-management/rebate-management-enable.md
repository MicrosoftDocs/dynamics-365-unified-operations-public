To use this feature, it must be turned on for your system. As of Supply Chain Management version 10.0.32, it's turned on by default. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on as needed. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Shared AP and AR*
- **Feature name:** *Rebate management*
