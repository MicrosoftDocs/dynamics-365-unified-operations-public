## Prerequisites

To use the **Pricing management** module, you must be running Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.33 or later.

## Feature management

Before you can use the **Pricing management** module, it must be turned on for your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on as required. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Sales and marketing*
- **Feature name:** *(Preview) Pricing management*
