# Missing field settings when item model groups are copied to another legal entity

KB number: 4612800

## Symptoms

When you copy item model groups to another legal entity (company) by using the *Item model group inventory policies* entity, some field settings (for example, the inventory model and description) are missing in the new model group in the destination legal entity.

## Resolution

To create a complete copy of an item model group to another legal entity, you must also select both the item model group inventory policies (`InventInventoryPolicyEntity`) and the cost flow assumption policies (`InventCostFlowAssumptionPolicyEntity`) that are associated with the item model group.
