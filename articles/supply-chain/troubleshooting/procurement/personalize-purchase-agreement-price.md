# You can't add the Price unit field to the Purchase agreement page

## Symptoms

When you open the **Purchase agreement** page in a line view mode, you can't personalize the page by adding the **Price unit** field in the overview of the line.

## Resolution

Some shared fields in the agreement framework can't be included in personalizations. This limitation occurs because of the data model that is implemented. Therefore, you can't personalize the **Price unit** field.
