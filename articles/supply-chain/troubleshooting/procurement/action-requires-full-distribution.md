# You can only complete a purchase order action for fully distributed line numbers

## Symptom

You can only complete an action on a purchase after the line number is fully distributed.

## Cause

This issue can occur because of inconsistency in purchase order distributions.

## Resolution

To unblock this issue and reset the purchase order to a *Draft* state, go to **Procurement and sourcing \> Periodic tasks \> Clean up \> Purchase order distribution reset**.
