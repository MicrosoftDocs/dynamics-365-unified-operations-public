# Packing station doesn't show product notes

KB number: 4614615

## Symptoms

Packing notes aren't shown in the packing form when the packing instructions are added as an attachment to a product master or a product variant.

## Resolution

The system is behaving as designed.

The current logic for showing packing notes in the packing form requires that the notes be associated with the shipments.
