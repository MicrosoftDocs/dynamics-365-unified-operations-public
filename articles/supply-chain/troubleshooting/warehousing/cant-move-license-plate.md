# Can't move license plate if serial number has Blank issue and Blank receipt allowed

## Symptoms

You can't move a license plate by using a **Movement** menu item if the serial number has settings of *Blank issue allowed* and *Blank receipt allowed* on the tracking dimension group, and if there are multiple license plates in the same location, some of which have serial numbers and some of which don't.

## Resolution

This issue will be fixed by changes that are deployed in [KB 4571546](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Details?kb=4571546&bugId=467880&dbType=3&qc=5b46d7faa9cc326cebfe9854cb30be8ea30b21ef33d3572c325fbb21202de687). Those changes will make the **Serial number** field optional when Blank receipt and Blank issue are allowed.
