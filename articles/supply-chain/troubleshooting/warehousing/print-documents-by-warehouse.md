# Print a delivery note or packing content by warehouse or site

## Symptoms

You want to print a delivery note or packing content by warehouse or site on the **Work audit template line update** page.

## Resolution

When you print a document by using Print management settings, limit the scope (site/warehouse) through Print management instead of selecting **Edit print settings** on the **Work audit template line update** page.
