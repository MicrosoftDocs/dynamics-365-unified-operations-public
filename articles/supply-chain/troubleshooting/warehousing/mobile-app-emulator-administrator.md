# Can only use administrator role to access the mobile device app emulator

## Symptoms

When setting up warehouses in Supply Chain Management, you can't use any role except the administrator role to access the mobile device app emulator.

## Resolution

The mobile device app emulator is set to work only with the administrator account. For all testing and live process purposes, we recommend that you use the Warehouse Management mobile app itself.
