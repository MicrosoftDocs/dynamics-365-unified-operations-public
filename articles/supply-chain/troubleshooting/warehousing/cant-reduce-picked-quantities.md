# Can't move inventory to a location that is license plate-controlled

## Symptoms

You can't reduce picked quantities on a load.

## Resolution

In earlier versions, you couldn't reduce picked quantities on a load. However, you can now unpick to a license plate-controlled location. You must specify both a **Location** value and a **License plate** value for the load line on the **Reduce picked quantity** page.
