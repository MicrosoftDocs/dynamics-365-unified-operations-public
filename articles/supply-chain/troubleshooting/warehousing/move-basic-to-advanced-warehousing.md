# Issues moving from basic warehousing to advanced warehousing

## Symptoms

You're currently running under stock/inventory management and using basic stock functionality, and you want to move to advanced warehousing to take advantage of mobile devices, waves, and work. However, you're experiencing issues when you try to make this move.

For example, you can't change your products so that they use storage dimensions (site, warehouse, and location) because the products have transactions against them. Therefore, you need to learn the approved process for moving from basic warehousing to advanced warehousing.
