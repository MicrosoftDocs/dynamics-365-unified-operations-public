# Purchase orders don't show translated product text

KB number: 4612098

## Symptoms

You've defined text translations for product names. However, product names are always shown in the original language, regardless of the language setting in the app.

## Resolution

Product translations are shown only on external-facing documents. They aren't shown to internal users. For more information, see [Product-related translations FAQ](../../pim/translations-product-related-information.md#where-can-i-view-the-translated-information).
