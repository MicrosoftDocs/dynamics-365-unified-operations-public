# Picking list report doesn't show new notes that are attached to a journal

KB number: 4611660

## Symptoms

The picking list report doesn't show new notes that are attached to a picking list journal.

## Resolution

The pickling list report shows only notes that are attached on the sales order line and the sales order header. It doesn't show any new notes that are added in the invoice journal.
