# Introduction to work orders

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]



Work orders are used to manage maintenance jobs, provide required information for them, and register consumption on them. Each work order can contain one or more work order jobs, and one or more assets can be connected to each work order. Each work order job defines a maintenance job that is scheduled on the asset.

Work orders can be created in the following ways:

- For  calendar-based maintenance plans where the "Auto create" setting is turned on, automatically by using [Schedule maintenance plans](../preventive-and-reactive-maintenance/schedule-maintenance-plans.md).

- For maintenance rounds where the "Auto create" setting is turned on, automatically by using [Schedule maintenance rounds](../preventive-and-reactive-maintenance/maintenance-rounds.md).

- For preventive maintenance jobs or maintenance requests, from [Maintenance schedule](../preventive-and-reactive-maintenance/maintenance-schedule.md).

- Manually

- From the **All maintenance requests**, **Active maintenance requests**, or **My functional location maintenance requests** page.

>[!NOTE]
>Work order jobs that are related to the same asset are related to the same project ID.

## All work orders

Select **Asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **All work orders** to open the **All work orders** list page. This page shows all work orders and some of the information that is related to each.

The illustration below shows an example of the **All work orders** list page.

![Figure 1](media/01-work-orders.png)

To view a list of only active work orders, select **Asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **Active work orders**. 

To view a list of work order jobs that contain assets that are installed on functional locations that you're related to as a worker, select **Asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **My functional location work order maintenance jobs**. (The relation between workers and functional locations is set up on the **Workers** page. For more information, see [Maintenance workers and worker groups](../setup-for-objects/workers-and-worker-groups.md).)

Here are some ways that you can use the **All work orders** page:

- In the grid view, select a link in the **Work order** column to show the details view for the selected record. You can then select **Edit** to open the record for editing.

- In the details view, you view detailed information that is related to the work order.  

- In the details view, select the **Lines** tab to view details of the work order job, or select the **Header** tab to view details of the work order.  

- Expand the **Related information** pane on the right side of the page to view additional information that is related to the selected work order.

The illustration below shows an example of the **All work orders** details view.

The buttons on the Action Pane are organized on tabs. The following table briefly describes the buttons that are related to Asset Management:
