[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 

In Asset Management, you can generate two reports that are related to maintenance requests. One report shows details, and the other report provides a list that can be used for planning and follow-up.

## Create a Maintenance request details report

The **Maintenance request details** report shows various information that is related to maintenance requests.

1. Select **Asset management** \> **Reports** \> **Maintenance requests** \> **Maintenance request details**.
2. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can select specific maintenance requests to include on the report.
3. On the **Run in the background** FastTab, you can set up report generation as a batch job, as you require.
4. Select **OK** to generate the report.

The following illustration shows an example of the **Maintenance request details** report.

## Create a Maintenance request list report

The **Maintenance request list** report shows a list of all maintenance requests of the same request type.

1. Select **Asset management** \> **Reports** \> **Maintenance requests** \> **Maintenance request list**.
2. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can make selections to define which maintenance requests are included on the report.
3. On the **Run in the background** FastTab, you can set up report generation as a batch job, as you require.
4. Select **OK** to generate the report.
