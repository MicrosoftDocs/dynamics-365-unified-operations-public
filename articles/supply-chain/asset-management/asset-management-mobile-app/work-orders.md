[!INCLUDE [azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](../../../includes/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Maintenance workers can use the Asset Management mobile app to manage and process maintenance work orders. The app supports maintenance workers through the following main capabilities:

- It lists maintenance jobs and work orders that are assigned to a worker, including all information that the worker needs to process each job.
- Workers can register the time and spare parts that are consumed for each job.
- Workers can view and update the maintenance checklist that's associated with a job.

For more information about maintenance work orders in Supply Chain Management, see [Introduction to work orders](../work-orders/introduction-to-work-orders.md).

## User requirements

To view and process work orders by using the Asset Management mobile app, you must meet the following requirements:

- Your user account in Supply Chain Management must be assigned the *Maintenance worker* security role. For more information, see [Onboard the Asset Management mobile app](onboard-app.md).
- Your user account in Supply Chain Management must be associated with a human resources *Worker* record that's also set up as an Asset Management worker. For more information, see [Onboard the Asset Management mobile app](onboard-app.md).
- You must sign in to Power Apps by using a domain account that matches a user account in Supply Chain Management that has the same Microsoft Entra ID username.

## View the jobs and work orders assigned to you

When you open the Asset Maintenance mobile app and sign in as a user who has the *Maintenance worker* security role, the list of jobs and work orders is shown.

The following illustration highlights the different user interface (UI) elements for working with maintenance work orders.

If your Supply Chain Management user account is set up as an Asset Management worker in more than one legal entity, you can select this label to switch between legal entities.
1. **Request button** – If your Supply Chain Management user account is assigned the *Maintenance requester* security role, you can use this button to create a maintenance request.

When you select a product that will be consumed, you can specify storage dimensions (site, warehouse, and location) and tracking dimensions (batch and serial number) as required. Items that have product variants (such as configuration, color, and size) aren't listed.
