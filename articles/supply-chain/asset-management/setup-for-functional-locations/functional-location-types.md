# Functional location types

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 

This topic describes how to create functional location types in Asset Management. Functional location types are used to manage requirements for functional locations, including how assets are installed on a functional location. You can set up asset types, maintenance plans, functional location attributes, and asset attribute requirements to be used on a functional location that uses the specific functional location type. When you create a functional location, the functional location type is mandatory.

>[!NOTE] 
>In order to work with functional locations, you must create a default functional location to be used only for the purpose of creating new assets. For that default functional location, you should create a default functional location type that is really simple and allows multiple assets to be installed on the default functional location. See [Create functional locations](../functional-locations/create-functional-locations.md) for more information on how to set up functional locations.

## Create a default functional location type

This procedure shows how to create a default functional location type to be used for a default functional location.

1. Select **Asset management** > **Setup** > **Functional locations** > **Functional location types**.
2. Select **New** to create a functional location type.
3. Insert a functional location type ID in the **Functional location type** field, for example, "Default", and a name in the **Name** field.
4. Select a lifecycle model in the **Functional location lifecycle model** field.
5. Select "Yes" on the **Multiple assets** toggle button to allow more assets to be installed on a functional location (the default functional location) using this type.

Now, the default functional location type to be used only on a default functional location is created. You should not add any more requirements or restrictions to this default functional location type.


## Create Functional Location Types

1. Select **Asset Management** > **Setup** > **Functional locations** > **Functional location types**.
2. Select **New** to create a functional location type.
3. Insert a functional location type ID in the **Functional location type** field and a name in the **Name** field.
4. Select a lifecycle model in the **Functional location lifecycle model** field. Refer to [Functional location lifecycle states](../setup-for-functional-locations/functional-location-stages.md) for more information on functional location lifecycle states and lifecycle models.
5. Select "Yes" on the **Multiple assets** toggle button if it should be possible to install several assets on a functional location using this functional location type. If you select "No", you can only install *one* asset on a functional location using this functional location type.
6. Select "Yes" on the **Update asset dimension** toggle button if you want assets installed on a functional location of this type to automatically use the financial dimensions related to the functional location. This means that if you change financial dimensions in the [Create functional locations](../functional-locations/create-functional-locations.md) form, and the functional location uses a functional location type with this toggle button set to "Yes", financial dimensions are automatically updated on all assets installed on that functional location.
7. The **Asset type** field is used if you want to automatically create *one* asset for the functional location with the same ID and name as the functional location you are creating. For example, this may be relevant if you create a static functional location, such as a building or a pipeline. In that case, select the asset type you want to use for the automatically created asset. Remember that if you make a selection in this field, the **Multiple assets** toggle button must be set to "No".
8. On the **Asset types** FastTab, select the asset types to be related to the functional location type. Select **Add line** and select the asset types. If you add asset types here, only assets using those asset types can be installed on a functional location using this functional location type. If no asset types are selected on the **Asset types** FastTab, all asset types may be installed.
9. On the **Maintenance plans** FastTab, select the maintenance plans that should automatically be set up on new functional locations using this functional location type. Select **Add line** and select the maintenance plans. If you add maintenance plans here, only those plans can be used on a functional location using this functional location type.
10. On the **Asset attribute requirements** FastTab, set up the asset attributes that should automatically be set up on new functional locations using this functional location type. Select **Add line** and select the attribute. These attribute requirements function as guidelines. They are not validated against attributes set up on an asset (**Asset management** > **Common** > **Assets** > **All assets** > select asset in the list page > **General** tab > **Attributes** button). The attribute requirements are shown when you install assets on functional locations.
11. On the **Permitted types** FastTab, select the functional location types that should be valid for sub functional location types related to a parent functional location type, which uses the selected functional location type.
12. On the **Attributes** FastTab, select the functional location attributes that should automatically be set up on functional locations using this functional location type. Select **Add line** and select the attribute.


>[!NOTE] 
>On the **General** FastTab, you can get an overview of the number of asset types, maintenance plans, asset attribute requirements, permitted types, attributes, and functional locations set up on the functional location type. The **Functional locations** field shows the number of functional locations that use the functional location type. You can use the **Copy** button to copy settings from a functional location type to the selected functional location type.
