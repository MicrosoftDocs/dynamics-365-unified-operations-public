# Work hour control

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 

In Asset Management, you can calculate hours to get an overview of actual hours compared to budget hours on assets, functional locations, or work orders. Actual hours are based on posted transactions.

## Work hour control for assets, functional locations, and work orders

The calculations made for assets, functional locations, and work orders are almost identical. Only difference is that for assets and functional locations, you can also include sub assets and sub locations in your calculation. The date is the transaction date when the registration was recorded.

1. Click **Asset management** > **Inquiries** > **Assets** > **Asset hour control** or **Functional location hour control**, or **Asset management** > **Inquiries** > **Work orders** > **Work order hour control**.

2. In the **Asset hour control** dialog, .

3. In the **Asset hour control** / **Functional location hour control** / **Work order hour control** dialog, select a period to be calculated in the **From date** and **To date** fields.

4. If required, select a **Financial dimension set** to be included in the calculation.

5. Select "Yes" on the **Skip zero** toggle button if you don't want to show results containing zero hours.

6. You can use the **Level** field to indicate how detailed you want the hour control lines to be regarding functional locations. 

    For example, if you insert the number "1" in the field, and you have a multi-level functional location hierarchy, all hour control lines for a functional location will be shown on the top level, and therefore the hours on a line may be added up from functional locations located at a lower level. 
    
    If you insert the number "0" in the **Level** field, you will see a detailed result showing all hour control lines on all the functional location levels to which they are related.

7. Select "Yes" on the **Include sub assets** toggle button to show costs related to sub assets as separate lines.

8. If you want to limit the search, you can select specific assets / functional locations / work orders on the **Records to include** FastTab.

9. Click **OK** to start the calculation.

10. On the **Asset hour control** page, click the **Group by** buttons to show the required detail level of the calculation. The selected **Group by** buttons are highlighted. Click on a button to activate or deactivate it.

## Example

The screenshot below shows an example of an **Asset hour control** calculation.

- The **Original budget** field shows budget hours from the work order forecast. 
- The **Actual hours** field shows posted hours on work orders. 
- The **Committed hours** field shows total amount of hours that your company is committed to in relation to work orders.

Another way of making an hour calculation is to multi-select assets in **All assets** or **Active assets**. Then you click the **Hour control** button on the **General** FastTab. The selected assets are automatically inserted in the **Asset** field on the **Records to include** FastTab. Click **OK** in the **Asset hour control** dialog, and the calculation for the selected assets is shown. The same procedure can be done for functional locations in **All functional locations** or **Active functional locations**, and for work orders in **All work orders** or **Active work orders**.
