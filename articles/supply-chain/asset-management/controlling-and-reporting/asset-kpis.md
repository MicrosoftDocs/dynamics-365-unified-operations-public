# Asset KPIs

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 

In Asset Management, you can calculate various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for assets and asset types. You use KPIs to get an overview of performance on assets in relation to, for example, uptime, downtime, repair time, and Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF).

1. Click **Asset management** > **Inquiries** > **Assets** > **Asset KPIs**.

2. In the **Calculate asset KPIs** dialog, you select the **Time scale** to be used in the calcualtion, and a period in the **From date** and **To date** fields. 

3. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can select specific assets and asset types to be included in the calculation, if required.

4. Click **OK** to start the calculation.

5. On the **Overview** FastTab, the results of the calculation are displayed in grid view. Each asset is displayed on a separate line.

6. On the **KPIs for selected line** FastTab, you see calculations for the asset selected on the **Overview** FastTab. The KPI values are categorized regarding **Time**, **Availability**, **Work orders**, **Maintenance**, **Faults**, **Maintenance downtime**, and **Cost**.

In the table below, you'll find a description of the fields on the **Asset KPIs** page.

| MTPS                    | Mean Time Production Stops, which is maintenance downtime divided by number of maintenance downtime registrations. If number of maintenance downtime registrations is zero in the selected period, the MTPS value is set to zero.                                                                               |
