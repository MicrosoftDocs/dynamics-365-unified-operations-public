# Maintenance requests

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 

You can set up various types of requests to use in your company. Maintenance requests are one type. Maintenance requests are used to request that a work order be required for a specific job. A maintenance request can be created by any user who has access to Asset Management functionality. A planner or manager can then decide whether a maintenance request should be converted to a work order, or whether it should complete its own lifecycle.

## View maintenance requests

- Select **Asset management** \> **Common** \> **Maintenance requests** \> **All maintenance requests** or **Active maintenance requests**.

    The **All maintenance requests** list page shows all maintenance requests, regardless of their lifecycle state. The **Active maintenance requests** lists page shows only maintenance requests that are in an active state.

The following illustration shows an example of the **All maintenance requests** list page.
