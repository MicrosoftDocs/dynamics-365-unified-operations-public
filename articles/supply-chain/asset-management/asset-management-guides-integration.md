# Integrate Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management (Asset management) with Dynamics 365 Guides

You can integrate the **Asset management** module in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management with Dynamics 365 Guides to take advantage of mixed-reality guides in your day-to-day service and maintenance workflows. If a guide is associated with an Asset Management work order, a worker who opens the work order's maintenance checklist in the Supply Chain Management (Dynamics 365) mobile app sees that a guide is available. The worker can then find and open the guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app.

## Prerequisites

Before you can attach guides to Asset management work orders, you must complete these prerequisites:

- [Set up Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/index.md) version 10.0.9 or later.
- [Turn on dual-write for Supply Chain Management apps](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/enable-dual-write.md).
- [Turn on flight](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md#features-flighted-in-data-management-and-enabling-flighted-features) for the **MRGuidesFeature** feature. (For production environments, you must first submit a support ticket to have your tenant added to the flighting group.)
- [Turn on the following configuration keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/license-code-and-configuration-key-reference) on the **License configuration** page:

    - Asset management \> Asset management mixed reality
    - Mixed reality \> Mixed reality guide

- [Set up Dynamics 365 Guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/setup#step-2-create-a-common-data-service-environment-and-install-the-dynamics-365-guides-solution) version 200.0.0.96 or later.

## Use Dynamics 365 Guides with Asset management

To associate a guide, you use a maintenance checklist line in Asset management. You can create the association through a maintenance checklist template, a maintenance job type, or a work order, because all three contain maintenance checklist lines. You can save time by using a template, because a template can be associated with all the maintenance job types that use it. For example, a guide that is associated with a maintenance job type is automatically associated with all work orders that specify that job type. On the other hand, a guide that is associated directly with a work order exists only for that work order.

### Associate a guide with a maintenance checklist template

To associate a guide with a maintenance checklist template, follow these steps.

1. Create a guide by using the Dynamics 365 Guides PC and HoloLens apps. For information about how to create a guide, see the following topics:

    - [Use the PC app to create a guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-app-overview)
    - [Use the HoloLens app to place your holograms](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/hololens-app-overview)

1. In Supply Chain Management, [create a maintenance checklist template](setup-for-work-orders/job-groups-and-job-types-variants-trades-and-checklists.md#create-a-maintenance-checklist-template).
1. Associate the guide that you created with a maintenance checklist line in the new maintenance checklist template:

    1. On the **Maintenance checklist lines** FastTab, select the line that you want to associate the guide with.
    1. On the **Associated guides** FastTab, select **Add Guide**.

        ![Associate a guide with a maintenance checklist line](media/am-guides-integration-add-guide.png "Associate a guide with a maintenance checklist line")

    1. In the **Name** field, select a guide, and then select **Save**.

        ![Select a guide in the Name field](media/am-guides-integration-select-guide.png "Select a guide in the Name field")

1. Associate the maintenance checklist template with a job type:

    1. [Create a maintenance job type](setup-for-work-orders/job-groups-and-job-types-variants-trades-and-checklists.md#create-a-maintenance-job-type), or select an existing maintenance job type.
    1. On the Action Pane, select **Maintenance job type defaults**.

        ![Maintenance job type defaults button](media/am-guides-integration-job-defaults.png "Maintenance job type defaults button")

    1. Create a line, and then select **Save**.

        ![Create a line](media/am-guides-integration-add-line.png "Create a line")

    1. On the Action Pane, select **Maintenance checklist**.

        ![Maintenance checklist button](media/am-guides-integration-maintenance-checklist.png "Maintenance checklist button")

    1. On the **Maintenance checklist lines** FastTab, add a line, and then change the value of the **Type** field to **Template**.

        ![Change the Type value](media/am-guides-integration-checklist-lines.png "Change the Type value")

    1. On the **Line details** FastTab, in the **Template** field, select the template that you associated the guide with, and then select **Save**.

        ![Select the template](media/am-guides-integration-checklist-line-details.png "Select the template")

1. [Create a work order](work-orders/manually-created-workorders.md#create-work-order), and then select the maintenance job type that uses the maintenance checklist template that you associated the guide with. The guide is automatically associated with the work order.

    ![Select a maintenance job type](media/am-guides-integration-create-work-order.png "Select a maintenance job type")

1. View the guide that is associated with the work order and workers:

    1. Open the [Asset management mobile workspace](asset-management-mobile-workspace.md) to access the work order.
    1. [Open the maintenance checklist](asset-management-mobile-workspace.md#view-maintenance-checklist-on-a-work-order-job) for the work order.
    1. Select a checklist line to see the associated guide.

        ![Guide associated with a checklist line](media/am-guides-integration-show-guide.png "Guide associated with a checklist line")

    1. Open the guide on HoloLens.

        ![Open the guide on HoloLens](media/am-guides-integration-hololens-select.png "Open the guide on HoloLens")

> [!NOTE]
> You can also associate a guide directly in the maintenance checklist of a work order or a job type.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a known issue where, when you associate a maintenance checklist template with a default maintenance job type, the guide that is linked to the template doesn't appear on the **Associated guides** FastTab of the **Maintenance job type defaults** page. However, the guide will appear after that job type is applied to a work order on the **Associated guides** FastTab.
