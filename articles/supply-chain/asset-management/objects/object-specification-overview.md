# Asset attribute overview

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 

This article provides an overview of asset attributes in Asset Management. Asset attributes are properties that are related to an asset type or an asset. If you've set up [attribute types](../setup-for-functional-locations/specification-types.md) and used them on assets, you can get an overview of the attribute values that are set up on the assets. This overview is shown on two pages in Asset Management: **Asset attribute overview** and **Asset attribute**.

The **Asset attribute overview** page shows a separate line for each asset. The line shows all attribute types that are related to that asset. Follow these steps to open and use the **Asset attribute overview** page.

1. Select **Asset management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Assets** \> **Asset attribute overview**.
2. In the **Asset type** field, select an asset type.
3. Select **OK**. A list shows all the assets that use the selected asset type. For each asset, all related asset attribute types are shown on the same line.

The **Asset attribute** page shows a separate line for each attribute type that is used on an asset. To open this page, select **Asset management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Assets** \> **Asset attribute**.
