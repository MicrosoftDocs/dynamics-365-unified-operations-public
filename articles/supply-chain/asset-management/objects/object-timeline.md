This topic explains how to access asset event history in Asset Management. The **Asset event history** page shows the registration history that has been made during the lifetime of an asset. You can access this page from the **All assets**, **Active assets**, and **My active assets** menu items. Select an asset, and then select **Event history**.

On the **Details** FastTab of the **Asset event history** page, you can do a search on all the available information. For example, you can use the asset event history to find the following information:

- When a job type was last used on an asset
- When a specific worker entered a remark on a work order job

The timeline is updated every time that the page is opened. It contains the following information:

- Changes that have been made on the asset: asset location, asset ID, name, and vendor warranty
- Asset parent
- Asset bill of materials (BOM)
- Asset lifecycle state log
- Functional location
- Maintenance requests
- Work orders, including posted item and notes
- Faults
- Condition assessments
