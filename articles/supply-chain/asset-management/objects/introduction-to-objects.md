# Introduction to assets

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 

This topic provides an overview of assets in Asset Management. An *asset* is any type of equipment, such as a machine or a machine part, that requires maintenance, service, or repair.

An asset is automatically updated with related information. For example, this related information might be about new or updated work orders. You can create assets by using either the **All assets** menu item or the **Pending assets** menu item. This topic explains how to create assets by using the **All assets** menu item. For information about how to create assets by using the **Pending assets** menu item, see [Create assets based on purchase orders](../objects/create-objects-based-on-purchase-orders.md).

## All assets

Select **Asset management** \> **Common** \> **Assets** \> **All assets**. The **All assets** list page shows all assets and some of the information that is related to them. To view only active assets, select **Active assets**. To view only assets that are installed on the functional locations that you're related to as a maintenance worker, select **My active assets**. (This relation is set up on the **Workers** page. For more information, see [Maintenance workers and worker groups](../setup-for-objects/workers-and-worker-groups.md).)

In the **All assets** grid view, select a link in the **Asset** column to view the details of the selected record. To edit the record, select the **Edit** button. The details view shows detailed information that is related to the asset. A **Related information** pane on the right contains additional asset-related information. Expand the pane to show the related information for the selected asset.

The buttons on the Action Pane are organized on tabs. The following table briefly describes the buttons that are related to Asset Management.
