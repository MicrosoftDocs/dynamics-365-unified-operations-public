# Set up the Asset management mobile workspace

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to set up Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and the Finance and Operations (Dynamics 365) mobile app to run an **Asset management** mobile workspace that workers can use to perform asset management tasks.

## Set up maintenance worker users in Supply Chain Management

For each user that requires access to the **Asset management** mobile workspace, follow these steps.

1. In Supply Chain Management, go to **Human resources \> Workers**, and make sure that a worker record exists for the user that you want to set up. Create a new worker record as required.
1. Go to **Asset management \> Setup \> Workers \> Workers**, and make sure that the worker record that you identified (or created) in the previous step is mapped to a maintenance worker record. Create a new maintenance worker record as required, and set the **Worker** field to the worker record from the previous step.
1. Go to **Asset management \> Setup \> Workers \> Maintenance worker groups**, and make sure that the maintenance worker record that you identified (or created) in the previous step belongs to a maintenance worker group.
1. Go to **System administration \> Users**.
1. Select the relevant user in the grid.
1. On the **User Details** FastTab, set the **Person** field to the worker account that you want to associate with the current user account. This worker account should be the worker record that you identified (or created) in step 1 and mapped to a maintenance worker record in step 2.

> [!NOTE]
> User permissions and security roles apply to the features of the **Asset management** mobile workspace just as they apply to the features of the Supply Chain Management user interface. Therefore, every user that you set up to access the **Asset management** mobile workspace must have the security roles that are required to perform similar operations directly in Supply Chain Management.

## Publish the Asset management mobile workspace

To make asset management features available in the Finance and Operations (Dynamics 365) mobile app, you must publish the **Asset management** mobile workspace.

1. In Supply Chain Management, select the **Settings** button (the gear symbol in upper-right corner), and then select **Mobile app** on the menu.
1. In the **Manage mobile app** dialog box, find the **Asset Management** tile. If it contains the text "In metadata - not published," the workspace hasn't yet been published. If it contains the text "In metadata - published," the workspace has already been published, and you can skip the rest of this procedure.

1. Select the **Asset Management** tile, and then select **Publish** on the toolbar. After a few seconds, you should receive a notification that states that the workspace has been successfully published. Additionally, the text on the tile should change to "In metadata - published."

## Install and set up the Finance and Operations (Dynamics 365) mobile app

1. Go to one of the following app stores to install the **Microsoft Finance and Operations (Dynamics 365)** app on your mobile device:

    - [For Google Android devices](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850662)
    - [For Apple iOS devices](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850663)

1. Open the Finance and Operations (Dynamics 365) app. The sign-in page should appear. In the **Sign in** field, enter your Supply Chain Management URL, or select a recent URL in the **Recent environments** list, and then tap **Connect**.

1. If you're prompted to confirm the connection, select the **I understand** check box, and then tap **Connect**.
1. On the **Pick an account** page, use your Microsoft account to sign in to the mobile application.

    The **Workspaces** page appears. It lists every mobile workspace that has been published by your Supply Chain Management instance.
