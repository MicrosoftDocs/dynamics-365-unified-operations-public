# Set up disposition codes

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can set up disposition codes to specify how to process an item returned by a customer. For example, create a disposition code named *Repair and return* to indicate that the returned item should be repaired and then returned to the customer. For more examples of disposition codes that are typically used for items returned by customers, see [Specify how to dispose of returned items](specify-how-to-dispose-of-returned-items.md).

You can also set up a reason code to help explain why an item was returned. For more information about reason codes, see [Set up return reason codes](set-up-return-reason-code.md).

To set up a disposition code, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Sales orders** \> **Returns** \> **Disposition codes**.
1. Select **New** to create a new disposition code.
1. Enter a unique, descriptive name, select an action, and enter a description for the disposition code.
1. If you want to associate any customer charges with this disposition code, select the **Charges** button to open the **Set up charges** form.
1. If you want to define any external codes to match with the company's own disposition codes, select the **External codes** button to open the **External codes** form.
