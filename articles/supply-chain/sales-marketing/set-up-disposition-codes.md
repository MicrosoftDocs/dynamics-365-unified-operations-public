# Set up disposition codes

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can set up disposition codes to specify how to process an item that is returned by a customer. For example, create a disposition code named **Repair and return** to indicate that the returned item will be repaired and then returned to the customer. For more examples of disposition codes that are typically used for items that are returned by customers, see [Specify how to dispose of returned items](specify-how-to-dispose-of-returned-items.md).

You can also set up a reason code to help explain why an item was returned. For more information about reason codes, see [Set up return reason codes](set-up-return-reason-code.md).

1. Go to **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Sales orders** \> **Returns** \> **Disposition codes**.

1. Select **New** to create a new disposition code.

1. Enter a unique, descriptive name, select an action, and enter a description for the disposition code.

1. If you want to associate any customer charges with this disposition code, select the **Charges** button to open the **Set up charges** form.

1. If you want to define any external codes to match with the company's own disposition codes, select the **External codes** button to open the **External codes** form.
