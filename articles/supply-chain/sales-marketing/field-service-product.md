# Synchronize products in Supply Chain Management to products in Field Service

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic discusses the templates and underlying task that are used to synchronize products from Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to Dynamics 365  Field Service.

The used **Field Service Products (Supply Chain Management to Field Service)** template is based on the **Products (Supply Chain Management to Sales) – Direct** template from Prospect to Cash. For more information, see [Products (Supply Chain Management to Sales) – Direct](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/sales-marketing/products-template-mapping-direct).

This topic only describes the differences between the **Field Service Products (Supply Chain Management to Field Service)** and **Products (Supply Chain Management to Sales) – Direct** templates.

## Templates and tasks

**Name of the template in Data integration**

- Field Service Products (Supply Chain Management to Field Service)

**Name of the task in the Data integration project**

- Products - Products

The **Field Service Products (Supply Chain Management to Field Service)** template includes one mapping that isn't included in the **Products (Supply Chain Management to Sales) – Direct** template. This mapping ensures that the required Field Service-specific field **Service Product Type** is set correctly.

```Text
FIELDSERVICEPRODUCTTYPE        Fn        msdyn_fieldserciveproducttype
```

The following value mapping is used.

```Text
inventory     :  690970000
nonInventory  :  690970001 
service       :  690970002 
```

In Supply Chain Management, the **Field Service product type** value on the **Sellable released products** data entity is calculated as follows:

- **Inventory:** Product type = Product and Item model group, Stocked product = True
- **NonInventory:** Product type = Product and Item model group, Stocked product = False
- **Service:** Product type = Service

## Template mapping in Data integration

The following illustrations show the template mapping in Data integration.
