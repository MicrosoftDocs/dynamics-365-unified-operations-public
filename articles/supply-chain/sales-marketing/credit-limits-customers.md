# Credit limits for customers

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Setting a credit limit lets you specify the maximum amount of credit to extend
to your customers. If a credit limit is specified, it is checked automatically
when a user attempts to update a document. If the credit limit is exceeded, a
message is displayed to the user. This article provides an overview of how credit
limits work  and answers the following questions:

-   What documents and processes can I check credit limits for?

-   Where do I configure the way that the customer’s remaining credit is
    calculated?

-   Where is information about a customer’s remaining credit used?

-   Where do I specify whether identification is required for credit to be
    extended to a customer, and also the credit limit amount that requires
    identification?

-   Where do I specify whether to display a warning or error if the credit limit
    is exceeded?

-   How do I specify the credit limit for a specific customer?

-   How do I check credit limits manually on sales orders?

**What documents and processes can I check credit limits for?**

Use the **Accounts receivable parameters** form to specify which documents to
check credit limits for. You must be a member of the System administrator
(-SYSADMIN-) security role to make changes in this form. You can check credit
limits for the following documents and processes:

-   Invoices for sales orders, when you post the invoices

-   Packing slips for sales orders, when you update packing slips

-   Sales orders, when you add lines in the **Sales order** form

-   Sales orders, when they are created through a service

-   Free text invoices, when you post the invoices

Credit limits are automatically checked if either of the following options is
set:

-   In the **Accounts receivable parameters** form, the **Credit limit type**
    field is set to anything other than **None**. Credit limits are checked for
    all customers.

-   In the **Accounts receivable parameters** form, the **Credit limit type**
    field is set to **None** but **Mandatory credit limit** is selected for a
    customer in the **Customers** form. Credit limits are checked only for
    specific customers.

To check credit limits for the following documents, you must specify additional
settings.

|    Document                                    |    Additional setting                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Free text   invoice                         |    In the Accounts receivable parameters   form, in the Credit rating area, select Check credit limit on free   text invoice.     |
|    Sales   order (manually entered)            |    In the Accounts receivable parameters   form, in the Credit rating area, select Check credit limit on sales   order.           |
|    Sales   order (electronically received)     |    In the Accounts receivable parameters   form, in the AIF area, select Check credit limit for sales orders.                     |

**Where do I configure the way that a customer’s remaining credit is
calculated?**

You can configure Dynamics 365 to calculate a customer’s remaining
credit in any of the following ways:

-   Compare the credit limit against the customer balance.

-   Compare the credit limit against the customer balance and packing slip
    amounts.

-   Compare the credit limit against the customer balance and all open
    transaction activity. This includes packing slip amounts and sales order
    amounts.

Use the **Accounts receivable parameters** form to specify the information to
compare to. You must be a member of the System administrator (-SYSADMIN-)
security role to make changes in this form. In the **Credit limit type** field,
select whether to perform credit limit checks and what transaction information
to include when the credit limit is checked. Select from the following options:

-   **None** – Do not check credit limits. You can override this option for a
    specific customer by selecting the **Mandatory credit limit** check box in
    the **Customers** form. If you do this, the credit limit is checked against
    the customer balance.

-   **Balance** – The credit limit is checked against the customer balance.

-   **Balance + packing slip or product receipt** – The credit limit is checked
    against the customer balance and deliveries.

-   **Balance+All** – The credit limit is checked against the customer balance,
    deliveries, and open orders.

**Where is information about a customer’s remaining credit used?**

Information about a customer’s balance and remaining credit amount is calculated
and stored when you create an aging snapshot, and is displayed in the
**Collections** form. The amounts that are displayed in the **Collections** form
might not include all transaction activity until a new aging snapshot is
created. For more information, see [Collections and credit in Accounts
receivable](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209221.aspx).

Depending on the documents that are selected, information about a customer’s
balance and remaining credit amount is calculated when sales orders, packing
slips, and customer invoices are updated. If the amount of the document that you
are working with would cause the credit limit to be exceeded, a message is
displayed.

**Where do I specify whether identification is required for credit to be
extended to a customer, and also the credit limit that requires
identification?**

Use the **Accounts receivable parameters** form to specify whether to require
identification and the credit limit amount limit that requires identification.
You must be a member of the System administrator (-SYSADMIN-) security role to
make changes in this form.

|    Require   identification with credit     |    Select the type of identification that must be   entered for customers to whom your legal entity extends credit. The option   that you select in this field determines when and what type of information is   required in the Government identification fields in the Customers   form:        No – No government-issued        identification is required, regardless of the customer's credit limit.     Yes – A        government-issued license number or other government-issued        identification is required if the customer's credit limit is higher than        or equal to zero.     Minimum limit – A        government-issued license number or other government-issued        identification is required if the customer's credit limit is higher than        or equal to the limit that you enter in the Limit field in this        form.        |
|    Limit                                    |    Enter the credit limit at which a   government-issued license number or other identification is required for   customers.    For example, type 2000 to require that an   identification number, such as a driver's license number, must be entered for   customers who have a credit limit of 2,000 or higher.    This field is available if you selected Minimum   limit in the Require identification with credit field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Where do I specify whether to display a warning or error if the credit limit
is exceeded?**

Use the **Accounts receivable parameters** form to specify whether to display a
warning or error if the credit limit is exceeded. This warning or error is
displayed when a user is entering or posting information, or it is included in a
log if the documents are being processed by an electronic service. You must be a
member of the System administrator (-SYSADMIN-) security role to make changes in
this form.

|    Field                                                               |    Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Message when exceeding credit limit (in the Credit rating area)     |    Select how messages about credit limits being   exceeded are displayed to users. Select from the following options:        Error – An        error message is displayed. This usually stops the current operation and        the conflict must be resolved before the process can continue.     Warning – A        warning message is displayed, but the process can continue.                     |
|    Message when exceeding credit limit (in the AIF area)               |    Select how messages about credit limits being   exceeded are delivered in a log. Select from the following options:        Error – An        error message is displayed in the Exceptions form, and the        document will not be processed until the error is resolved.     Warning – A        warning message is displayed in the Exceptions form, but the        process can continue.        |

**How do I specify the credit limit amount for a specific customer?**

Use the **Customers** form to specify the credit limit amount for a specific
customer. You must be a member of a security role that has the Maintain customer
master (CustCustomersMaintain) duty assigned to it to make changes in this form.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All
    customers**. Double-click a customer account.

2.  In the **Customers** form, on the Action Pane, click **Edit**.

3.  Enter a currency amount in the **Credit limit** field. This value must be
    higher than zero (0), and will be used as the credit limit amount.

4.  If it is required, enter a license number or other government-issued
    identification in the **Government identification** field.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Accounts receivable parameters** form, a credit limit type is typically selected. However, if the credit limit type is set to **None**, you must also select the **Mandatory credit limit** check box in the **Customers** form in order to check the customer’s credit limit against the customer’s balance. For more information about credit limit types, see “What documents and processes can I check credit limits for?” in this topic. 

**How do I manually check credit limits on sales orders?**

Sometimes, you might have to manually check a customer’s credit limit. For
example, you might manually check a customer’s credit limit before you start
entering a sales order. You can use the **Sales order** form to manually check
credit limits. You must be a member of a security role that has the Maintain
sales order (SalesOrderMaintain) duty assigned to it to make changes in this
form.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All
    sales orders**. Double-click a sales order.

2.  In the **Sales order** form, on the Action Pane, on the **Manage** tab,
    click **Check credit limit**.
