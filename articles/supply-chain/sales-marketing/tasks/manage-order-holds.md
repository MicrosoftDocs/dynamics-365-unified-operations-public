# Manage order holds

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure demonstrates how to place customer sales orders on hold, how to work with order hold checkouts, and how to remove order holds. An order might be placed on hold for a variety of reasons. For example, you might hold an order until a customer address or payment method can be verified or until a manager can review the customerâ€™s credit limit. While the order on hold, it cannot be processed by the warehouse for shipping. 

You can run this procedure in demo data company USMF or on your own data.

    * For example, type Call back.  
4. In the Description field, type a value.
    * For example, Order held waiting for customer callback.  
    * Optionally, select the Remove reservations check box to remove any physical reservations from the order when this hold code is added.  
5. Click Save.

    * Orders that are currently on hold have the "Do not process" and "Hold" fields marked.    
15. On the Action Pane, click Pick and pack.

## Manage order holds
