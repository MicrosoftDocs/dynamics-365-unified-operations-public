# Return reason codes and disposition codes

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Create and use return reason codes and disposition codes to support the process for returning products.

Use a return reason code to describe the reason that the customer wants to return an item. You can assign a reason code in the **Create return orders** form.

Assign a disposition code when an item is received or during the physical inspection of a returned item. You can use disposition codes to describe the condition of the item. You can also use disposition codes to indicate whether additional action is required for the transaction. For example, create disposition codes for the following actions:

- Scrap the returned item and provide a replacement item to the customer.
- Return the item to inventory and credit the customer for the cost of the item.
- Repair the item and return it to the customer.
