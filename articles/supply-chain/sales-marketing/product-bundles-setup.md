# Enable and set up product bundles

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Prerequisites

This feature requires Supply Chain Management version 10.0.36 or higher.

## Turn on the Product bundle feature for your system

To make product bundle functionality available, you must turn it on for your system.

1. Go to **System administration \> Workspaces \> Feature management**. (For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).)
1. On the **All** tab, use the **Filter** field to search for the feature that's named *Revenue recognition*.
1. If the *Revenue recognition* feature is enabled in your system, select it in the list, and then select **Disable** to disable it. You can't use this feature together with the *Product bundle* feature that you'll enable in the next steps.
1. Use the **Filter** field to search for the feature that's named *Product bundle*.
1. Select the feature in the list, and then select **Enable now** to enable it.

> [!NOTE]
> When you first turn on the *Product bundle* feature, the system checks whether it includes any released products where the **Revenue recognition bundle** option is set to *Yes*. If it does, the system creates a batch job that automatically upgrades the records for those products so that they will work with the *Product bundle* feature. Likewise, if the system includes any uncanceled sales orders that have lines that contain revenue recognition bundle items, those sales order lines are also upgraded so that they will work with the *Product bundle* feature. This behavior should provide a seamless experience as you transition from using revenue recognition bundles to using product bundles. The upgrade is done as part of a Data maintenance portal action.

## Set up product bundles

Bundle items are released products that include components. You set up bundle items by using the bill of materials (BOM) functionality. When a product bundle item is entered on a sales order, revenue is posted for the individual components, not for the product bundle item.

Documents that are printed for the customer (such as sales order confirmations and invoices) show only the product bundle item, not the components. However, documents that are printed for internal use (such as sales order picking lists and packing slips) show only the components, not the product bundle item. For more information, see [Sell and allocate product bundles](product-bundles-use.md).

### Set up product bundle components

Each component item of a product bundle must be set up as a released product on the **Released products** page (**Product information management \> Products \> Released products**). The released products are set up in the same way as products that are included on a BOM. For example, a released product can be an item of either the *Item* type or the *Service* type, but it must be assigned to an item model group where the **Stocked product** option is set to *Yes*. For more information, see [Bills of materials and formulas](../production-control/bill-of-material-bom.md).

In addition, a base sales price must be set for each component. The base sales price is used to calculate the component's revenue contribution percentage. The product bundle's revenue price is then distributed to the components based on their revenue contribution percentages. For more information, see [Sell and allocate product bundles](product-bundles-use.md).

### Set up product bundle items

Each product bundle item must be set up as a released product on the **Released products** page (**Product information management \> Products \> Released products**). To identify a released product as a bundle item, you must set the following two fields on the released product record:

- On the **General** FastTab, set the **Product Bundle** option to *Yes*.
- On the **Engineer** FastTab, set the **Production type** field to *BOM*.

The component items must be then assigned to the product bundle (BOM parent) item on the **BOM versions** page. To open this page, open the product bundle item on the **Released products** page. Then, on the Action Pane, on the **Engineer** tab, select **BOM versions**. For more information, see [Bills of materials and formulas](../production-control/bill-of-material-bom.md).
