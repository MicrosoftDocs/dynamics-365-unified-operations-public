# Troubleshoot sales quotations

This topic describes how to fix issues that you might encounter while you work with sales quotations.

## I can't change the sales quantity of a sales quotation for a service item.

### Issue description

If you try to set a sales quantity (**SalesQty** field) for an item of the *Service* type on a sales quotation line, you will receive the following message: "Update not allowed for field Quantity."

### Issue resolution

You can't set a sales quantity for products that are service items. For example, if you offer a service to install an item, it doesn't make sense to record a quantity, because there is no physical item. There is only a service.
