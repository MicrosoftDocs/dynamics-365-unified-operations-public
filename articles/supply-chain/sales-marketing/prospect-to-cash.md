# Prospect to cash  

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Prospect to cash solution uses [Data Integration](/common-data-service/entity-reference/dynamics-365-integration) to synchronize data across Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition and Dynamics 365 for Sales instances via the Common Data Service (CDS). The Prospect to cash templates available with the Data Integration feature enable the flow of accounts, contacts, products, sales quotes, sales orders, and sales invoices data between Finance and Operations and Sales. While the data is flowing between Finance and Operations and Sales, you can carry out sales and marketing activities in Sales and handle the order fulfillment with inventory management in Finance and Operations. 

This solution provides integration in the following areas: 

-   [Maintain accounts in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations](accounts-template-mapping.md)
-   [Maintain contacts in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations](contacts-template-mapping.md)
-   [Maintain products in Finance and Operations and sync them to Sales](products-template-mapping.md)
- 	[Create sales quotes in Sales and sync them to Finance and Operations](sales-quotation-template-mapping.md)
-   [Create sales orders in Finance and Operations and sync them to Sales](sales-order-template-mapping.md)
-   [Create sales invoices in Finance and Operations and sync them to Sales](sales-invoice-template-mapping.md)
