# Monitor and manage IoT Intelligence

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to monitor and manage IoT Intelligence.

## <a id="monitor-scenarios"></a>Monitor scenarios in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

You can monitor IoT Intelligence processing from several places:

+ **Modules \> Production control \> Inquiries and reports \> IoT Intelligence \> Notifications** – View the list of unresolved notifications.
+ **Modules \> Production control \> Inquiries and reports \> IoT Intelligence \> Closed notifications** – View the list of notifications that have been resolved or dismissed.
+ **Modules \> Production control \> Inquiries and reports \> IoT Intelligence \> Metric keys** – View the metric keys for the **Resource Status** times series charts.
+ **Modules \> Production control \> Manufacturing execution \> Resource status** – Track specific metrics by using the **Configure** dialog box. If a scenario detects an exception, a notification shows the details of the exception.
+ **Workspaces \> Production floor management \> Notifications** – View the list of unresolved notifications.

## Modify a running IoT Intelligence scenario

When a scenario is running, you can make these changes:

+ Add new sensor schema definitions.
+ Select new signal data values.
+ Cancel the selection of existing signal data values.
+ Add and map new signal data values.
+ Update threshold values.

When a scenario is running, these changes are prohibited:

+ Delete or modify any schema definitions that are currently consumed by an enabled scenario.
+ Change the enabled scenario's selected schema paths.

## Simulation options

You can simulate factory machine signals. For more information, see these topics:
