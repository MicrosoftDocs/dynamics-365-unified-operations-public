<!-- KFM: Preview until further notice -->

This article describes how to Install, update, or uninstall the various components of the Traceability Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## Prerequisites

To use Traceability, your system must meet the following requirements:

- You must be running Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.40 (build 10.0.1935.80) or higher.
- Your Supply Chain Management installation must be running on one of the following types of environments:
    - Tier-2 environment
    - A Unified Developer Experience (UDE) environment copied from a tier-2 environment that didn't have Traceability installed. Copying an environment with Traceability already installed isn't supported.
- The Dynamics 365 app named *Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Platform Tools* must be installed for your environment in [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

## Turn on features in Supply Chain Management

To use Traceability together with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, you must enable the following features in [feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md):

- *Tracked components* – Enables component tracking in Supply Chain Management. As of Supply Chain Management version 10.0.45, this feature is turned on by default.
- *(Preview) Traceability* – Integrates Traceability with the component tracking features in Supply Chain Management.

## Microsoft Azure configuration

### Register a new Microsoft Entra application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for or navigate to the **App registrations** page.
1. On the toolbar, select **New registration**.
1. Fill out the **Register and application** page and select **Register**. For more information about these settings, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate).
1. Your new app registration opens. On the left navigation pane, select **Overview**. Copy the following values to a temporary text file. You'll need them later.
    - **Application (client) ID**
    - **Directory (tenant) ID**

### Create client secrets for the new Microsoft Entra application

1. In the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), open the application you registered in the previous section.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Manage** \> **Certificates & secrets**.
1. On the **Certificates & secrets** page, select **New client secret**.
1. In the **Add a client secret** dialog, enter a description and choose an expiration date for the secret. Then select **Add**.
1. The **Certificates & secrets** page now includes your new secret. Copy the **Value** and **Secret ID** of the secret and store it in a secure location. You'll need these values later when [setting up communication with the API](traceability-api.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **Value** is only displayed once, so you won't be able to retrieve it again after closing this page.
