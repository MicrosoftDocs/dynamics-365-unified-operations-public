You can access the Traceability app in two ways: from Supply Chain Management or from Power Platform. This article describes both methods.

## Access Traceability from Supply Chain Management

When you enable the *(Preview) Traceability* feature in [feature management](developer/traceability-install.md), the system adds a **Traceability** tile to the **Apps** section of the **Home** page of Supply Chain Management, as shown in the following image. To open the Traceability app, select the tile.

## Access Traceability from Power Platform

Follow these steps to open the Traceability app from Power Platform after you [install](developer/traceability-install.md) it in your environment.

1. Sign in to [Power Platform maker](https://make.powerapps.com/).
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Apps**. The **Apps** page opens.
1. Open the **My apps** tab. Look for the app with a **Name** of *Traceability*. If you don't see it on the **My apps** tab, switch to the **All** tab and look for it there.
1. Hover your mouse over the *Traceability* app to reveal the **Play** button next to it. Select the **Play** button to run the app.
