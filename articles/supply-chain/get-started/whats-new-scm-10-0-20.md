## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features included in this release. The *Feature* column provides links to the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features), where you can see the official release dates for each feature. The *More information* column provides more details and/or links to related documentation.

Most of these features must be enabled using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) before you can use them.

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements included in this release. Each of these provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they are not listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted). If you want to use any of these features, you must explicitly enable them in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Module | Feature&nbsp;name&nbsp;in feature&nbsp;management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Master planning | Parallel authorizing of adjusted demand forecast | This feature allows parallel authorizing of adjusted demand forecast from the **Adjusted demand forecast** page. The intent of this feature is to increase performance when a high number of forecasts are being authorized. When authorizing, the user can specify the **Number of threads** in the authorizing dialog. |
| Master planning | (Preview) Batchable firming and consolidation for planned bulk and pack batch orders | This feature lets you use batch jobs to firm and consolidate planned bulk and pack orders. |
| Production control | Copy generic routes | This feature enhances the copy route function to allow users to copy routes that aren't item specific. It enables the system to update all relevant information (such as site, route group, resource requirements, and various times) after the copy route function has been used to overwrite a route that is not yet assigned to an item. |
| Production control | Update related resource requirements when a route operation is changed | This feature enables the system to update the related resource requirements after a user changes the operation of an existing route step. |
| Product information management | Bill of materials report pre-processing to prevent timeout | This feature causes the bill of materials report to be pre-processed. This will avoid timeout issues when having a large data load for the report. |
| Procurement and sourcing | Enable resetting procurement related workflows | This preview feature allows you to reset the following workflows to draft status: Purchase Order, Vendor Change, and Purchase Requisitions. |
| Transportation management | Enable creation of a vendor invoice journal when discarding a freight bill | When this feature is enabled, a corresponding vendor invoice journal will only be created for reconciliation reasons when you are using the pay-vendor option. Otherwise, the invoice journal will always be created. |
| Warehouse management | Validate templates selected for replenishment jobs | This feature helps ensure that users select valid replenishment templates when setting up a replenishment job. It prevents users from creating a replenishment job without a template and from selecting templates of type *Wave demand*, which won't create any replenishment work and may take a long time to process. |

### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
