## <a name="enhancements"></a>Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they're only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2023wave2/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

Some of these features aren't visible on your system until you turn them on in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) using the name listed here for the *Feature management name* (additional configuration may also be needed). Features that don't show a feature management name are visible by default as of this version of Supply Chain Management, but typically add a new option that you need to select to use the new functionality.

| Feature enhancement | Description |
|---|---|
|<p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** *Consolidate including incoming work* location directive action strategy</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>Adds a new [location directive action](../warehousing/create-location-directive.md#location-directive-actions-fasttab) strategy called *Consolidate including incoming work*. It works like the existing *Consolidate* strategy, except it also considers locations where items on incoming put-work lines aren't already available. This is beneficial when receiving multiple license plates with the same item and the items should be moved to the same location. This can be useful, for example, when receiving based on advance shipping notices (ASNs).</p><p>For more information, see [Work with location directives](../warehousing/create-location-directive.md). |
|<p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** Full license plate movement policy</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>Lets workers move license plates more quickly in the warehouse by reducing the number of scans needed when using a *Movement* or *Movement by template* mobile device menu item.</p><p>For more information, see [Set up a mobile device menu item for moving items in the warehouse](../warehousing/mobile-device-movement-menu.md) and [Set up a mobile device menu item for moving items by template](../warehousing/mobile-device-move-by-template-menu.md). |
|<p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** Split transfer order registration and receiving when using the Warehouse Management mobile app</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>Makes it possible to split the registration and cost-update processes for transfer orders, which lets receiving clerks use the Warehouse Management mobile app to update a transfer order receipt without waiting for any financial background processing, regardless of the receiving flow.  Previously, it was only possible to split registrations and cost updates during license plate receiving.</p><p>To enable this capability, go to the **Warehouse management parameters** page, open the **General** tab, expand the **Receiving** FastTab and set **Transfer order receiving process** to *Split the registration and receiving for all flows*.</p> |
|<p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Inventory transaction details page's performance improvement.*</p> | <p>Improves the performance of the **Inventory transactions details** page. Users can now set default filters, so that the page shows only frequently checked inventory transactions. In addition, the page shows only inventory-related fields.</p><p>To access the **Inventory transaction details** page, go to **Inventory management** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Transactions**.</p> |
|<p>**Module:** Inventory and warehouse management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Inventory Visibility integration with ATP*</p>| Enables the system to send the on-hand change schedule to Inventory Visibility to support available-to-promise (ATP) calculations. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Actions based on requested date for Planning Optimization*</p>| Introduces a parameter that lets you specify what date action messages are based on. When action messages are based on the required date, changes are suggested only if they're feasible. This behavior matches the previous behavior. When action messages are based on the requested date, they can give a better idea of how late orders are. However, the suggestions might not be possible. For example, there might be a suggestion to advance a number of days that's impossible according to lead times, or there might be a suggestion to create an order in the past. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Allows to create Planned order setting Purchase quantity instead of Requirement quantity*</p>| Makes it possible to create planned orders that set the purchase quantity instead of the requirement quantity. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Enable the calculation of CTP for Planning Optimization even when plan run ends with errors*</p>| Makes it possible to calculate capable-to-promise (CTP) confirmed dates for sales order lines even when the Planning Optimization run ended with errors. The confirmed dates are calculated for sales order lines that didn't have any errors. To enable or disable this behavior, use the **Calculate CTP for Planning Optimization even with errors** setting for the master plan. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Exclude demand forecasts for a certain time period for Planning Optimization*</p>| Makes it possible to ignore the forecasted demand for a specified period. This capability is useful if you don't want to supply for forecasts during the upcoming period. Any forecasted demand that occurs after the number of days that you specify is ignored and therefore isn't supplied for. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Min/Max coverage code rounding for Planning Optimization*</p>| Adds a setting that lets you control how values are rounded when you use multiples in a min/max coverage code. Round down to ensure that the quantities always stay within the maximum limit. This option is useful if the maximum represents the physical space of your warehouse. Round up to ensure that the maximum quantity is always fulfilled. This option is useful if the maximum represents a calculated value for your company to fulfill demand. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Recalculation of finite material date optionally for Planning Optimization*</p>| Adds a setting that lets you specify whether finite material availability dates should be recalculated when you reschedule production orders that have finite materials. We recommend that you *don't* recalculate for master plans that you've recently run, because the result will be faster rescheduling of multiple orders. Without this feature, the date is always recalculated. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Round down advance action days*</p>| Adds a new option for coverage groups that lets you round down advance action days. For example, the difference between the supply requirement date/time and the receipt requirement date/time is one day and four hours. If the new option is turned on, the result of the calculation is one advance action day. If the option is turned off, the result is two advance action days. This option is especially useful for preventing master planning from suggesting an advance of one day whenever the supply and the demand are on the same day. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Sort on requested date in Net requirements form*</p>| Adds an option that lets you sort by using the **Requested date** field instead of the **Requirement date** field on the **Net requirements** page. |
|<p>**Module:** Product information management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Allow hazardous material divisions with same division codes in different material classes*</p>| Lets users create hazardous material divisions that have the same division code in different hazardous material classes. The feature creates a new data table to enable divisions that have the same code and moves data to this new table. |
|<p>**Module:** Production control</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Default order settings for Change production order BOM item*</p>| Updates the *Change BOM item* feature so that your default order settings are used to set the from-item and to-item. |
|<p>**Module:** Sales and marketing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Enable prospects in Sales quotation lifecycle with Dynamics 365 Sales*</p>| Enables the integration of prospects between Dynamics 365 Sales and Supply Chain Management over dual-write. Prospects in Supply Chain Management integrate with account type *Prospect* in Dynamics 365 Sales. The lifecycle of a prospect from creation to converting into a customer is supported from both Dynamics 365 Sales and Supply Chain Management and is seamlessly integrated into the quotation winning process. With this feature, it's possible to use the prospect on a quotation in Supply Chain Management and as a potential customer in Dynamics 365 Sales. This feature adds a parameter to the **Accounts receivable parameters** page, which lets you turn the functionality on or off.<br><br>**Important**: This feature is a component of the upcoming [Enable prospects in prospect-to-cash with dual-write](/dynamics365/release-plan/2023wave2/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/enable-prospects-prospect-to-cash-dual-write) functionality. Some of the components required to fully support this functionality won't be available until a future release of dual-write becomes available. Until then, this feature will have no effect, so we recommend against enabling it for now. |
|<p>**Module:** Sales and marketing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Faster vendor search*</p>| Improves the performance of the **Vendor search** dialog box by implementing an improved data model. |
|<p>**Module:** Sales and marketing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Replace alternative item defaults on sales lines*</p>| Adds a new parameter, **Replace alternative item defaults on sales lines**, to the **General** tab of the **Accounts Receivable parameters** page. When this parameter is set to *Yes*, and alternative items must always be used, all item-dependent information (such as financial dimensions and units of measure) from the alternative item replace the original item information on the sales order line. When the parameter is set to *No*, all the information from the original item remains on the sales order line, and no replacements are made. When you first enable this feature, the parameter is set to *Yes* by default. Therefore, the system behaves just as it does without this feature. |
|<p>**Module:** Sales and marketing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Sales referenced data export policy*</p>| Adds the following parameters to the **General** tab of the **Accounts receivable parameters** page: **Skip referenced data during change tracking** and **Skip sales quotation referenced data during change tracking**. When these two parameters are enabled, changes to referenced data doesn't cause sales orders, sales order lines, sales quotations, and/or sales quotation lines to be included in the next incremental export. By turning off these parameters, you can help incremental exports run more quickly. |
