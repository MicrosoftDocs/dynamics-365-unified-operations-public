### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
