## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements included in this release. Each of these provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they are not listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted). If you want to use any of these features, you must explicitly enable them in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Module | Feature&nbsp;name&nbsp;in feature&nbsp;management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Cost management | Inventory closing progress details | This preview feature enables a detailed view of inventory closing progress. |
| Procurement and sourcing | Prevent overconsumption of general budget reservations when multiple purchase requisitions are in workflow | This preview feature improves error checking when users submit and approve purchase requisitions that exceed the remaining balance of a general budget reservation line. This helps prevent overconsumption of general budget reservations when multiple purchase requisitions are in workflow. |
| Production control | Show full serial, batch, and license plate numbers in the production floor execution interface | This feature provides an improved experience for viewing lists of serial, batch, and license plate numbers in the production floor execution interface. The display changes from a card view with a limited number of characters to a list view that provides enough space to show the full values. The list also provides the ability to search for specific numbers. |
| Sales and marketing | Limit the number of sales orders that can be selected for posting | This feature lets you define the maximum number of sales orders that can be selected when posting confirmations, picking lists, packing slips, and invoices from the sales orders list page. It is enabled automatically. The feature adds a setting called **Max. number of sales orders for posting** to the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. The new setting defaults to a value of *100*. The feature helps improve the performance of the sales orders list page when a substantial number of sales orders are selected. It has no impact on the number of sales orders that can be processed by a periodic task. |
| Warehouse management | Decouple putaway work from ASNs | This feature is required to send and receive advance shipping notices (ASNs) when you are running a warehouse management workload on a scale unit (as part of a distributed hybrid topology). It adds a new database table dedicated to storing information about putaway work. Previously, this information was stored in tables also used for the ASNs. |
| Warehouse management | Slot mixed units | Allows the system to slot items into locations that include mixed units (such as both boxes and cases). For each slotting template line, this feature allows you to choose whether the line should slot items into mixed-unit or single-unit locations. |
| Warehouse management | Use faster API for containers closing/reopening on packing station | When this preview feature is enabled, inventory transactions related to containers are created using a new light-weight process that improves performance of closing or reopening containers during manual packing-station processing. |

## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in 10.0.21. Most features that have been turned on atomically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
