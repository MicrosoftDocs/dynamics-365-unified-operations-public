## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features included in this release. The *Feature* column provides links to the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features), where you can see the official release dates for each feature. The *More information* column provides more details and/or links to related documentation.

Most of these features must be enabled using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) before you can use them.

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements included in this release. Each of these provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they are not listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted). If you want to use any of these features, you must explicitly enable them in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Module | Feature&nbsp;name&nbsp;in feature&nbsp;management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Sales and marketing | Sales history cleanup performance improvements | Sales history cleanup can take a long time if run infrequently on environments with a high volume of sales updates. To reduce duration and improve reliability, this feature splits clean-up into batches that run for a limited duration. Where possible, database capabilities will be leveraged to minimize locking and avoid joining transactional tables during cleanup. For more information, see [Schedule sales history data cleanup](../sales-marketing/sales-update-history-cleanup-performance-improvements.md). |
| Sales and marketing | Update Requested receipt date with Confirmed date for intercompany orders | This feature lets you control what will happen to sales and purchase date field values when using intercompany direct delivery. You can choose whether the system will update requested dates or skip updating them. If you skip the update, the requested dates will represent what the customer has requested. If you enable updating, the requested dates (when using delivery date control) only initially represent what the customer requested. Delivery date control, when different from *None*, will overrule what has initially been requested. You can set this option using the new **Update Requested receipt date with Confirmed date** setting on the intercompany vendor or customer settings.<br><br>If the feature is disabled, the system will overwrite the requested receipt date on original sales orders based on the delivery date control rule, but the requested shipping date will remain as is. |
| Warehouse management | Round quantities down to nearest sales unit on release to warehouse | This feature adds an option that can restrict order quantities on release to warehouse. When enabled, order quantities will be rounded down to the nearest whole sales unit, and orders that include quantities for less than one sales unit will be rejected for release. |
| Warehouse management | Organization-wide "Schedule work creation" wave method | On enabling this feature, the *Schedule work creation* wave method will be configured to run in parallel across all legal entities. Several additional settings will also be affected. For complete details, see [Schedule work creation during wave](../warehousing/configure-wave-schedule-work-creation.md). |

### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
