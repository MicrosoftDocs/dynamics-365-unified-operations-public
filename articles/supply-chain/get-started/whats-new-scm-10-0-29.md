## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

If you want to turn any of these features on or off, you must do so in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Module | Feature name in feature management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Cost management | Optimization of co-product pending price calculation | This feature fixes a conflict that can sometimes occur when co-product prices are calculated by using multiple threads. It causes the system to make sure that each co-product price is calculated just once. The result of that calculation is then used as the input for all other calculations. If a pending price already exists, that price is used. |
| Master planning | Group transactions in Planning Optimization | This feature can help reduce the number of planned orders that are generated to supply a single sales order line when you're using Planning Optimization. When this feature is turned on, Planning Optimization will group all inventory transactions for an order line into a single requirement for the full quantity. (This behavior matches the built-in planning engine behavior.) Supply and demand are grouped separately. Therefore, the feature helps reduce the transaction volume when you have split transactions and when you use dimensions (such as batch numbers or serial numbers) that aren't coverage dimensions. |
| Procurement and sourcing | Put vendor on hold for purchase orders | This feature lets you put a vendor on hold for purchase orders. It adds a new *Purchase order* hold type that marks a vendor as on hold for purchase orders. You won't be able to create new purchase orders for vendors that are on hold for purchase orders, but you will still be able to proceed with any open invoices or payments for those vendors. |
| Sales and marketing | Calculate line net amount on import | This feature lets you control whether the system should recalculate line totals when you import data through the *Sales order lines*, *Sales quotation lines*, or *Return order lines* entity using OData or dual-write. It only has an effect when you also have trade agreement evaluation policies in place that restrict changes to the **Net amount** field for sales order lines, sales quotation lines, and/or return order lines. It adds a setting called **Calculate line net amount** to the **Accounts receivable > Setup > Accounts receivable parameters** page. When this setting is set to *Yes*, the system will always recalculate line amounts when needed (thereby ignoring any trade agreement evaluation policy for the line net amount). When the setting is set to *No*, the system will never automatically calculate the line net amount, even when incoming changes to the line price, quantity, and/or discount would imply that the line net amount should be recalculated. This feature is enabled by default and initially sets **Calculate line net amount** to *Yes*. The *No* setting matches the system behavior prior to version 10.0.23 and is provided chiefly to support legacy integration scenarios.<br><br>For more information, see [Recalculate line net amounts when importing sales orders, quotations, and returns](../sales-marketing/calc-line-net-amounts-import.md). |
| Sales and marketing | Calculate sales totals using multiple threads | This feature helps improve performance by enabling the system to use parallel processing when it calculates sales totals in a batch. The feature adds a new **Number of threads** field to the **Calculate sales totals** dialog box. If you choose to run the calculation in a batch, you can use this field to set the maximum number of threads. If you set the value to *0* (zero) or *1*, a single thread will be used. Values above 1 enable multithreading. |
| Sales and marketing | Update prices and discounts entered manually for intercompany | This feature adds support for manual change policies for intercompany orders. It includes support for transferring manual change policies between intercompany sales and purchase orders. Previously, manual change policies were supported only for non-intercompany orders. When this feature is enabled, the system will give you the option to update prices and discounts after you save changes to an intercompany order. This option lets you choose whether you want to apply the new prices and discounts details to the intercompany order or leave the order unchanged. |

## New and updated documentation resources

We have recently added or significantly updated the following Help articles. These articles aren't necessarily related to the new features that were added for this release, as listed in the previous sections. However, they might help you get more out of existing features.

## Feature state changes in this release

The following table lists features that became mandatory or on by default in version 10.0.29. All these features will automatically be turned on for your system as soon as you update to version 10.0.29. Mandatory features can't be turned off, but features that are on by default can still be turned off by using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

The table also lists features that were previously in public preview but have changed to become generally available in version 10.0.29. This change indicates that the features are now recommended for use in production environments. These features are turned off by default unless otherwise noted. Therefore, you must use [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) to enable them if you want to use them.

### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
