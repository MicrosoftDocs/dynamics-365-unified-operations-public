# Standard saved views for Supply Chain Management

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes several saved views that you can enable and use as needed. Some of these standard saved views are optimized and named for a specific role or task (for example, "Quality control" or "Receiving"). Others are optimized so that they include only the fields and settings that Microsoft usage statistics indicate are most often used by customers. These saved views are typically referred to as *simplified* views. This article describes the standard saved views that are available, and explains how to enable and customize them.

For complete details about how to work with saved views, including the standard saved views, after you enable them, see [Saved views](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/saved-views.md?toc=/dynamics365/supply-chain/toc.json).

## Customizing the standard saved views

You can customize the standard saved views, just as you can customize your own saved views. However, when you customize a standard saved view, we strongly recommend that you save your custom version under a new name. Otherwise, your customizations could be overwritten when you update Supply Chain Management.

For more information about how to customize and rename saved views, see [Saved views](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/saved-views.md?toc=/dynamics365/supply-chain/toc.json).
