## Features removed or deprecated in the Supply Chain Management 10.0.41 release

### Inventory transactions support for internal warehouse operations

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  |
|---|---|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Using inventory transactions to track on-hand inventory for internal warehouse operations has well-known performance issues. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes. [Warehouse-specific inventory transactions](../warehousing/warehouse-transactions.md), which have been available since version 10.0.32, replace the older inventory transactions for tracking internal warehouse operations.  |
| **Product areas affected** | Supply Chain Management - Warehouse management |
| **Deployment option** | Cloud and on-premises |
| **Status** | <p>Supported until version 10.0.40. As of version 10.0.41, inventory transactions will be deprecated for tracking on-hand inventory for internal warehouse operations. Existing customers will be able to continue using this scenario after that version, but new features and bug fixes for this scenario will only be implemented for [warehouse-specific inventory transactions](../warehousing/warehouse-transactions.md).</p><p>Approximately one year after the release of version 10.0.41, support for this scenario will be removed and all customers will be required to move to [warehouse-specific inventory transactions](../warehousing/warehouse-transactions.md) for tracking on-hand inventory for internal warehouse operations.</p> |

## Features removed or deprecated in the Supply Chain Management 10.0.37 release

### Service-based authentication methods for the Warehouse Management mobile app

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  |
|---|---|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | Support for service-based authentication methods (certificate and shared secret) is being removed to improve security. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes. Service-based authentication is being replaced by user-based authentication (device code flow), which is more secure. |
| **Product areas affected** | Supply Chain Management - Warehouse management |
| **Deployment option** | Cloud and on-premises |
| **Status** | <p>Deprecated. As of July 15, 2024, Microsoft will discontinue support for using service-based authentication methods (certificate and shared secret) to connect the Warehouse Management mobile app to Supply Chain Management. Service-based authentication is being replaced by user-based authentication (device code flow). Administrators must update all devices to use user-based authentication before July 15, 2024. For more information about device code flow, see [User-based authentication FAQ](../warehousing/warehouse-app-user-based-auth-faq.md) and [User-based authentication](../warehousing/warehouse-app-authenticate-user-based.md).</p><p>Mass deployment with Microsoft Intune isn't yet supported for user-based authentication, but we expect to add support for it soon. For more information and the latest news about mass deploying to mobile devices for user-based authentication, see [Mass deploy the mobile app with user-based authentication](../warehousing/warehouse-app-intune-user-based.md).</p> |

## Features removed or deprecated in the Supply Chain Management 10.0.35 release

| **Deployment option** | Cloud and on-premises |
| **Status** | <p>Deprecated. As of December 1, 2023, Microsoft will discontinue support for synchronizing contacts, appointments, and tasks between Supply Chain Management and Outlook. In addition, security updates will no longer be provided for these features.</p><p>This functionality is being discontinued because the existing integration is based on SOAP. However, Exchange Web Service (EWS) is transitioning from SOAP to REST and will support only REST going forward. There are no plans to add REST support for Outlook integration in Supply Chain Management.</p><p>As of May 1, 2024, it will no longer be possible to synchronize the following types of records between Supply Chain Management and Outlook:</p><ul><li>Contacts</li><li>Appointment activities</li><li>Task activities</li></ul><p>To prepare for this change, redesign any extensions that you've made to any of these capabilities to remove the dependency.</p><p>To support customer relations management scenarios, consider integrating Dynamics 365 Sales with Outlook and/or using dual-write to synchronize contacts for customer accounts between Supply Chain Management and Dynamics 365 Sales. (For more information, see [Integrated customer master](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/customer-mapping.md).)</p> |

### Use of built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine for manufacturing scenarios

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To enhance performance and minimize the SQL database load during master planning runs, the built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine is being replaced by Planning Optimization. Planning Optimization allows for fast planning runs that can be performed even during office hours. This enables planners to react immediately to changes in demand or planning parameters. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes, Planning Optimization will replace the existing built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Supply Chain Management - Master planning |
| **Deployment option**              | Cloud only. Planning Optimization is not supported with on-premises deployments. |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated. On April 1, 2022, support for manufacturing scenarios was discontinued for the built-in master planning engine for Supply Chain Management. As of that date, Microsoft stopped all active development on manufacturing scenarios for the built-in planning engine, stopped releasing new features, and only released critical bug fixes.  Since that date, all companies that require support for manufacturing scenarios have been required to use Planning Optimization for their master planning calculations. For more information, see [Deprecated master planning overview](../master-planning/deprecated-master-planning-overview.md).<br><br>Since April 2022, only companies with on-premises deployments of Supply Chain Management have been able to continue using the built-in master planning engine for manufacturing scenarios. However, as of March 2023, Microsoft has now fully discontinued all support for the built-in master planning engine for all types of deployments. Hereafter, Microsoft will only provide support for critical blocking issues (which result in no planned orders being created or the continuous failure of built-in master planning). The built-in master planning engine is now referred to as the *deprecated master planning engine*. |

## Features removed or deprecated in the Supply Chain Management 10.0.11 release

### Use of built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine for distribution scenarios

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To enhance performance and minimize the SQL database load during master planning runs, the built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine is being replaced by Planning Optimization. Planning Optimization allows for fast planning runs that can be performed even during office hours. This enables planners to react immediately to changes in demand or planning parameters. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes, Planning Optimization will replace the existing built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Supply Chain Management - Master planning |
| **Deployment option**              | Cloud only. Planning Optimization isn't supported for on-premises deployments. |
