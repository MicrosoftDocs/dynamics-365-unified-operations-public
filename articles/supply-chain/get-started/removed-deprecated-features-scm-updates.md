## Features removed or deprecated in the Supply Chain Management 10.0.11 release

### Use of built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine for distribution scenarios

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To enhance performance and minimize the SQL database load during master planning runs, the built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine is being replaced by Planning Optimization. Planning Optimization allows for fast planning runs that can be performed even during office hours. This enables planners to react immediately to changes in demand or planning parameters. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes, Planning Optimization will replace the existing built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Supply Chain Management - Master planning |
| **Deployment option**              | Cloud only. Planning Optimization is not supported with on-premises deployments. |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated. On April 2021, distribution scenarios will no longer be supported with the built-in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management master planning engine. For distribution scenarios, customers must use Planning Optimization for master planning calculations. For more information, see [Planning Optimization documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2105830). Customers with on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management may continue to use the Supply Chain Management master planning engine for distribution scenarios after April 2021. However, no more feature enhancements will be provided. |
