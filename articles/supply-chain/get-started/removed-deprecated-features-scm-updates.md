As of that date, Microsoft will stop all active development on manufacturing scenarios for the built-in planning engine, will not release any new features, and will only release critical bug fixes. After that date, all companies that require support for manufacturing scenarios must use Planning Optimization for their master planning calculations. Planning Optimization is expected to fully support manufacturing scenarios by October 2022. For more information, see the [Planning Optimization documentation](../master-planning/planning-optimization/planning-optimization-overview.md).<br><br>Companies with on-premises deployments of Supply Chain Management may continue to use the built-in master planning engine for manufacturing scenarios after April 2022.
