It is now replaced by the *Warehouse Management mobile app*, which was released with version 10.0.17 of Supply Chain Management.

### Use of built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine for manufacturing scenarios

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To enhance performance and minimize the SQL database load during master planning runs, the built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine is being replaced by Planning Optimization. Planning Optimization allows for fast planning runs that can be performed even during office hours. This enables planners to react immediately to changes in demand or planning parameters. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes, Planning Optimization will replace the existing built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Supply Chain Management - Master planning |
| **Deployment option**              | Cloud only. Planning Optimization is not supported with on-premises deployments. |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated. On April 1, 2022, support for manufacturing scenarios was discontinued for the built-in master planning engine for Supply Chain Management. As of that date, Microsoft stopped all active development on manufacturing scenarios for the built-in planning engine, stopped releasing new features, and only released critical bug fixes.  Since that date, all companies that require support for manufacturing scenarios have been required to use Planning Optimization for their master planning calculations. For more information, see [Deprecated master planning overview](../master-planning/deprecated-master-planning-overview.md).<br><br>Since April 2022, only companies with on-premises deployments of Supply Chain Management have been able to continue using the built-in master planning engine for manufacturing scenarios. However, as of March 2023, Microsoft has now fully discontinued all support for the built-in master planning engine for all types of deployments. Hereafter, Microsoft will only provide support for critical blocking issues (which result in no planned orders being created or the continuous failure of built-in master planning). The built-in master planning engine is now referred to as the *deprecated master planning engine*. |

## Features removed or deprecated in the Supply Chain Management 10.0.11 release

### Use of built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine for distribution scenarios

| &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | To enhance performance and minimize the SQL database load during master planning runs, the built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine is being replaced by Planning Optimization. Planning Optimization allows for fast planning runs that can be performed even during office hours. This enables planners to react immediately to changes in demand or planning parameters. |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | Yes, Planning Optimization will replace the existing built-in Supply Chain Management master planning engine. |
| **Product areas affected**         | Supply Chain Management - Master planning |

Since then, customers running distribution scenarios have been required to use Planning Optimization for master planning calculations.
