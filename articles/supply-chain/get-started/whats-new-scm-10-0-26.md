## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

If you want to turn any of these features on or off, you must do that in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Module | Feature name in feature management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Procurement and sourcing | Post registered quantities of stocked products and remainders of not-stocked products for receipts and vendor invoices | This feature changes how quantities of not-stocked products (such as services) are posted when processing vendor invoices and inbound shipments against purchase orders. The feature modifies the behavior of the *Registered quantity and services* quantity option for posting receipts and vendor invoices by changing it to match the behavior of the *Registered quantity and not-stocked products* option already provided when posting quantities for sales packing slips.<br><br>When you post a product receipt or vendor invoice using the *Registered quantity and services* quantity option, the system posts the registered quantity of stocked products and posts the remainder quantity of not-stocked products (including both services and non-services). Without this feature, the system still posts the registered quantity of stocked products (including services configured as stocked items) but always posts the full ordered quantity of not-stocked service products (and ignores not-stocked products that are not of type *Service*). |
| Procurement and sourcing | Synchronize tracking dimensions on intercompany sales and purchase order lines | This feature lets you control whether the serial and batch number tracking dimensions are synchronized across intercompany sales and purchase order lines. It adds new settings to both the **Purchase order policies** and **Sales order policies** tabs of the **Intercompany** setup page for customers and vendors. It also updates the names of a few related, nearby settings for clarity.<br><br>If you are using warehouse management processes (WMS), then be aware that this feature will only synchronize batch and serial numbers when those dimensions are above location in the target destination reservation hierarchy. |
| Product information management | Clean up product attribute values | This feature adds a periodic task called **Clean up product attribute values**, which cleans up product attribute value records that are no longer associated with any product via a product category. |
| Inventory and warehouse management | (Russia) Prevent discrepancies when issuing GTDs for purchase orders that include WMS-enabled items | This feature is for Russian localization only. It prevents discrepancies that occur when issuing Russian customs declaration numbers (GTDs) for import purchase orders that include items enabled for warehouse management processes (WMS). The GTD-issuing process changes some inventory dimension values on the related inventory transactions for invoices included in the custom journal, which leads to discrepancies between the work records for the purchase order and the inventory transactions for the purchase. When this feature is enabled, the GTD-issuing process generates adjustment work that eliminates such discrepancies. |
| Warehouse management | Enhanced parser for GS1 barcodes | This feature adds an enhanced parser for GS1 symbol data. The new parser implements the GS1 General Specification algorithm for parsing GS1 symbols and provides stronger data validation. For more information, see [GS1 bar code scanning](../warehousing/gs1-barcodes.md). |
| Warehouse management | New load planning workbench pages | Adds two new load planning workbench pages: **Inbound load planning workbench** and **Outbound load planning workbench**. |
| Warehouse management | Warehouse management application - blank GTD | This feature is for Russian localization only. It allows workers using the Warehouse Management mobile app to leave Russian customs declaration numbers (GTDs) blank when needed. If the GTD tracking dimension is set up to allow blank values, the system will accept blank values for GTD for inventory operations provided on-hand inventory is available. |

### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
