## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2023wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

If you want to turn any of these features on or off, you must do so in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Module | Feature name in feature management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Procurement and sourcing | Purchase order workflow submission and approval performance enhancement | This feature improves the performance of the purchase order workflow submission dialog and approval dialog which is most noticeable on purchase orders with larger number of lines. When this feature is enabled, purchase order totals and accounting distributions are calculated and validated by a workflow execution. Validation errors surface in the workflow history. This feature is not supported when budget control is enabled. |
| Production control | Production batch balancing enhanced onhand grid capability | Provides an enhanced on-hand grid capability for the batch balancing process. |
| Sales and marketing | Prevent updates to intercompany sales order line requested dates in header to lines update scenario when derived. | This feature prevents updating intercompany sales order line requested dates in a header to lines scenario when the intercompany sales order line is created from the purchase order and therefore is derived. Previously, when updating either confirmed or requested dates on the intercompany sales order header, both requested and confirmed sales order line dates would be updated when Transfer settings from the header to the lines ship and receipt dates, update ship and receipt dates, is *Yes*. When this feature is enabled, only the sales order line confirmed dates are updated in such a header to lines update scenario. |

## Feature state changes in this release

The following table lists features that became mandatory or on by default in version 10.0.32. All these features will automatically be turned on for your system as soon as you update to version 10.0.32. Mandatory features can't be turned off, but features that are on by default can still be turned off by using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). Features that are now listed as enabled by default are targeted to become mandatory with 2023 release wave 2.

The table also lists features that were previously in public preview but have changed to become generally available in version 10.0.32. This change indicates that the features are now recommended for use in production environments. These features are turned off by default unless otherwise noted. Therefore, you must use [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) to enable them if you want to use them. Features that are now listed as generally available are targeted to become enabled by default with 2023 release wave 2 and then to become mandatory with 2024 release wave 1.

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
