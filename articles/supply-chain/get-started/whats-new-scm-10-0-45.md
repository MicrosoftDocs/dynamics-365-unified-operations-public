## <a name="enhancements"></a>Feature enhancements added in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that were added in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they're only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2024wave2/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

Some of these features aren't visible on your system until you turn them on in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) using the name listed here for the *Feature management name* (additional configuration may also be needed). Features that don't show a feature management name are visible by default as of this version of Supply Chain Management, but typically add a new configuration option that you need to set to use the new functionality.

| Feature enhancement | Description |
|---|---|
| **Module:** Procurement and sourcing<br><br>**Feature management name:** *Enable calculation of earliest confirmed receipt date for vendor collaboration* | Displays the earliest confirmed receipt date for purchase order responses. The value is calculated based on the confirmed receipt dates for the purchase response lines. |
| **Module:** Procurement and sourcing<br><br>**Feature management name:** *Remove vendors from RFQ after bid is sent or received* | Lets you remove vendors from a request for quotation (RFQ) after a bid has been sent to or received from them. When removing a vendor, you can optionally send an email notification to inform them of the removal. Once removed, the vendor can no longer access the RFQ in the supplier portal. However, the purchase manager can re-add the vendor to the RFQ at any time, as long as the RFQ has not been accepted or rejected. This provides added control and flexibility during the RFQ evaluation process. |
| **Module:** Production control<br><br>**Feature management name:** *Enhanced numpad control for production floor execution interface* | Improves the control that represents the numpad in the production floor execution interface. It changes the control from being an element of type *String* to type *Real*, which makes the decimal separator consistent with regards to the regional settings. |
| **Module:** Shared AP and AR<br><br>**Feature management name:** *Rebate processing use multiple batch tasks* | Enables rebates to be processed in batch with multiple batch tasks running at the same time. |

- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
