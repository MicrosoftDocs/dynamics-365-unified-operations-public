# Register goods shipped to customers (Russia)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In accordance with Russian legislation, a company must register the shipment of goods when goods are transported to a customer. When goods are shipped, ownership of the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer. This transfer of ownership is also referred to as the passing of property rights.
You can also ship goods when the passing of property is postponed to a later date. The customer is liable for the goods only when the passing of property rights occurs.
The following functionality is included:

- Registration of a shipment where there is postponed passing of property rights.

  > [!NOTE:]
  > Although the shipment doesn't change the customer's balance, the supplier must still pay value-added tax (VAT). The goods are moved to a special warehouse for shipped goods.
  
- Registration of a transfer of ownership. This registration includes registration of the customer's debt and write-off of the goods that were sold.
- Cancellation of a shipment where there is postponed passing of property rights.
- Allocation of charges to a sales invoice.
