# Approvals Management mobile app overview

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Many businesses use approval workflows to ensure that new requests (such as proposed purchase requisitions and purchase orders) are valid, within budget, and in line with all business practices and standards. Unfortunately, this extra layer of security can sometimes add delays to the purchasing process. Therefore, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management now provides a mobile approval experience that adds flexibility, efficiency, resiliency, and responsiveness to the approval process.

The Approvals Management mobile app provides the following capabilities for managing approval requests:

- View requests that are assigned to you.
- Approve or deny requests.
- Delegate requests to another approver.
- Ask requesters to make changes.

The following illustration shows an example where the Approvals Management mobile app is being used to manage multiple purchase order requests.
