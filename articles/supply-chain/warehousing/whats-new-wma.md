# What's new or changed in the Warehouse Management mobile app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic lists new features, fixes, improvements, and known issues for each released version of the Warehouse Management mobile app for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## 2.0.7.0

### New features, fixes, and improvements in version 2.0.7.0

- Added a section to the **About** page that checks latest released version of the app.
- Made it easier to flick and swipe between pages.
- Changed the icon for the ascending/descending button on the work list.
- Reduced the margins on the **Details** card to allow it to fit more information.
- Applied various performance improvements to reduce the issue of the app becoming slower over time.
- If there are more controls than fit on the screen, resulting in paging, the spinner control no longer scrolls the same way as the page.
- Prioritize showing the last scanned value over showing the task title, so if they overlap the task title will be truncated.
- Fixed various issues that caused the system to stop responding.
- Text in various places is no longer cut off in some languages.
- The app now runs in full-screen mode by default.
- Fixed an issue that would occasionally cause scans to be ignored on main page with certain devices.

### Known issues in version 2.0.7.0

- On some devices, you will get the following error message when you start the app or begin a task: "Cannot find a suitable view for the specified size." If you see this error message on any of your devices, you must downgrade the Warehouse Management mobile app to version 2.0.6.0 on that device and wait to upgrade until the next version of the app is released.

## Version 2.0.6.0

### New features, fixes, and improvements in version 2.0.6.0

This version introduces the following new features, fixes, and improvements:

- Demo mode now shows all labels in the device language.
- You're less likely to receive the following error message: "Cannot find a suitable view for the specified size."
- The minimum height for work cards has been increased (for cases where three or fewer fields are configured to appear in the work list).
- Margins (fade out) at the bottom of details cards have been improved.
- Invalid symbols in XML files that are exchanged with the server are now handled gracefully. (For example, non-printable characters are now handled gracefully and no longer cause the app to stop responding.)
- HTTP errors (such as "error 503") when a server request is submitted are now handled gracefully.
- While an error is being shown, the options list is no longer automatically shown for combo box controls.
- The app no longer stops responding because of the display orientation that is selected in user settings.
- Product images are now shown in self-service environments. (This change applies to low-resolution versions only. The file management service doesn't support full-sized images in self-service environments.)
- An issue that involved zero-quantity short picks has been fixed.
- The app no longer stops responding when a details card shows multiple identical fields.

### Known issues in version 2.0.6.0

The following known issues exist in this version:

- The app (especially the work list) becomes slower over time.
- **Windows version:** When a USB gun is used for scanning on Windows, inconsistent results cause scanned symbols to be mixed up.
