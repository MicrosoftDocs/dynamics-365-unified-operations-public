# Small parcel shipping

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The small parcel shipping (SPS) feature enables Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to interact directly with shipping carriers by providing a framework for communication through carrier APIs. This functionality is useful when you're shipping individual sales orders via commercial shipping carriers instead of using container shipping or less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping.

The SPS feature interacts with your shipping carrier through a dedicated *rate engine*. Your organization must develop this rate engine in collaboration with your carrier or carrier hub service. The rate engine enables Supply Chain Management to submit details about a packed container to your carrier, and then receive a shipping label, shipping rate, and tracking number back from that carrier.

The shipping rate that is returned is added to the associated sales order as a miscellaneous charge. The shipping label that is returned can then automatically be printed by using a Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) printer and applied to the shipment. The carrier will scan this shipping label when it picks up the packages at your warehouse.

## Prepare your system to support SPS

Before you can start to use SPS functionality, you must turn on the SPS feature in Feature management, add your rate engine, and set up the **Transportation management** and **Warehouse management** modules to support it.

### Turn on the SPS feature

Before you can use the SPS feature, it must be turned on in your system. Administrators can use the [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace to check the status of the feature and turn it on if it's required. There, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Transportation management*
- **Feature name:** *Small parcel shipping*

### Deploy and set up rate engines

Supply Chain Management doesn't include any rate engines. You must obtain or create any rate engines that you require, and then add them to your system. However, Microsoft provides a demo rate engine that you can use for testing.

#### Download and deploy the demo rate engine

Follow these steps to get the demo rate engine.

1. On GitHub, download the [dynamic-link library (DLL) for the demo rate engine](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets/tree/master/SCM/SPS).
1. On your Supply Chain Management server, save the DLL in the 
**\\AOSService\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\ApplicationSuite\\bin** folder.

#### Create and deploy functional rate engines

For information about how to create and deploy functional rate engines so that they can be used in a production or test environment, see the following articles:

- [Create a new transportation management engine](../transportation/create-new-transportation-management-engine.md)
- [Set up transportation management engines](/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-up-transportation-management-engines)

For more information about how to create an SPS rate engine, see the following blog post: [Small Parcel Shipping: How to leverage small parcel shipping functionality in Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://hub.bhsolutions.com/creating-a-mock-parcel-engine-in-d365?submissionGuid=46a1fccf-80b0-4b70-a6a0-4bf45a8756b5).

#### Set up a rate engine in Supply Chain Management

After you've created and deployed a rate engine for SPS, follow these steps to set it up.

1. Go to **Transportation management \> Setup \> Engines \> Rate engine**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a row to the grid.
1. In the new row, set the following fields:

    - **Rating engine** – Enter a unique name for the rate engine. If you're using the demo rate engine, enter *Demo rate engine*.
    - **Name** – Enter a short description of the rate engine. If you're using the demo rate engine, enter *Demo rate engine*.
    - **Rating metadata ID** – Select the basis that should be used to calculate your rate. For example, your rate might be calculated based on distance. If you're using the demo rate engine, you can leave this field blank.
    - **Engine assembly** – Enter the file name of the DLL package that you deployed. If you're using the demo rate engine, enter *TMSSmallParcelShippingEngine.dll*.
    - **Engine class** – Enter the class name that was established for your rate engine. If you're using the demo rate engine, enter *TMSSmallParcelShippingEngine.SmallParcelShippingRateEngine*.

## Example scenario

This example scenario shows how to set up and use SPS after you've prepared your system as described earlier in this article. This scenario uses the previously mentioned demo rate engine.

### Make demo data available

To work through this scenario by using the demo records and values that are specified here, you must be on a system where the standard [demo data](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/demo-data.md) is installed. Additionally, you must select the **USMF** legal entity before you begin.

### Set up the scenario

For this example scenario, you must have a demo carrier, carrier group, packing policy, and packing profile. The following subsections explain how to prepare the records that are required for the scenario. In a production scenario, the setup process typically resembles the process that is described here. However, you will set different values.

#### Set up carriers

Follow these steps to set up a carrier.

1. Go to **Transportation management \> Setup \> Carriers \> Shipping carriers**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a carrier.

1. On the **Work completion** page, in the **User ID** field, select a user ID. Then, on the Action Pane, select **Validate work**.
1. If the work passes validation, select **Complete work** on the Action Pane.

    The work is marked as completed to simulate the movement of items to the packing station.

#### Pack the shipment

Follow these steps to pack the shipment.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Worker**, and make sure that your user account is associated with a worker account for warehouse management.
1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Picking and containerization \> Pack**.
1. In the **Select packing station** dialog box, set the following values:

    - **Site:** *6*
    - **Warehouse:** *62*
    - **Location:** *Pack*
    - **Packing profile ID:** *Demo packing profile*

1. Select **OK**.
1. The **Pack** page appears. In a production scenario, a worker will scan a license plate or shipment ID. However, for this scenario, open the **All shipments** page, and look up the shipment number for the shipment that you just created. Then enter this value in the **License plate or shipment** field on the **Pack** page. Alternatively, enter the shipment ID that you made a note of earlier.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New container**.
1. The dialog box that appears shows details about the new container. Leave the default values, and then select **OK**.
1. On the **Pack** page, on the **Item packing** FastTab, in the **Identifier** field, select *A0002* to pack that item. The item is added to the container.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Containers for shipment**.

    The **Containers for shipment** page that appears has a row for the container that you just created. However, the **Container manifest ID** field in that row is currently blank, because you haven't yet received the shipping label and tracking number from the carrier.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Close container**.
1. In the **Close container** dialog box, set the **Gross weight** field to *1 kg*, and then select **OK**.

    The shipping label should now be printed on the ZPL printer that you selected earlier. It should resemble the following example.

    ![Example shipping label.](media/sps-label-example.png "Example shipping label")

1. Notice that the **Container manifest ID** and **Total freight** values have been added as received from the carrier.
