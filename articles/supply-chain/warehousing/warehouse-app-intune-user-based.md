# Mass deploy the mobile app with user-based authentication

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Automated deployment and configuration of Warehouse Management can be more efficient than manual deployment when you have many devices to manage. One way to achieve this automation is to use a mobile device management (MDM) solution such as [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune). For general information about how to use Intune to add apps, see [Add apps to Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add).

This article explains how to mass deploy the Warehouse Management mobile app with user-based authentication by using Microsoft Intune.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use mobile mass deployment (MDM), you must configure the Warehouse Management mobile app to use [username/password authentication](warehouse-app-authenticate-user-based.md#usernamePasswordFlow) with [single sign-on](warehouse-app-authenticate-user-based.md#sso). This is because it isn't possible to distribute authentication tokens to mobile devices using MDM.

## Prerequisites

To use an MDM solution to deploy the Warehouse Management mobile app and the related authentication certificates, you must have the following resources available:

- Warehouse Management mobile app version 2.0.41.0 or later (This version number applies to all mobile platforms.)
- A valid store account for each mobile platform that you'll support ([Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account/), [Google Account](https://www.google.com/account/about/), and/or [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in))
- [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview) (Microsoft Entra ID Premium P2 license)
- [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#home) (the Intune website)

## Authenticating with or without single sign-on after mass deployment

You can set up user-based authentication for the Warehouse Management mobile app either with or without single sign-on.

- **Without single sign-on** – If you choose to use device code flow authentication, or username/password authentication without single sign-on, then you (or a worker) must authenticate the Warehouse Management mobile app on each device after deploying with MDM.
- **With single sign-on** – If you use username/password authentication with single sign-on, then the Warehouse Management mobile app can authenticate using an existing authentication token on each device, provided the Microsoft Entra ID account required to authenticate the Warehouse Management mobile app is already signed in for another application on the device (such as Microsoft Teams, Company Portal, or Outlook). In this case, no additional authentication may be needed for the device. However, workers may still need to sign in using their warehouse app user account, depending on how you've configured your Microsoft Entra ID and work user accounts (see also [Scenarios for managing devices, Microsoft Entra ID users, and mobile device users]( warehouse-app-authenticate-user-based.md# scenarios).

## Set up the source files for distribution

Each MDM solution offers several methods for sourcing the apps that they deliver to end devices. For example, a solution might use locally stored binary files or fetch binaries from an app store. The preferred method is to use app stores, because it's simple and offers the most convenient way to receive updates.

The following subsections provide examples that show how to set up Intune to fetch apps from the different app stores.

## Manage connection configurations

The Warehouse Management mobile app (version 2.0.41.0 and later) lets you import connection settings as a managed configuration through an MDM solution. The same **ConnectionsJson** configuration key is shared across all platforms.

The following subsections provide examples that show how to set up Intune to provide managed configuration for each of the supported mobile platforms. For more information, see [App configuration policies for Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/app-configuration-policies-overview).

### Create a connection JSON file

As a prerequisite for setting up managed configuration of all mobile platforms, you must create a connection JSON file as described in [Create a connection settings file or QR code](/dynamics365/supply-chain/warehousing/install-configure-warehouse-management-app#create-a-connection-settings-file-or-qr-code). This file enables the mobile app to connect to and authenticate with your Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management environment.

> [!TIP]
> If your JSON file includes more than one connection, one of them should be set as the default connection (by setting the `IsDefaultConnection` parameter to *true* for it). If no default connection is set, the app will prompt the user to manually select an initial connection among the available options.

## Enroll devices with Intune

Each device that you want to manage by using Intune must be *enrolled* with the system. Enrollment involves registering with Intune and applying organizational policies for security. The Company Portal app is accessible on multiple devices and can be used to enroll devices, depending on the type of device and the platform. The enrollment programs provide access to work or school resources.

### Android and iOS devices

To enroll an Android or iOS device, install the [Intune Company Portal app](/mem/intune/user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal) on it. The local user must then sign in to the Company Portal app by using their company account.

### Windows devices

There are several ways to enroll a Windows device. For example, you can install the [Intune Company Portal app](/mem/intune/user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal) on it. For information about how to set up the Company Portal app and how to use the other options that are available, see [Enroll Windows 10/11 devices in Intune](/mem/intune/user-help/enroll-windows-10-device).
