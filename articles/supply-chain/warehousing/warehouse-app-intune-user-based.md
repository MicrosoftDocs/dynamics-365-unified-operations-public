# Mass deploy the mobile app for user-based authentication

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft doesn't currently support mass deployment of the Warehouse Management mobile app when you are using user-based authentication (such as device code flow) to sign in to Supply Chain Management. We expect to add support for this scenario in the near future. [Service-based authentication](warehouse-app-authenticate-service-based.md) has now been deprecated, so user-based authentication will soon be required. We recommend that you use [user-based authentication](warehouse-app-authenticate-user-based.md) for new deployments, and that you migrate existing deployments to user-based authentication as soon as possible. This article will be updated as soon as mass deployment is supported for user-based authentication. For more information about the deprecation of service-based authentication methods, including the deprecation schedule, see [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](../get-started/removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md).
