# Warehouse management

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Warehouse management module for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition lets you manage warehouse processes in manufacturing, distribution, and retail companies. This module has a wide range of features to support the warehouse facility at an optimal level, at any time. Warehouse management is fully integrated with other business processes in Finance and Operations such as transportation, manufacturing, quality control, purchase, transfer, sales, and returns.
