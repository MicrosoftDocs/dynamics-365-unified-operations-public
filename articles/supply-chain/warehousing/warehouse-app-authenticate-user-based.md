# User-based authentication for the Warehouse Management mobile app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Warehouse Management mobile app supports the following types of user-based authentication:

- Device code flow authentication
- Username and password authentication

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All Microsoft Entra ID accounts that are used to sign in must be granted only the minimum set of permissions that they require to perform their warehousing tasks. Permissions should be strictly limited to warehouse mobile device user activities. Never use an admin account to sign in to devices.

## <a name="scenarios"></a>Scenarios for managing devices, Microsoft Entra ID users, and mobile device users

For security purposes, the Warehouse Management mobile app uses Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate the connection between the app and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. There are two basic scenarios for managing Microsoft Entra ID user accounts for your various devices and users: one where each Microsoft Entra ID user accounts represents a unique device and one where each Microsoft Entra ID user represents a unique human worker. In each case, each human worker will have one *warehouse worker* record set up in the Warehouse management module, plus one or more *mobile device user accounts* for each warehouse worker record. For warehouse worker accounts that have more than one mobile device user account, it's possible to make one of them the default mobile device user account. The two scenarios are:

- **Use one Microsoft Entra ID user account for each mobile device** – In this scenario, admins set up the Warehouse Management mobile app to use either [device code flow authentication](#deviceCodeFlow) or [username/password authentication](#usernamePasswordFlow) to connect to Supply Chain Management through the *device's* Microsoft Entra ID account. (In this scenario, human workers don't need a Microsoft Entra ID user account.) The app then shows a sign-in page that lets human workers sign in to the app so they can gain access to the work and other records that apply to them at their location. Human workers sign in by using the user ID and password of one of the mobile device user accounts that are assigned to their warehouse worker record. Because human workers must always enter a user ID, it doesn't matter whether one of the mobile device user accounts is set as the default account for the warehouse worker record. When a human worker signs out, the app remains authenticated with Supply Chain Management but shows the sign-in page again, so that the next human worker can sign in by using their mobile device user account.
- **Use one Microsoft Entra ID user account for each human worker** – In this scenario, each human user has a Microsoft Entra ID user account that's linked to their warehouse worker account in Supply Chain Management. Therefore, the Microsoft Entra ID user sign-in might be all that the human worker needs to both authenticate the app with Supply Chain Management and sign in to the app, provided that a [default user ID](mobile-device-work-users.md#set-wma-users) is set for the warehouse worker account. This scenario also supports [single sign-on](#sso) (SSO), because the same Microsoft Entra ID session can be shared across other apps on the device (such as Microsoft Teams or Outlook) until the human worker signs out of the Microsoft Entra ID user account.

## <a name="deviceCodeFlow"></a>Device code flow authentication

When you use device code authentication, the Warehouse Management mobile app generates and shows a unique device code. The admin who is setting up the device must then enter this device code into an online form, together with the credentials (name and password) for a Microsoft Entra ID user account that represents either the device itself or the human worker who is signing in (depending on how the admin has implemented the system). In some cases, depending on how the Microsoft Entra ID user account is configured, an admin might also have to approve the sign-in. In addition to the unique device code, the mobile app shows the URL where the admin must enter the code and the credentials for the Microsoft Entra ID user account.

Device code authentication simplifies the authentication process, because users don't have to manage certificates or client secrets. However, it introduces a few extra requirements and restrictions:

- You should create a unique Microsoft Entra ID user account for each device or human worker. In addition, *these accounts should be strictly limited so that they can perform only warehouse mobile device user activities*.
- If a generated device code that isn't used for authentication will expire after 15 minutes and the Warehouse Management mobile app will hide it. The user needs to press
*Connect* once more for the mobile app to generate a new code.
- If a device remains [idle for 90 days](/azure/active-directory/develop/refresh-tokens), it's automatically signed out.
- The device code flow isn't supported by mobile mass deployment (MDM) systems such as Intune, as the code is generated the moment one unauthenticated device tries to connect to Supply Chain Management.

## <a name="usernamePasswordFlow"></a>Username/password authentication

When you use username/password authentication, each human worker must enter the Microsoft Entra ID username and password associated either with the device or with themselves (depending on the [authentication scenario](#scenarios) you're using). They might also need to enter a mobile device user account ID and password, depending on their [warehouse worker record setup](mobile-device-work-users.md). This authentication method supports [single sign-on](#sso) (SSO), which also enables mobile mass deployment (MDM).

## <a name="create-service"></a>Create a web service application in Microsoft Entra ID

To enable the Warehouse Management mobile app to interact with a specific Supply Chain Management server, you must register a web service application for the Supply Chain Management tenant in Microsoft Entra ID. The following procedure shows one way to complete this task. For detailed information and alternatives, see the links after the procedure.

1. In a web browser, go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Enter the name and password of the user who has access to the Azure subscription.

## <a name="user-azure-ad"></a>Set up employee, user, and warehouse worker records Supply Chain Management

Before workers can begin to sign in by using the mobile app, each Microsoft Entra ID account that you assigned to the enterprise app in Azure must have a corresponding employee record, user record, and warehouse worker record in Supply Chain Management. For information about how to set up these records, see [Mobile device user accounts](mobile-device-work-users.md).

## <a name="sso"></a>Single sign-on

To use single sign-on (SSO), you must be running Warehouse Management mobile app version 2.1.23.0 or later.

SSO enables users to sign in without having to enter a password. It works by reusing credentials from Intune Company Portal ([Android](/mem/intune/user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal) only), Microsoft Authenticator ([Android](/mem/intune/user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal) and [iOS](/mem/intune/user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal)) or other apps on the device.

> [!NOTE]
> SSO requires that you use [username/password](#usernamePasswordFlow) authentication.

The procedure in [Create a web service application in Microsoft Entra ID](#create-service) describes all the settings that are required to prepare your system to use SSO. However, to use SSO, you must also follow one of these steps, depending on how you configure the connection.

- If you *manually configure the connection* in the Warehouse Management mobile app, you must enable the **Brokered Authentication** option on the mobile app's [**Edit connection** page](install-configure-warehouse-management-app.md#config-manually).
- If you *configure the connection by using a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file or QR code*, you must include `"UseBroker": true` in your [JSON file or QR code](install-configure-warehouse-management-app.md#connection-file-qr).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - To use mobile mass deployment (MDM), you must enable SSO.
> - The Warehouse Management mobile app does *not* support [shared device mode](/entra/identity-platform/msal-shared-devices).

## <a name="revoke"></a>Remove access for a device that uses user-based authentication

If a device is lost or compromised, you must remove its ability to access Supply Chain Management. When a device is authenticated by using the device code flow, it's essential that you disable the associated user account in Microsoft Entra ID to revoke access for that device if it's ever lost or compromised. By disabling the user account in Microsoft Entra ID, you effectively revoke access for any device that uses the device code that's associated with that user account. For this reason, we recommend that you have one Microsoft Entra ID user account per device.

To disable a user account in Microsoft Entra ID, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Microsoft Entra ID**, and ensure that you're in the correct directory.
1. In the **Manage** list, select **Users**.
1. Find the user account that's associated with the device code, and select the name to open the user's profile.
1. On the toolbar, select **Revoke sessions** to revoke the user account's sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on how you set up your authentication system, you might also want to change the user account's password or completely disable the user account.
