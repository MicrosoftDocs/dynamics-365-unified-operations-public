title: Wave template grouping
description: Wave template grouping enables the system to use wave template setups to determine, based on criteria that you define, how it should split released lines and assign them to new or existing waves. This feature can be useful in warehouses where waves are created based on specific criteria, but where managers prefer to create waves automatically instead of manually.

# Wave template grouping

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Wave template grouping enables the system to use [wave template](tasks/configure-wave-processing.md) setups to determine, based on criteria that you define, how it should split released lines and assign them to new or existing waves. This feature can be useful in warehouses where waves are created based on specific criteria, but where managers prefer to create waves automatically instead of manually. It enables the system to add each newly released shipment to the first wave that it finds that has matching grouping field values. If no match is found, the system creates a new wave for the new shipment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wave template grouping isn't supported for the work types *production raw material picking* or *Kanban picking*. This is because wave grouping is based on shipments and these work types don't use shipments.

## Turn on the Wave template grouping feature

Before you can use the *Wave template grouping* feature, it must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on if it's required. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Warehouse management*
- **Feature name:** *Wave template grouping*

## <a name="set-up-template"></a>Set a wave template to use wave template grouping

To make wave template grouping available, follow these steps to set up your [wave template](tasks/configure-wave-processing.md).

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Waves \> Wave templates**.
1. In the left pane, select the wave template to set up. If you're preparing to work through the scenario later in this topic by using demo data, select the **62 Shipping default** template.
1. Select **Edit** to put the page into edit mode.
1. On the **General** FastTab, set the following values:

    - **Automate wave creation:** *Yes*
    - **Assign to open waves:** *Yes*
    - **Process wave at release to warehouse:** *No*

1. On the Action Pane, select **Edit query** to open the query dialog box.
1. In the query dialog box, on the **Sorting** tab, review the sorting criteria, and make sure that there is a rule that includes the field that you want to use to group your waves.

    If you're preparing to work through the scenario by using demo data, add a row that has the following values:

    - **Table:** *Shipments*
    - **Derived table:** *Shipments*
    - **Field:** *Carrier service*

        > [!NOTE]
        > After you select this value, you might receive the following message: "Field Carrier service is not an index field. Do you want to add sorting on this?" Select **Yes** to add sorting.

    - **Search direction:** *Ascending*

1. Select **OK** to save your changes and close the query dialog box.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Wave template grouping**.
1. On the **Wave template grouping** page, select the **Group by** check box for each row that you want to use to group your order lines into waves, as required. If you're preparing to work through the scenario by using demo data, select the **Group by** check box for the *Carrier service* row.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Close the **Wave template grouping** page.
1. Select **Save** to save your template.

## Scenario

This section provides a script that you can work through to learn what this feature does and how to work with it.

### Make sample data available

To work through this scenario by using the sample records and values that are specified here, you must be on a system where the standard [demo data](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/deploy-demo-environment.md) is installed. Additionally, you must select the **USMF** legal entity before you begin.

You can also use this scenario as guidance for using the feature when you work on a production system. However, in that case, you must substitute your own values, and you might be missing some types of required records that the standard demo data provides.

### Scenario: Wave template grouping

This scenario shows how to use wave template grouping to automatically create multiple waves, based on grouping criteria that are defined in a wave template. In this scenario, the wave template is set up in the system to create one wave per carrier service.

Before you begin, prepare your wave template as described in the [Set a wave template to use wave template grouping](#set-up-template) section earlier in this topic. If you will be working with demo data for this scenario, be sure to use the demo data values that are suggested in that procedure. This setup will group your waves according to the carrier service that is set for each sales order.
