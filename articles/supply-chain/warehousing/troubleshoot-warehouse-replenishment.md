# Troubleshoot warehouse replenishment

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to fix common issues that you might encounter while you work with warehouse replenishment in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## I receive the following error message: "Work %1 cannot be unblocked because it has unfinished replenishment work."

### Issue description

Picking work is blocked because of dependent replenishment work.

### Issue resolution

When you use wave demand replenishment, if a picking location must be replenished to fulfill the source order demand, the system creates both the replenishment work and the picking work. However, it blocks the picking work until the replenishment work is completed. This behavior is intentional, because the picking location won't have enough inventory unless the replenishment work is completed. Complete the replenishment work, and then process the picking work.
