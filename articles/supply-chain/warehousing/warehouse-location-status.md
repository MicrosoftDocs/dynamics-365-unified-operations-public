# Warehouse location status

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes several location fields that give you flexibility when you work with and maintain locations. You can include location statuses in the location directive query to provide better control over warehouse flow.

The following four fields on the **Locations** page track information about the current status of a location. These fields let warehouse managers get an overview of the status of the warehouse locations. They also allow for advanced reporting and filtering.

- **Item number** – The item that is currently in the location. If the location contains multiple items, this field is blank.
- **Last activity date and time** – The timestamp of the last warehouse transaction that was performed against the location.
- **Aging date** – The date when the inventory in the location was brought into the warehouse. This value is calculated based on the aging date of the license plate. It's accurate for locations that are license plate–tracked, but it might not be accurate for locations that aren't license plate–tracked.
- **Location status** – The status of the location. There are four possible values:

    - **Undetermined** – The location profile can't track status. Therefore, the current status is unknown.
    - **Empty** – There is currently no inventory in the location.
    - **Picking** – Outbound transactions have been performed against the location since it was last empty.
    - **Storage** – Only inbound transactions have been performed against the location since the location was last empty.

## Turn on the Warehouse location status feature

Before you can use the *Warehouse location status* feature, it must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on if it's required. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Warehouse management*
- **Feature name:** *Warehouse location status*

## Set up warehouse location status

### Prepare the sample data that is required for the example scenario

Before you start to work through the scenario, you must activate sample data and set up the feature as described in this section. To complete the example scenario, you must use either the warehouse app or the browser-based emulator. The steps that are provided here use the warehouse app. The steps for the browser-based emulator are similar.

#### Use the USMF legal entity

To work through the example scenario by using the sample records and values that are specified here, you must be on a system where the standard [demo data](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/deploy-demo-environment.md) is installed. Additionally, you must select the **USMF** legal entity before you begin.

#### Set up location profiles

The example scenario requires that you prepare two location profiles.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Warehouse \> Location profiles**.
1. Select **Edit** to put the page into edit mode.
1. Select the **BULK-06** profile.
1. On the **General** FastTab, set the following values:

    - **Enable item in location:** Set this option to _Yes_.
    - **Enable location activity date and time:** Set this option to _Yes_.
    - **Enable location status:** Set this option to _Yes_.

    These options control whether the reference fields on the location are active.

1. Repeat steps 3 through 4 for the **PICK-06** profile.

### Scenario

1. Select **New**.

    - **Item number:** _A0002_
    - **Quantity:** _5_

1. On the Action Pane, on the **Purchase** tab, in the **Actions** group, select **Confirm** to confirm the purchase order.
