# Additional location zones

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Three new zone fields are available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. Warehouse managers can use them to define additional warehouse organizations or layouts. The new zone fields can be set either manually or by using the **Location setup** wizard. They can be used in any query or filtering that uses the Locations table.

No additional setup is required to use the zone fields.

## Turn on the Additional location zone feature

Before you can use the *Additional location zone* feature, it must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on if it's required. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Warehouse management*
- **Feature name:** *Additional location zone*

## Use location zones

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Warehouse \> Location setup wizard**.
2. Set the following values:

    - In the **Warehouse** field, select _62_.
    - In the **Zone ID** field, select _FLOOR_.
    - In the **Additional Zone 1** field, select _PICKZONE1_.
    - In the **Additional Zone 2** field, select _WEBSHOP1_.
    - In the **Location profile ID** field, select _FLOOR_.

3. Select the **Floor** line.
4. In the **From number** field, enter _1_. In the **To number** field, enter _3_.
5. Select the **Aisle** line.
6. In the **From number** field, enter _1_. In the **To number** field, enter _5_.
7. Select **Create**.
8. You receive messages that state that new locations have been added. Select the **Show messages** button to view the messages.
9. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Warehouse \> Locations**. The new locations appear in the list, and all zone fields are available (that is, the existing zone field and the new additional zone fields).
