# Set up manual packing (February & May 2016 only)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

The packing process allows you to validate and pack products into containers. In this process, warehouse workers pick products from the storage locations and move them to a packing station where they check the item quantities and types, and assign them to appropriate containers. When a container is fully packed, they can close it and move it to the outbound docks, and the products are ready to ship. This procedure uses the USMF demo company.
