# Create a location profile

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

Every location in the warehouse needs to have a location profile associated with it that describes the properties of the location, for example, whether the location allows mixed items. In this procedure we’ll create a profile for a location that doesn’t require license plate control. We’ll enable mixed items, and mixed inventory statuses, and allow cycle counting. You can use this procedure in the USMF demo data company.

1. Click New.
2. In the Location profile ID field, type a value.
3. In the Name field, type a value.
4. In the Location format field, enter or select a value.
5. In the Location type field, enter or select a value.
6. In the Dock management profile ID field, enter or select a value.
7. Select Yes in the Allow mixed items field.
8. Select Yes in the Allow mixed  inventory statuses field.
9. Select Yes in the Allow cycle counting field.
10. Click Save.
11. Go to Warehouse management > Setup > Warehouse > Location profiles.
