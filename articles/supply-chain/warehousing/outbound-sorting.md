# Outbound sorting

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This functionality makes it easier to handle small containers and helps warehouse workers better plan and organize pallet capacity in the truck. When you use outbound sorting, you can sort packed containers to the correct pallet after they have been at a packing station. You can also build a packing hierarchy.

This functionality lets you build pallets from containers that are packed through the packing functionality. The container isn't sent to the final shipping location as it is in the original packing flow. Instead, workers can close the container and move it to a sort type location. They can then sort containers to positions, each of which has a license plate (LP). After the containers have been sorted, work can be created to send the whole LP to the final shipping dock or stage locations, based on location directives or your own requirements. Additionally, the action of closing of the sort position can immediately move the inventory to the final shipping location and pick it to the order.

## Turn on the Outbound sorting feature

Before you can use the feature, it must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace to check the status of the feature and turn it on if it's required. There, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Warehouse management*
- **Feature name:** *Outbound sorting*

## Setup

For this scenario, you must use standard **USMF** demo data and warehouse *62*. You must also complete the setup that is described in the following subsections.

### Set up a wave template

This setup automatically processes the wave and creates work when a line is released to the warehouse.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Waves \> Wave templates**.
1. In the template list, select **Warehouse 62**.
1. On the **General** FastTab, make sure that the **Process wave at release to warehouse** option is set to *Yes*.

### Set up a worker

The packing station is considered a location. Warehouse workers who sign in at the packing station see and work on only shipments and containers that are planned at that specific packing location. A user who signs in to Microsoft Dynamics 365 must be set up as a worker in Warehouse management. If the user's name doesn't appear in the list of work users, use the following procedure to add it.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps assume that the user already exists in the system and has been associated as an employee or worker in the **Human Resources** module.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Worker**.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Worker** field, select the target user in the list of employees.
1. Select **Select**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.
1. On the **Users** FastTab, select **New** to create a mobile device account, and set the following values for it:

    - **User ID:** Enter a unique ID.
    - **User name:** Enter a name for the ID.
    - **Default warehouse:** *62*
    - **Menu name:** *Main*

1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.
1. The **Set password** dialog box appears, where you can create a simple password that the user can use to sign in to the mobile app. Set the following values:

    - **Password:** Enter a simple password.
    - **Confirm password:** Enter the same password again.

1. Select **Set password**.

    A notification in the Action Center informs you that the password has been set for the user that you created.

### Create a location type

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Warehouse \> Location types**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to create a location type, and set the following values for it:

    - **Location type:** *SORT*
    - **Description:** *Sort*

1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

### Set up Warehouse management parameters

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Warehouse management parameters**.
1. On the **General** tab, on the **Location types** FastTab, set the **Sorting location type** field to *SORT*.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

    - **Warehouse:** *62*
    - **Location:** *SORT*
    - **Location profile ID:** *SORTING*

1. Select **Save**.

### Set up an outbound sorting template

The outbound sorting template determines whether work is created out of the sort location, and whether sorting is done manually or automatically.

For this scenario, you will create an outbound sorting template to build pallets after the packing station.

1. Go to **Warehouse Management \> Setup \> Packing \> Outbound sorting template**.

To view the container details, go to **Warehouse management \> Packing and containerization \> Containers**, and search for the container IDs that were created during packing.

### Sort the containers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you access the **Pallet build** menu item on the mobile app to do outbound sorting, you will see a button that is labeled **Full**. *Don't use the **Full** button to sort or close the position.*
>
> The **Full** button is provided by default and can't be disabled or removed from the page. It isn't used for the *Outbound sorting* feature.

#### Sort the first container

1. On the mobile device, sign in to warehouse *62* by using the user ID that you created for this scenario (or the user ID of an existing demo data user).
1. On the main menu, select **Outbound**.
1. On the **Outbound** menu, select **Pallet build**.
1. In the **LP/Con** field, enter the first container ID that is associated with sales order 1.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Because no sort positions currently exist, you must specify one. In the **Sort position ID** field, enter *SP01*.
1. Because no LP is currently associated with sort position *SP01*, you must specify one. In the **LP** field, enter *PLP01*.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Because sort position validation is turned on, you must enter the sort position ID again. In the **Sort Position ID** field, enter *SP01*.
1. Select **OK**.

    You receive a "Work completed" message.

> [!TIP]
> To view the sort position and the LP in it, go to **Warehouse management \> Packing and containerization \> Outbound sorting position assignments**.
>
> The **Outbound sorting position assignments** page shows all the sort positions that are currently active. The **Sort position transactions** field shows the LP that is associated with each sort position, and the containers that are in the sort position. Notice that one sort position currently exists, and that the **Sort position criteria** FastTab shows a criterion of **Shipment – Carrier service - Air**.

#### Sort the remaining containers

1. On the mobile device, sign in to warehouse *62* by using the user ID that you created for this scenario (or the user ID of an existing demo data user).
1. On the main menu, select **Outbound**.
1. On the **Outbound** menu, select **Pallet build**.
1. In the **LP/Con** field, enter the second container ID that is associated with sales order 1.
1. Select **OK**. Because the sorting template is set up to sort automatically, and a sort position that has matching criteria already exists, you're automatically directed to the correct sort position.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Confirm the sort position ID to indicate that the inventory is in the correct place. In the **Sort Position ID** field, enter *SP01*.
1. Select **OK**.

    Work is completed on the second container from sales order 1. You will now sort the remaining containers from sales order 2.

1. In the **LP/Con** field, enter the container ID of the container from sales order 2 that holds item *A0001*. Because the carrier service differs, you're prompted to enter a new sort position and assign an LP to that position. Use sort position *SP02* and LP *PLP02*.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Confirm the sort position by entering *SP02* in the **Sort Position ID** field.
1. Select **OK**.

    Work is completed on the container.

1. In the **LP/Con** field, enter the container ID for the remaining container from sales order 2 that holds item *A0002*. Because the carrier service is the same as the carrier service for sales order 1, the system shows the existing sort position that has matching criteria.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Confirm the sort position by entering *SP01* in the **Sort Position ID** field.
1. Select **OK**.

    Work is completed on the container.

### Close the outbound sorting positions

When all inventory has been sorted, the position must be closed before work can be created. Sorted inventory picking work will be created to take the inventory to the bay door.

#### Close a position from the mobile device

1. On the mobile device, sign in to warehouse *62* by using the user ID that you created for this scenario (or the user ID of an existing demo data user).

1. In the **LP/Con** field, enter a container ID that was sorted to sort position *SP01*.
1. Select **OK**.
1. You receive the following message: "The container is already sorted to position SP01. Close the position?" Select **Close**.

    Work is completed.

#### Close a position from outbound sorting position assignments

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Packing and containerization \> Outbound sorting position assignments**.
1. In the left column, select **SP02**. This outbound sorting position row is the one that you will close.

    > [!TIP]
    > To show all closed position records, select the **Show closed** check box.
