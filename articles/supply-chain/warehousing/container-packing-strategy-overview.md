# Container packing strategies

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A *container packing strategy* is a strategy that you can use to define item allocations across containers. This article explains the differences between the *Pack into all open containers* and *Pack into current container only* strategies.

- **Pack into all open containers** – The system must check all open containers that have already been created during the containerization cycle, to make sure that the item will fit into one of them. During packing, the system checks each item to determine whether it will fit into any of the previously created containers. If the item won't fit into an existing container, the system creates a new container and continues until it has finished packing the whole order.

    For example, *n* ordered items require containerization. In the worst case, every time that the system processes an item that doesn't fit into any existing container, it will do a total of (\[(*n* – 1) × (*n* + 1)\] ÷ 2) checks to evaluate whether the item fits into the existing containers.

- **Pack into current container only** – The system must check only the most recently created container to make sure that the item will fit into it. During packing, the system checks each item to determine whether it will fit into the most recently created container. If the item won't fit into that container, the system creates a new container and continues until it has finished packing the whole order.

    For example, *n* ordered items require containerization. In the worst case, the system will do a total of (*n* – 1) checks to evaluate whether the item fits into the containers.

## Example of the flow for container packing strategies

You set up the following items for containerization.

| Item | Physical dimensions (width × depth × height) | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| HDMI Cable 6' | 1 × 1 × 1 | 1 |
| HDMI Cable 12' | 2 × 1 × 1 | 1 |
| HDMI Cable 18' | 3 × 1 × 1 | 2 |

You also set up the following box that will be used for packaging.

| Container | Physical dimensions (length × width × height) | Weight | Volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medium Box | 6 × 3 × 2 | 10 | 100 |

Finally, you set up an order that has the following products and quantities.

| Sales order line | Quantity |
|---|---|
| HDMI Cable 12' | 9 |
| HDMI Cable 18' | 8 |
| HDMI Cable 6' | 13 |

The following table summarizes how containerization works when you use the *Pack into all open containers* strategy and when you use the *Pack into current container only* strategy.

| Pack into all open containers | Pack into current container |
|---|---|
| <p>HDMI Cable 12':</p><ol><li>Create a new container, CONT0001.</li><li>Put 9 ea into container CONT0001.</li></ol> | <p>HDMI Cable 12':</p><ol><li>Create a new container, CONT0001.</li><li>Put 9 ea into container CONT0001.</li></ol> |
| <p>HDMI Cable 18':</p><ol><li>Check whether the item can fit into container CONT0001.</li><li>Create a new container, CONT0002.</li><li>Put 5 ea into container CONT0002.</li><li>Create a new container, CONT0003.</li><li>Put 3 ea into container CONT0003.</li></ol> | <p>HDMI Cable 18':</p><ol><li>Check whether the item can fit into container CONT0001.</li><li>Create a new container, CONT0002.</li><li>Put 5 ea into container CONT0002.</li><li>Create a new container, CONT0003.</li><li>Put 3 ea into container CONT0003.</li></ol> |
| <p>HDMI Cable 6':</p><ol><li>Check whether the item can fit into container CONT0001.</li><li>Put 1 ea into container CONT0001.</li><li>Check whether the item can fit into container CONT0002.</li><li>Check whether the item can fit into container CONT0003.</li><li>Put 4 ea into container CONT0003.</li><li>Create a new container, CONT0004.</li><li>Put 8 ea into container CONT0004.</li></ol> | <p>HDMI Cable 6':</p><ol><li>Check whether the item can fit into container CONT0003.</li><li>Put 4 ea into container CONT0003.</li><li>Create a new container, CONT0004.</li><li>Put 9 ea into container CONT0004.</li></ol> |

## Example scenario: Pack single orders per container

This section presents a scenario where the system is set up to consolidate multiple orders into one shipment. Therefore, containerization will be done from the sales order to ensure that every order that contains multiple products is packed into its own container.

This functionality lets you handle scenarios where you must pack only one sales order into each container, so that the distribution center can cross-dock full containers between retail stores. In addition to the retail scenarios (order per retail store and shipping to a distribution center for cross-docking) this technique is also commonly used in lean supply chains (sales order per just-in-time production line).

This scenario shows how you can decrease the number of containers that are evaluated during packing by using the *Pack into current container only* strategy for containerization.

### Prerequisites

#### Turn on the Consolidate shipments feature in your system

This scenario uses the *Consolidate shipments* feature. If that feature isn't already available in your system, you must turn it on by using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

#### Make demo data available

This scenario references values and records that are included in the standard demo data that is provided for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. If you want to use the values that are provided here as you do the exercises, be sure to work in an environment where the demo data is installed, and set the legal entity to **USMF** before you begin.

### Inspect or create container types

To inspect your container types, or to create new container types if they are required, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Containers** \> **Container types**.
1. Make sure that each of the following container types is available in your demo data. Edit or create container types as required.

    - Container type 1:

        - **Container type code:** *Box-Large*
        - **Description:** *Large Box*
        - **Maximum net weight:** *100*
        - **Volume:** *400*
        - **Length:** *4*
        - **Width:** *10*
        - **Height:** *10*

    - Container type 2:

        - **Container type code:** *Box-Medium*
        - **Description:** *Medium Box*
        - **Maximum net weight:** *50*
        - **Volume:** *200*
        - **Length:** *2*
        - **Width:** *10*
        - **Height:** *10*

    - Container type 3:

        - **Container type code:** *Box-Small*
        - **Description:** *Small Box*
        - **Maximum net weight:** *20*
        - **Volume:** *100*
        - **Length:** *1*
        - **Width:** *10*
        - **Height:** *10*

### Inspect or create container groups

To inspect your container groups, or to create new container groups if they are required, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Containers** \> **Container groups**.
1. Make sure that the following container group is available in your demo data. If it isn't available, select **New** to create it.

    - **Container group ID:** *Boxes*
    - **Description:** *Box sizes*

1. On the **Details** FastTab for the *Boxes* container group, make sure that the following lines exist. If they don't, select **New** to add them.

    - Line 1:

        - **Sequence number:** *1*
        - **Container type:** *Box-Large*
        - **Container utilization percentage:** *100*

    - Line 2:

        - **Sequence number:** *2*
        - **Container type:** *Box-Medium*
        - **Container utilization percentage:** *100*

    - Line 3:

        - **Sequence number:** *3*
        - **Container type:** *Box-Small*
        - **Container utilization percentage:** *100*

### Create a new container build template

To create a new container build template, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Containers** \> **Container build template**.
1. Select **New** to create a container build template that has the following settings:

    - **Sequence number:** *1*
    - **Container template ID:** *Box*
    - **Container group ID:** *Boxes*
    - **Base query types:** *Sales allocation line*
    - **Wave step code:** *234*
    - **Allow split picks:** *Yes*
    - **Container packing strategy:** *Pack into current container only*
    - **Pack by directive unit:** *No*

1. While the row for the new template is still selected, select **Edit query** on the Action Pane.
1. A standard query editor dialog box appears. On the **Sorting** tab, select **Add** to add a row that has the following settings:

    - **Table:** *Temporary work transactions*

    - **Field:** *Order number*
    - **Search direction:** *Ascending*

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To avoid cycling over all the other open containers, and to speed up the process by checking one container at a time, use the *Pack into current container only* strategy in addition to sorting by order number. This combination will work like a work break on a work template.

1. Select **OK** to close the query editor dialog box.
1. While the row for the new template is still selected, select **Container mixing constraints** on the Action Pane.

    You will now add a constraint that puts items from a single order into a single container. Items from any other order will be put into a separate container.

1. Select **New** to create a mixing constraint that has the following settings:

    - **Table:** *Sales orders*
