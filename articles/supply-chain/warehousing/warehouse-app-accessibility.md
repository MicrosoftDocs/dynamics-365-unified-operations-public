# Warehouse Mobile app accessibility features

The Warehouse Management mobile app is designed for accessibility, to help ensure that all workers can effectively interact with the app. This article describes the accessibility features of the Warehouse Management mobile app.

## Font and button scaling

Font and button scaling helps ensure that the Warehouse Management mobile app remains worker-friendly and accessible to many workers, including workers who have visual impairments.

- **Font Scaling** – The app supports font scaling from 50 to 400 percent. Therefore, workers can adjust the text size according to their preference. This flexibility helps ensure that workers can comfortably read and interact with the app's content, regardless of their visual acuity. The font size in the app is independent of the operating system's font settings. Therefore, workers can set font sizes in the app that differ from the font sizes on their device, for a more personalized experience.
- **Button Scaling** – The app supports button scaling from 50 to 200 percent. Therefore, workers can adjust the size of buttons and other interactive elements in the app. This flexibility helps worker more easily tap and interact with the app's functionality.

## Multiple color themes

The Warehouse Management mobile app lets workers select among multiple color themes. This flexibility helps ensure a comfortable and accessible experience for everyone, including workers who have visual impairments or specific color preferences. The app supports the following four color themes:

- **Auto** – This theme matches the operating system settings for your device.
- **Light** – This theme features a light background and dark text. It's designed to provide a clean and easy-to-read interface for workers who prefer a bright appearance.
- **Dark** – This theme features a dark background and light text. It's designed to reduce eye strain for workers who prefer a more subdued color scheme, especially in low-light environments.
- **High-contrast white** – This high-contrast theme features a white background, bold black text, and high-contrast colors for interactive elements. It's designed to enhance readability for workers who have visual impairments, or who require a higher level of contrast to comfortably read text and interact with the app.
- **High-contrast black** – This high-contrast theme features a black background, white text, and high-contrast colors for interactive elements. It's designed to enhance readability and improve accessibility for workers who have visual impairments, or who require a higher level of contrast.

## Choice of button positions

The Warehouse Management mobile app offers customizable button positions. Therefore, workers can tailor the app's interface to their needs and preferences. The app supports the following four button positions:

- **Top-left** – Buttons appear in the upper-left corner of the screen. This option caters to workers who prefer to interact with the app by using their left hand, or who find this position more comfortable or convenient.
- **Top-right** – Buttons appear in the upper-right corner of the screen. This option caters to workers who prefer to interact with the app by using their right hand, or who find this position more comfortable or convenient.
- **Bottom-left** – Buttons appear in the lower-left corner of the screen. This option caters to workers who prefer to interact with the app by using their left hand, or who find this position more comfortable or convenient.
- **Bottom-right** – Buttons appear in the lower-right corner of the screen. This option caters to workers who prefer to interact with the app by using their right hand, or who find this position more comfortable or convenient.

## Screen reader support

The Warehouse Management mobile app is accessible on three major platforms: Android, iOS, and Windows. To help provide a seamless experience for workers who have visual impairments, it supports (and the support is limited to) the following platform-specific screen readers:

- **Android TalkBack** – TalkBack is a preinstalled screen reader on Android devices that provides spoken feedback to help workers navigate and interact with their devices.
- **Windows Narrator** – Narrator is an integrated screen reader for Windows devices that reads out text on the screen.
- **iOS VoiceOver** – VoiceOver is a built-in screen reader on iOS devices that provides spoken feedback.

By supporting these screen readers, the Warehouse Management mobile app helps ensure that workers who have visual impairments can effectively access and interact with the app, regardless of their platform.
