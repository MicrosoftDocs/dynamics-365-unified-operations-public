# Check Wi-Fi connectivity and performance

This article explains how to use the network diagnostics tool in the Warehouse Management mobile app to test your Wi-Fi connection. The tool is especially helpful when experiencing connection problems or slow performance. Use it to detect network issues and share results with the Microsoft support or development team during troubleshooting.

## What the network diagnostics tool does

The network diagnostics tool runs a series of tests to check your Wi-Fi connection. Based on the results, it shows key details such as:

- Wi-Fi network name
- Connection status
- Connection speed
- Signal strength
- IP address
- Download speed

If you're having trouble with your network connection, these results can help the Microsoft support or development team understand what went wrong.

## Run a network diagnostic test

To run a network diagnostic test, follow these steps:

1. Open the Warehouse Management mobile app on the device where you're having trouble.
1. Do one of the following steps:
    - On the **Welcome** page, select **Set up connection** (or select **Connect** and then select **Set up connection**).
    - On the **Main menu** page, select **Connection settings** and then select **Set up connection**.
1. On the **Connection setup** pop-up menu, select **Diagnostics**.
1. On the **Diagnostics** page, select **Analyze Wi-Fi**.
