# Troubleshoot inbound warehouse operations

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to fix common issues that you might encounter while you work with inbound warehouse operations in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## I receive the following error message: "Quality order %1 has been generated. Cluster profile could not be found please check your configuration."

### Issue description

This error message is related to a receiving process where quality management (QMS) is turned on. Depending on the configurations in your environment, additional details about the transaction that is generating the error message might help fix the issue.

### Issue resolution

First, review the [cluster picking](set-up-cluster-picking.md) setup, and make sure that your cluster profiles are set up correctly. You can't use a mobile device menu item for cluster picking unless cluster profiles are set up. Depending on your environment, you might also have to review other related configurations.

## Mixed license plate receiving doesn't work for any disposition code except Credit.

### Issue description

When the **Action** field for a disposition code is set to *Credit* or *Scrap*, you can use only the [Mixed license plate receiving](mixed-license-plate-receiving.md) menu item to process returned items.

### Issue resolution

Microsoft has evaluated this issue and has determined that it's a feature limitation. Currently, only [disposition codes](../service-management/set-up-disposition-codes.md) where the **Action** field is set to *Credit* or *Scrap* are supported for mixed license plate receiving.

## When I run the Update product receipts periodic task, unconfirmed purchase orders are confirmed.

### Issue description

After you run the *Update product receipts* periodic task, the system automatically confirms unconfirmed purchase orders that have an inventory transaction status of *Registered*.

### Issue resolution

A new inbound load handling feature, *Over receipt of load quantities*, fixes this issue. To turn on this feature, go to the [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace and turn on the following features (in the order that they are listed in):

1. Associate purchase order inventory transactions with load
1. Over receipt of load quantities

For more information, see [Post registered product quantities against purchase orders](inbound-load-handling.md#post-registered-quantities).

## When I register inbound orders, I receive the following error message: "The quantity is not valid."

### Issue description

If the **License plate grouping policy** field is set to *User defined* for a mobile device menu item that is used to register inbound orders, you receive an error message ("The quantity is not valid"), and you can't complete the registration.

### Issue cause

When *User defined* is used as a license plate grouping policy, the system splits the incoming inventory into separate license plates, as indicated by the unit sequence group. If batch or serial numbers are used to track the item that is being received, the quantities of each batch or serial must be specified per license plate that is registered. If the quantity that is specified for a license plate exceeds the quantity that must still be received for the current dimensions, you receive the error message.

### Issue resolution

When you register an item by using a mobile device menu item where the **License plate grouping policy** field is set to *User defined*, the system might require that you confirm or enter license plate numbers, batch numbers, or serial numbers.

On the license plate confirmation page, the system will show the quantity that is allocated for the current license plate. On the batch or serial confirmation pages, the system will show the quantity that must still be received on the current license plate. It will also include a field where you can enter the quantity to register for that combination of license plate and batch or serial number. In this case, make sure that the quantity that is being registered for the license plate doesn't exceed the quantity that must still be received.

Alternatively, if too many license plates are being generated on inbound order registration, the value of the **License plate grouping policy** field can be changed to *License plate grouping*, a new unit sequence group can be assigned to the item, or the **License plate grouping** option for the unit sequence group can be inactivated.
