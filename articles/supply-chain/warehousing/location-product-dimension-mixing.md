# Location product dimension mixing

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Location product dimension mixing is location profile functionality that helps improve location management when product variants or products that have dimensions are used, such as in the fashion industry. It lets you decide whether configurations, colors, styles, and sizes can be mixed for a specific location profile, or whether just one of these dimensions or a combination of them can be put to the same location.

## Turn on the Location product dimension mixing feature

Before you can use location product dimension mixing, the feature must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace to check the status of the feature and turn it on if it's required. There, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Warehouse management*
- **Feature name:** *Location product dimension mixing*

## Setup

Every location in the warehouse needs to have a location profile associated with it that describes the properties of the location. Therefore, all locations that use the same location profile will be able to allow product dimension mixing after it has been set up.

### Configure location profiles to allow product dimension mixing

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Warehouse \> Location profiles**.
1. In the list of location profiles, select **BULK**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Edit**.
1. On the **General** FastTab, set the **Enable location product dimension specific mixing** option to *Yes*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can set this option to *Yes* only if the **Allow mixed items** option is set to *No*.

1. On the **Allowed product dimension mixing** FastTab, set the **Size** option to *Yes*. In the scenario that is described in this topic, mixing can be done only for products that have different **Size** dimensions. However, other options are also available.
1. Select **Save**.

### Create a new product master and product variants

1. Go to **Product information management \> Products \> Product masters**.

    - **Product subtype:** *Product master*
    - **Product number:** *B0001*

## Scenario

This demo scenario shows how two different product variants can be put to the same location when the location profile doesn't allow for mixed items, but the *Location product dimension mixing* feature is enabled. In this case, you will use the **Size** variant as the criterion.

Before you begin, make sure that there are empty locations in warehouse *24* that use the *BULK* location profile.

### Create a purchase order

You will create a purchase order that has three lines: two lines for the same product number but different **Size** variants, and a third line for a different product that has no variants.

1. Go to **Accounts payable \> Purchase orders \> All purchase orders**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
1. In the **Create purchase order** dialog box, set the following values:

    - **Vendor account:** *1001*
    - **Warehouse:** *24*

1. Select **OK**.
1. The purchase order is created, and a new line is added on the **Purchase order lines** FastTab. Make a note of the purchase order number.
1. On the new line, set the following values:

    - **Item number:** *B0001*
    - **Size** *L*
    - **Quantity:** *2*

1. Select **Add line** above the grid to add a second purchase order line, and set the following values:

    - **Item number:** *B0001*
    - **Size** *XL*
    - **Quantity:** *2*

1. Select **Add line** to add a third purchase order line, and set the following values:

    - **Item number:** *A0001*
    - **Quantity:** *1*

1.Select **Save**.

### Receive purchase order lines in the warehouse app

1. Sign in to the warehouse app as a user who is enabled for warehouse *24*.
1. Select the **Inbound** menu.
1. Select **PO Line receiving**.
1. Select the **PONUM** field, and then enter the purchase order number.
1. Confirm your entry by selecting the confirm button ( ✔ ) at the bottom of the page.
1. Enter the line number from the purchase order that is being received. Select the **LINENUM** field, and then use the number pad to enter *1*.
1. Confirm your entry.
1. Enter the quantity to receive. Select the plus sign (**+**) button two times to increase the value in the **Qty** field to *2*.
1. Register your entry by selecting the button ( ✔ ) at the bottom of the page, and then confirm your entry by selecting the button ( ✔ ) again.
1. View the information on the **Purchase orders: Put** page. This page shows the work that has been created for the put-away (Work 1).

    The location where the received item will be put away, the license plate, the item, the size, and the quantity of the **PO Line receiving** task that you just completed are shown.

1. Confirm the put-away work.
1. Repeat the steps 4 through 11 for the purchase order line 2. However, in step 8, specify a quantity of *1*.

    New put-away work (Work 2) is created for the same location as Work 1.

1. Repeat the steps 4 through 11 again for purchase order line 2. In step 8, specify the remaining quantity of *1*.

    New put-away work (Work 3) is created for the same location as Work 1 and Work 2. This behavior occurs because the *Consolidate* location directive strategy is used, and the **Allowed product dimension mixing** FastTab on the *Bulk* **Location profiles** setup allows the **Size** variant to be mixed on a location.

1. Repeat the steps 4 through 11 for purchase order line 3. In step 8, specify a quantity of *1* for item number *A0001*.

    New put-away work (Work 4) is created for a different location than the location that is used for purchase order lines 1 and 2. This behavior occurs because the location profile doesn't allow for mixed products, but it does allow for mixed dimensions of the same product master.

1. Select the Menu button at the top of the page (sometimes referred to as the hamburger or the hamburger button), and then select **Cancel** to exit **PO Line receiving**.

> [!TIP]
> You can repeat this scenario, but this time, set **Size** - *No* under the **Allow product dimension mixing** FastTab on the *BULK* **Location profiles**, so that none of the product dimensions can be mixed. In this case, when you receive the purchase order, each product variant will be put to a new location.
