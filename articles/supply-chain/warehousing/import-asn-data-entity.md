# Import inbound ASNs through the V3 data entity

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Advanced shipping notices (ASNs) notify you about vendor deliveries. They help the sender describe the contents of a shipment and additional information about it, such as the items and packaging.

ASNs can help warehouse workers learn what is arriving when. Therefore, they can prepare. In addition, warehouse workers can use ASNs to match the details of a shipment to the related purchase order that was previously created.

This article presents a collection of scenarios that show, through examples, how to work with ASN files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Inbound ASN* import applies only to items that are enabled for warehouse management processes (WMS). Before you receive an ASN, a purchase order must be registered in the system against the vendor who is sending that ASN.

## Inbound ASN V3 entity

You import inbound ASNs by using the *Inbound ASN V3* composite data entity. *Inbound ASN V3* takes advantage of the following entities:

- Inbound load header
- Inbound shipment header
- Inbound load packing structures
- Inbound load packing structure cases
- Inbound load packing structure case lines
- Inbound load packing structure lines

The *Inbound ASN V3* composite data entity is intended for asynchronous integration scenarios where XML fileâ€“based imports are used.

## XML format for importing ASNs

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports the following XML format for importing ASNs. Each node in the XML file represents an attribute from an individual entity.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Document>
    <WHSInboundLoadHeaderEntity>
        <WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity>
            <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity>
                <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureCaseEntity>
                    <WHSInboundPackingStructureCaseLineV3Entity>
                    </WHSInboundPackingStructureCaseLineV3Entity>
                </WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureCaseEntity>
                <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureLineV3Entity>
                </WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureLineV3Entity>
            </WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity>
        </WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity>
    </WHSInboundLoadHeaderEntity>
</Document>
```

## Examples

The following subsections provide examples of ASN XML import files for vendor shipments.

### Example 1

The following example shows an XML file for importing vendor shipments for one purchase order when no case details are included.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Document>
    <WHSInboundLoadHeaderEntity TRACTORNUMBER="0000101">
        <WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity VENDORSHIPMENTID="VendASN_01" VENDORADDRESSCOUNTRYREGIONID = "USA" VENDORADDRESSSTREET = "123 Coffee Street" VENDORADDRESSSTATEID = "WA" VENDORADDRESSCITY = "Redmond" VENDORADDRESSZIPCODE = "98052">
            <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity LICENSEPLATENUMBER="LP_ASN_001">
                <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureLineV3Entity PURCHASEORDERNUMBER="00000176" ITEMNUMBER="A0001" QUANTITY="1" UNITSYMBOL="ea" />
            </WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity>
        </WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity>
    </WHSInboundLoadHeaderEntity>
</Document>
```

### Example 2

The following example shows an XML file for importing vendor shipments for one purchase order when case details are included.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Document>
    <WHSInboundLoadHeaderEntity ESTIMATEDARRIVALDATETIME="2021-04-25T11:00:00+00:00">
        <WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity VENDORSHIPMENTID="MVR_SNN_0004">
            <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity LICENSEPLATENUMBER="MVR_SNN_0004" PACKEDTOTALQUANTITY="2.00">
                <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureCaseEntity PARENTPACKINGSTRUCTURELICENSEPLATENUMBER="MVR_SNN_0004" LICENSEPLATENUMBER="MVR_SNN_0004A" PACKEDTOTALQUANTITY="2.00" />
                <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureLine3Entity PURCHASEORDERNUMBER="00000175" ITEMNUMBER="A0001" PURCHASEORDERLINENUMBER="1" QUANTITY="2.00" UNITSYMBOL="ea" />
            </WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity>
        </WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity>
    </WHSInboundLoadHeaderEntity>
</Document>
```

### Example 3

The following example shows an XML file for importing vendor shipments for multiple purchase orders when case details are included.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Document>
    <WHSInboundLoadHeaderEntity TRACTORNUMBER="0000101">
        <WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity VENDORSHIPMENTID="VendASN_01" VENDORADDRESSCOUNTRYREGIONID = "USA" VendorAddressStreet = "123 Coffee Street" VENDORADDRESSSTATEID = "WA" VENDORADDRESSCITY = "Redmond" VENDORADDRESSZIPCODE = "98052">
            <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity LICENSEPLATENUMBER="LP_ASN_001">
                <WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureLineV3Entity PURCHASEORDERNUMBER="00000176" ITEMNUMBER="A0001" QUANTITY="100" UNITSYMBOL="ea" />
            </WHSInboundLoadPackingStructureEntity>
        </WHSInboundShipmentHeaderEntity>

## Inspect the results of importing an ASN file

Follow these steps to inspect the results of importing an ASN file.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Loads \> All loads**.
1. Find and open a load that was created as part of an ASN import.
1. On the **Load** FastTab, you should see values that are based on the XML file.
1. On the **Load lines** FastTab, you should see purchase order numbers and item details that are based on the XML file.
1. On the Action Pane, on the **Ship and receive** tab, in the **Receive** group, select **Packing structure** to review the packing structure of the load.
1. On the **Pallets** FastTab, you should see license plates that are based on the XML file.
1. On the **Cases** FastTab, you should see cases that are based on the XML file.
1. On the **Items** FastTab, you should see items and quantities that are based on the XML file.
