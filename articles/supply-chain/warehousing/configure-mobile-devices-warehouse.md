# Set up mobile devices for warehouse work

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article describes how to configure the menu items that warehouse workers use to perform work on a mobile device.

**Note:** This article applies to features in Warehouse management. It doesn't apply to features in Inventory management. The menu items that appear on the menus on a warehouse mobile device are configured on the **Mobile device menu items** page. Because the menu items can be put onto different menus, it's easy to configure menu structures so that only specific types of work are exposed to specific users. You can configure menu items to perform the following tasks:

-   Process an inquiry or perform an activity, such as printing a label, generating license plate numbers, starting a production order, or quickly looking up information about items in a location.
-   Create work that will be performed through another process. For example, receiving an item for a purchase order can create put-away work for another worker.
-   Perform work that was created by another process (existing work), such as put-away work that was created when an item was received for a purchase order.

To create a menu item for an activity or inquiry, set the **Mode** field to **Indirect**. A list of **Activity code** options then becomes available, so that you can select the type of inquiry or activity that the menu item is for. To create a menu item to generate warehouse work, set the **Mode** field to **Work**. A list of **Work creation process** options then becomes available. To create a menu item to process existing warehouse work, set the **Mode** field to **Work**, and then set the **Use existing work** option to **Yes**. **Note:** Additional fields might be available for menu items, depending on the mode that you select for the menu item, and whether the menu item is used to perform existing work. For information about the additional field selections, see the “Additional menu item options” section later in this article.

## Configure menu items for activities and inquiries
If the **Mode** field for a menu item is set to **Indirect**, you can create a menu item to perform a general activity or inquiry that doesn't create work. Examples include reprinting license plate labels and an inquiry about the items in a location. The following table lists the options that are available.

| License plate build         | Create a parent license plate by combining multiple license plates in the same location. This option is useful if you move multiple license plates at the same time. After the parent license plate is moved, you must perform a license plate break before you can pick items from each license plate. **Tip:** To move a parent license plate, you must use a mobile device that is configured to create work for movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Configure menu items to create work for another worker or process
You can set up a menu item that creates work for another worker after an initial action is performed on the mobile device. For example, when one worker uses a mobile device to receive an item, put-away work is created for another worker. To set up a menu item that creates work, on the **Mobile device menu items** page, in the **Mode** field, select **Work**. In the following table, the options in the **Work creation process** field are arranged by work order type.

## Configure menu items to process existing work
In addition to setting up menu items to create warehouse work, you can set up menu items to process work that has already been created. Set the **Mode** field to **Work**, and select the **Use existing work** option. Some additional options then become available on the **General** tab. You can control access to the menu item by assigning one or more work classes on the **Work class** FastTab. The work classes define the work that the menu item can process. The work class can also be used to grant access to specific user roles or to separate processing for different types of operations. The following table describes the options that are available.

<table>




<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>None</td>
<td>This default value doesn't process work.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>System directed</td>
<td>Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations controls the type of work that is assigned to a worker and the order that the worker performs the work in. When you select this option, you can click <strong>System-directed work</strong> on the Action pane to open the <strong>System-directed sorting order</strong> page, where you can set up sorting criteria for the work. The sorting criteria control the order that the worker performs the work in. You can add as many criteria as you require.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>User directed</td>
<td>The worker selects the work to perform and the order to perform it in.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>User grouping</td>
<td>The worker manually groups work. This option is useful when, for example, a worker can pick multiple items at the same time in a location. After the worker has finished picking all the required items, he or she can put the items away.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>System grouping</td>
<td>Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations groups work for the worker, based on a specified field. For example, picking work is grouped when a worker scans a shipment ID, load ID, or any value that can link each work unit. If you select this option, the following fields are required:
<ul>
<li><strong>System grouping field</strong> – Select the field that the worker scans to group the work.</li>
<li><strong>System grouping label</strong> – Enter text to instruct the worker what to scan to group the work.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Validated user directed</td>
<td>The worker selects the work to perform when work is associated with a larger entity, such as a load or shipment. The worker determines the order that the items are picked in. If you select this option, the following fields are required:
<ul>
<li><strong>Validated user directed field</strong> – Select the field that the worker scans to group the work.</li>
<li><strong>Validated user directed label</strong> – Enter text that instructs the worker what to scan when picking work is grouped by the system.</li>
</ul>
This option is useful when, for example, multiple pallets are staged for a load. If you select <strong>LoadId</strong> in the <strong>Validated User Directed</strong> field, the worker can pick any pallet that is associated with the load. The worker receives an error message if he or she scans an item that isn't associated with the load.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cluster picking</td>
<td>The worker groups work into clusters. Clusters lets workers pick items from a single location for multiple work orders at the same time.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Cycle count grouping</td>
<td>The worker selects a zone, work pool, or location, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations assigns work, based on the selection. If you select this option, you can click <strong>Cycle counting</strong> on the Action pane to specify additional information to display, and you can also specify the number of times that the worker must repeat the count if a difference is found.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

## Additional menu item options
Additional menu items options are available on the **Mobile device menu items** page. The options vary, depending on the process that you’re configuring the menu item for. 

The following table describes these options.

<table>




<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Allow splitting of work</td>
<td>Select this option to let users put items for a work order into more than one target license plate. This option is useful when, for example, a target license plate is full, and the worker must add the remaining items to another license plate. The worker can click <strong>Full</strong> to indicate that the license plate is full and stop receiving picking work for it. The put location for the picked items is then displayed, and the picking work that has already been completed is moved to a new work order. The remaining picking work for the target license plate stays on the original work order.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Anchoring</td>
<td>Select this option to let workers specify a location that overrides the suggested staging or loading location. All the remaining put-away work is directed to the new location. This option is useful when, for example, a worker who must put items for order 1 in a staging location by Dock 1 can’t, because a previous load hasn’t cleared the location. Instead of waiting for the Dock 1 staging location to become available, the worker can decide to use the staging location for Dock 2. In this case, the worker overrides the suggested staging location. The put location for all remaining items for the work order is then updated to the Dock 2 staging location. If you select this option, you must set the <strong>Anchor by</strong> field.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Anchor by</td>
<td>If you're using anchoring, you must specify whether to anchor by shipment or by load.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Audit template ID</td>
<td>Select the work audit template that will interrupt the work process for this menu item so that another operation can be performed. For example, if this menu item is for inbound work, the audit template might require that the worker check the temperature in the delivery container.

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cluster profile ID</td>
<td>Select the cluster profile to use for cluster picking. The cluster profile includes settings such as whether to create clusters automatically, the names of positions and the number of work units that they can be assigned, when to break clusters into individual units, and whether verification is required. This field is available only if <strong>Cluster picking</strong> is selected in the <strong>Directed by</strong> field.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Count total item quantity first</td>
<td>Select this option to require that a worker count the total quantity first during a count. If a difference is found, the worker must provide additional information, such as the license plate number, batch number, and serial numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Create movement</td>
<td>Select this option to let a worker create work for a movement, but without requiring that the worker perform the work immediately. This option is useful if, for example, a quality inspection has been completed, and the inspector wants the item to be moved from the quality inspection area.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Directive code</td>
<td>To use a specific location directive, select the directive code that is associated the location directive. This field is available when you create work and the work creation process is <strong>Movement by template</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Disable cycle count thresholds</td>
<td>Select this option to ignore the cycle count thresholds. If you select this option, cycle count work isn't created when threshold values are exceeded.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Display batch disposition code</td>
<td>Select this option to display batch disposition codes. For example, you can display batch disposition codes when you receive a returned batch. Workers can then evaluate the status or quality of a batch, and select the appropriate code. The rules on the batch disposition code determine whether the batch will be available to other warehouse processes. If you don't select this option, one of the following batch disposition codes is used:
<ul>
<li>If you receive a new batch number, the default batch disposition code that is specified on the item model group</li>
<li>The batch disposition code that is already assigned to the batch</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Display disposition code</td>
<td>Select this option to display disposition codes. For example, you can display disposition codes when you receive return items. Workers can then evaluate the status or quality of the items, and select the appropriate code. The rules on the disposition code determine whether the items will be available to other warehouse processes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Display inventory status</td>
<td>Select this option to display the status of items in inventory. This option is available for all menu items that use existing work, except cycle counting.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Display summary of pick screen</td>
<td>Select this option to display a summary of picking work for the selected work order. The summary is displayed until the first work line is processed for the work order.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Generate license plate</td>
<td>Select this option to generate a unique license plate number, based on the number sequence selection. For example, you can generate a license plate number for items that are received for purchase orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Group put away</td>
<td>Select this option to group the put-away work. This option is available when the work was grouped either by the worker or by Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. When the worker has finished all the picking work in the group, put-away work is created for the same group.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Inventory adjustment types</td>
<td>Select the inventory adjustment type that determines the inventory counting journal that is used to post the adjustment, and whether to remove reservations. This field is available only for the <strong>Adjustment in</strong> or <strong>Adjustment out</strong> work creation process.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Override batch number</td>
<td>Select this option to let workers who are reporting a quantity as finished for a production order enter a batch number that differs from the batch number that is assigned to the production order.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Override target license plate</td>
<td>Select this option to let workers specify a target license plate number that differs from the suggested target license plate. Use this option when the first pick for a work order is for the entire quantity of an item on a license plate. This option is useful when, for example, a pallet is reused.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Pick and pack</td>
<td>Select this option to let workers combine work for a sales order or load into a single work unit. A worker can perform work only for the sales order or load. This option is useful when, for example, you must increase a quantity for a sales order after the load, shipment, and work have been created for the sales order. This option is available when the menu item uses existing work, and the work is directed by the user or system.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>None</td>
<td>Indicate whether the worker must pick the oldest batch in a location first. The following options are available:
<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong> – The worker can pick any batch in the location. The worker receives no message.</li>

## Require workers to confirm the product, location, or quantity when they pick items
You can set up work confirmations that require that a worker use a mobile device to register the location or quantity when he or she performs work in the warehouse. Work confirmations help guarantee that the worker is at the correct location or is handling the correct quantity of items. You can also enable Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations to automatically confirm the worker’s registration. If you enable automatic confirmation, you can't also require confirmations for location or quantity. Work confirmations also include products and product variants. Additionally, you can register confirmations by scanning a bar code. To confirm products and product variants, you must enter an ID for the product or product variant. This ID can be a product ID, product search ID, external ID, GTIN, or bar code. After you enter the ID or scan the bar code, the dimensions for the product variant are displayed on the mobile device. 

The following table describes the various work types that you can use work confirmations with.

| Option                 | Description                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick                   | Require confirmation when items are picked.                                |
