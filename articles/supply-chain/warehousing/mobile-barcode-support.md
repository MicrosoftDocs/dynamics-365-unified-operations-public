# Mobile bar code support

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Because Android is an open-source project, any manufacturer of hardware for warehouse bar code scanners can build a device to run the Android operating system. A device is only Android-compatible if it can run apps that are written for the Android execution environment.

However, a hardware vendor can modify and create overlays for the Android version that runs on their hardware. Microsoft can't take any responsibility to ensure that a mobile bar code scanning app for Android is compatible with a manufacturer's bar code scanning hardware and the Android version that runs on it.

The Warehouse Management mobile app has been tested with a selection of Android powered devices for bar code scanning. These tests only cover a sample of the devices that are available on the market.

As a customer, we recommend that you test the Warehouse mobile scanning app on selected hardware before you decide on the hardware that you want to buy.
