# Consolidate shipments by using the shipment consolidation workbench

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic presents a scenario where multiple orders are released to the warehouse and then consolidated into shipments later by using the shipment consolidation workbench.

## Make demo data available

The scenario in this topic references values and records that are included in the standard demo data that is provided for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. If you want to use the values that are provided here as you do the exercises, be sure to work in an environment where the demo data is installed, and set the legal entity to **USMF** before you begin.

## Set up shipment consolidation policies and product filters

The scenario that is described here assumes that you've already turned on the feature, done the exercises in [Configure shipment consolidation policies](configure-shipment-consolidation-policies.md), and created the policies and other records that are described there. Be sure to do those exercises before you continue with this scenario.

## Turn on the manual shipment consolidation feature

Before you can use the *Manual shipment consolidation* feature, you must turn it on in your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Warehouse management*
- **Feature name:** *Manual shipment consolidation*

As was mentioned in [Configure shipment consolidation policies](configure-shipment-consolidation-policies.md), you must also turn on the *Consolidate shipment* feature before you can create policies. However, you should already have completed that step.

## Create the sales orders for this scenario

Start by creating a collection of sales orders that you can work with. You must work with a warehouse that is enabled for advanced warehouse (WMS) processes. Unless a different warehouse is explicitly mentioned, that same warehouse must be used for each of the following sets of orders.

Go to **Accounts receivable \> Orders \> All sales orders**, and create a collection of sales orders that have the settings that are described in the following subsections.

### Create order set 1

#### Sales orders 1-1 and 1-2

1. Create two identical sales orders that have the following settings:

    - **Customer account:** *US-001*
    - **Mode of delivery:** *Airwa-Air*

1. Add an order line that has the following settings:

    - **Item number:** *A0001* (an item that no **Code 4** filter is assigned to)
    - **Quantity:** *1.00*

1. Select **Inventory \> Reservation**, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Reserve lot** to reserve the order line.

## Verify the shipments

The following procedure lets you verify the shipments that have been created or updated as a result of shipment consolidation. Use it to review each order set that you created for this scenario, and then review the subsections that follow to make sure that you've obtained the expected results.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Shipments \> All shipments**.
1. Find and select the required shipment.
1. If a consolidation policy was used when the shipment was created or updated, you should see it in the **Shipment consolidation policy** field.

### Related shipments for order set 1

Two shipments should have been created:

- The first shipment contains three lines and was created by using the *CustomerMode* shipment consolidation policy.
- The second shipment, which doesn't use the *Airways* transportation mode of delivery, was created by using the *CustomerOrderNo* shipment consolidation policy.

### Related shipments for order set 2

Three shipments should have been created:

- The first shipment contains *Flammable* items.
- Each of the other two shipments contains one line that has the *Explosive* item.

### Related shipments for order set 3

Two shipments should have been created:

- The first shipment contains order lines from the sales order where the **Customer requisition** field is set to *1*.
- The second shipment contains order lines from sales order where the **Customer requisition** field is set to *2*.

### Related shipments for order set 4

Four shipments should have been created:

- Lines from two orders for customer *US-003* were grouped into one shipment by using the *Order pool* shipment consolidation policy.
- Lines from two orders for customer *US-004* were grouped into one shipment by using the *Order pool* shipment consolidation policy.
- Lines from sales orders 4-5 and 4-6 for customer *US-007* were grouped into one shipment by using the *Order pool* shipment consolidation policy.
