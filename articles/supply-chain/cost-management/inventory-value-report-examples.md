# Inventory value report examples and logic

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Inventory value reports provide details about your inventory physical and financial quantities and amounts. This topic provides some examples of results that are presented on each type of inventory value report.

For more information about how to generate and use each type of inventory value report, see [Inventory value reports](inventory-value-report-storage.md).

## Sample data that is used in these examples

The examples in this topic are based on the sample inventory transaction data that is described in this section.

### Storage dimension setup

The example system contains the following setup of storage dimensions.

| Name | Active | Physical inventory | Financial inventory |
|---|---|---|---|
| Site | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Warehouse | Yes | Yes | No |

### Inventory model

For the example system, the inventory model for the released products is *FIFO*, and the **Cost price** field for the inventory model is set to *Include physical value*.

### Inventory transactions

The example system contains the following inventory transactions for a released product that has the item number *B0001*.

| Reference | Site | Warehouse | Receipt | Issue | Physical date | Financial date | Quantity | Cost amount | Physical cost amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase order | 1 | 11 | Purchased | | March 15 | March 15 | 10 | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| Purchase order | 2 | 21 | Purchased | | March 15 | March 15 | 10 | 2,000 | 2,000 |
| Purchase order | 1 | 11 | Received | | April 15 | | 5 | | 375 |
| Transfer order | 1 | 11 | | Sold | May 2 | May 2 | -5 | -458.33 | -458.33 |
| Transfer order | 1 | 12 | Purchased | | May 2 | May 2 | 5 | 458.33 | 458.33 |
| Sales order | 1 | 12 | | Sold | May 3 | May 3 | -1 | -91.67 | -91.67 |

### Inventory value report configuration

The example system includes an inventory value report configuration that has the following settings:

- **Range:**  *Posting date*
- **Inventory:** *Yes*
- **Calculate average unit cost:** *Yes*
- **Total quantity and value:** *Yes*
- **Site, View:** *Selected*
- **Resource ID, View:** *Yes*
- **Level:** *Totals*

## Inventory value report example 1

The following table and illustrations show the results when you use the sample data and report configuration that are described earlier in this topic.

| Resource type | Resource | Site | Reference | Inventory: Financial quantity | Inventory: Financial amount | Inventory: Physical quantity posted | Inventory: Physical amount posted | Inventory: Quantity | Inventory: Amount | Average unit cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Material | B0001 | 1 | Ending balance | 9.00 | 908.33 | 5.00 | 375.00 | 14.00 | 1,283.33 | 91.67 |

## Inventory value report example 3

We recommend that you run inventory value reports after recalculation or inventory closing, so that you have the transactions and amounts that are affected by the recalculation or inventory closing.

The following subsections show the inventory value reports that are generated after you close inventory until May 30.
