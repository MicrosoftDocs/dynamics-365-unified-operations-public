# Get started with the cost accounting service (private preview)

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The functionality that is described in this topic is available as part of a private preview release. The content of this topic and the functionality that it describes are subject to change. For more information about preview releases, see [One version service updates FAQ](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/one-version.md).

The cost accounting service lets you do multiple inventory accounting in the cost accounting ledgers that you've set up. You associate each cost accounting ledger with a *convention*. A convention is a collection of the following types of accounting policies:

- Cost object
- Input measurement basis
- Cost flow assumption
- Cost element

> [!NOTE]
> Even after you've turned on the cost accounting service, you can still do  inventory accounting in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, as usual.

The cost accounting service is an add-in. To makes its features available, you must install it from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). Therefore, you can choose to evaluate it in a test environment before you turn it on for production environments.

The cost accounting service doesn't currently support all the cost management features that are built into Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. Therefore, it's important that you evaluate whether the set of features that is currently available will meet your requirements.
