International organizations are under increasing pressure to comply with both local regulations (local generally accepted accounting principles \[GAAP\]) and shared accounting standards (such as US-GAAP, International Financial Reporting Standards \[IFRS\], and International Accounting Standards \[IAS\]), even in situations where the different standards and regulations might be in conflict.

International organizations that have subsidiaries in countries or regions where there is a hyper-fluctuating local currency might be required by the local government to account and manage inventory in that currency. However, to comply with US-GAAP, the subsidiary is also required to account and manage inventory in a stable currency, such as US dollars (USD).

Organizations might prefer to account inventory by standard cost as part of their management accounting setup. However, IFRS, local governments, and local tax authorities don't always recognize standard cost as an accepted method. Instead, they often require average, first in, first out (FIFO), or specific identification.

The cost accounting service add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management lets you account inventory in multiple ledgers. Therefore, it supports multiple currencies and multiple valuations.
