# View cost object balance

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Follow these steps to view your cost object balance. This procedure is intended for the cost controller.

1. Go to **Cost management** \> **Workspaces** \> **Cost administration**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Released products**.
1. Find and select the product you're looking for. If necessary, you can use the **Filter** field to help find it.
1. On the Action Pane, open the **Manage costs** tab and select **Cost objects**.
1. Find and select the cost object you're looking for.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Physical quantity**.
1. If you'd like to change the set of dimensions displayed, select **Dimensions display** from the Action Pane and then use the dialog to choose which dimensions to show. The **Physical quantity** grid shows a row for each unique combination of displayed dimensions, so if you show fewer dimensions, you'll probably see fewer rows, but the total quantity for all rows remains the same.
