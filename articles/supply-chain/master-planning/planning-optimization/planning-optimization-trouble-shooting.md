# Troubleshoot Planning Optimization 

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to fix common issues that you might encounter while working with Planning Optimization.

## Installation of the Planning Optimization add-in doesn't complete

Planning Optimization requires a Lifecycle Services (LCS) enabled, high-availability environment, tier 2 or higher (not a OneBox environment), with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.7 or later. If you try to install the add-in on a OneBox environment, the installation won't complete.

**Fix**: Cancel the installation and use a high-availability environment, tier 2 or higher (not a OneBox environment).

## Planning of batch jobs fails when Planning Optimization is enabled

When you enable Planning Optimization, the built-in master planning engine is automatically disabled. Master planning batch jobs that were created for the built-in Supply Chain Management planning engine will fail if they are triggered while Planning Optimization is enabled. You may receive an error message such as *This operation triggered master planning that isn't supported when Planning Optimization is enabled*.

**Fix**: Cancel all master planning batch jobs that were created for the built-in Supply Chain Management planning engine.

## Planning Optimization results are different from earlier results

Planning Optimization differs from the built-in master planning design in some areas. This can also be caused by pending features.

**Fix**: Run Planning Optimization fit analysis and then analyze the results while referring to the related documentation to understand the impact. For more information, see [Planning Optimization fit analysis](planning-optimization-fit-analysis.md).

## Master planning doesn't respect the coverage time fence

This is caused by a pending feature for Planning Optimization.

**Fix**: Until the pending feature is available, filter or delete planned orders to remove supply suggestions outside of the coverage time fence.

## Can't enable Planning Optimization

The **Connection status** must be **Connected** before you can set **Use Planning Optimization** to **Yes**. For more information, see [Get started with Planning Optimization](get-started.md).

**Fix**: Make sure that the Planning Optimization add-in was installed successfully.

## Error message is shown during CTP

If you try to run capable to promise (CTP) from a sales order when Planning Optimization is enabled, you will receive the following error message: *This operation triggered master planning that isn't supported when the Planning Optimization is enabled*.

This is related to a pending feature that is planned as part of the support for production orders.

**Fix:** Avoid CTP calculations when Planning Optimization is enabled until CTP support is available.
