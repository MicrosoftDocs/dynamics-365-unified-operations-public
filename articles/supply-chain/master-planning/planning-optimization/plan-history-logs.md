This topic explains how to view the history of planning jobs that are triggered by the Planning Optimization functionality in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

To view the history for a plan, open the plan by going to **Master planning** \> **Setup** \> **Plans** \> **Master plans** and selecting **History**. The history lists all the jobs for the selected plan. The list includes completed and active jobs.

In addition to seeing the start time and status of jobs, you can view the log for a specific job. The log includes additional information and warnings. Not all jobs have a log. To view the log for a job, select **Log**.
