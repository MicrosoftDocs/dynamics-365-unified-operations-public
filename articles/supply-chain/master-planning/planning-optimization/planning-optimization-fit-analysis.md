# Planning Optimization fit analysis

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Planning Optimization fit analysis helps you identify where the result might differ between the deprecated master planning engine and Planning Optimization. The system runs this analysis based on your current setup and data.

You should analyze the result from the Planning Optimization fit analysis as part of the migration process. Note that the scope of Planning Optimization isn't equal to the deprecated master planning engine functionality. We recommend that you work with your partner and read the documentation to prepare for the migration.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Some inconsistencies can't be identified by the Planning Optimization fit analysis. For more information, see [Differences between classic master planning and Planning Optimization](planning-optimization-differences-with-built-in.md).
> - If inconsistencies are found, you can still use Planning Optimization. The results of the fit analysis just show places where the planning service won't honor your current setup. In other words, they show places where some processes might be ignored or might not be supported.

## Run Planning Optimization fit analysis

To run the Planning Optimization fit analysis and view the results, follow these steps.

1. Select a company (legal entity) from the company picker in the navigation bar.
1. Go to **Master planning** \> **Setup** \> **Planning Optimization fit analysis**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Run analysis**.
1. The system runs the analysis and then shows the results. For each result that's shown, consult the table later in this article to see whether that feature is currently supported for Planning Optimization and, if it isn't yet supported, when support is expected to become available. If no issues exist for your selected company, the result list will be blank, and you'll receive a "No issues found" message.
1. Repeat this procedure for each company in your organization.

## Possible results from the fit analysis

The following table shows the various results that can be shown after a fit analysis. Number signs (*\#*) will be replaced with a number that indicates the number of records that have the listed issue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For features that are not yet supported, the following table provides expected availability information that is estimated based on our current roadmap. These estimates are subject to change without notice.

| Feature | Listed issue | Explanation | Expected availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Actions | Coverage groups with Actions calculation enabled: *\#* | This feature is now supported. | Supported |
| Base calendars | Calendars using base calendar: *\#* | This feature is now supported. | Supported |
| Batch disposition codes | Non-nettable batch disposition masters: *\#* | This feature is now supported. For additional information, see [Use batch disposition codes to mark batches as available or unavailable](../../inventory/batch-disposition-codes.md) | Supported |
| Capable to promise (CTP) | Default order settings with delivery date control set to CTP: *\#* | In Supply Chain Management 10.0.28 and newer, a process called *CTP for Planning Optimization* makes confirmed ship and receipt dates available after the dynamic plan has been run. For older versions of Supply Chain Management, the legacy CTP setting is ignored when Planning Optimization is enabled. | Supported |
| Firming | Coverage groups with auto firming time fence set: *\#* | In version 10.0.7 and later, firming is supported as a separate firming batch job after master planning is completed (provided the *Auto-firming for Planning Optimization* feature has been enabled in [feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)). Note that auto firming for Planning Optimization is based on the order date (start date), not the requirement date (end date). This behavior ensures that firming of planned orders occurs in due time, without having to include lead time in the firming time fence. | Supported |
| Firming | Item coverage records with auto firming set: *\#* | In version 10.0.7 and later, auto firming is supported as a separate firming batch job after master planning is completed (provided the *Auto-firming for Planning Optimization* feature has been enabled in [feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)). Note that auto firming for Planning Optimization is based on the order date (start date), not the requirement date (end date). This behavior ensures that firming of planned orders occurs in due time, without having to include lead time in the firming time fence. | Supported |
| Firming | Master plans with auto firming set: *\#* | In version 10.0.7 and later, auto firming is supported as a separate firming batch job after master planning is completed (provided the *Auto-firming for Planning Optimization* feature has been enabled in [feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)). Note that auto firming for Planning Optimization is based on the order date (start date), not the requirement date (end date). This behavior ensures that firming of planned orders occurs in due time, without having to include lead time in the firming time fence. | Supported |
