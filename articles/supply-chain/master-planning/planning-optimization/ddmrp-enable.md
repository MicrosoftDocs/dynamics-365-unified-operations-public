Before you can use Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP) functionality, it and its prerequisite feature must be turned on for your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of these features and turn them on. Turn on the following features in the following order:

1. **Feature name:** *Priority driven MRP support for Planning Optimization*
1. **Feature name:** *(Preview) DDMRP for Planning Optimization*

For more information, see [Priority-based planning](priority-based-planning.md).
