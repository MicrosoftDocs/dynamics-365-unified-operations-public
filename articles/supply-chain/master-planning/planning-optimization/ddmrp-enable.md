# Turn on the DDMRP feature for your system

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

To use Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP) functionality, it must be enabled for your system. As of version 10.0.36, this feature is turned on by default. As of Supply Chain Management version 10.0.43, it's mandatory and can't be turned off. If you're running a version older than 10.0.43, then admins can turn this functionality on or off by searching for the *DDMRP for Planning Optimization* feature in the [Feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) workspace.

Learn more in [Priority-based planning](priority-based-planning.md).
