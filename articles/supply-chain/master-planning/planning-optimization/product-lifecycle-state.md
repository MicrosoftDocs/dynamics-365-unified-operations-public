# Exclude products that have specific product lifecycle states

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Released products and released product versions include a **Product lifecycle state** field. This field lets you control, among other things, which products are included during master planning. You can add, remove, and edit lifecycle states as required by going to **Product information management \> Setup \> Product lifecycle state**. For each product lifecycle state, set the **Is active for planning** option to *Yes* if products that have that state should be included during master planning. When the option is set to *No*, the associated products and variants will be excluded from all master planning and all calculations at the bill of materials (BOM) level.

Released products and variants where the **Product lifecycle state** field is left blank are treated as though they have a product lifecycle state where the **Is active for planning** option is set to *Yes*. In other words, they will be included during master planning.

> [!NOTE]
> To help avoid unnecessary supply suggestions, we strongly recommend that you associate all obsolete released products and variants with a product lifecycle state where the **Is active for planning** option is set to *No*. This approach is especially important when you work with product configuration variants that aren't reusable, because it will help prevent waste.
