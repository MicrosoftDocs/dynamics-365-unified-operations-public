# Differences between built-in master planning and Planning Optimization

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Planning Optimization results might differ from results from the built-in master planning engine. The differences can be caused by pending features. This topic lists features that Planning Optimization doesn't yet support and that aren't listed on the **[Planning Optimization fit analysis](planning-optimization-fit-analysis.md)** page].

| Feature | Current behavior in Planning Optimization |
|---|---|
| Catch weight products | Catch-weight products are considered usual products.|
| Extensible dimensions | Extensible dimensions are empty on planned orders, even when the **Coverage plan by dimension** checkbox is selected on the **Storage dimension groups** or **Tracking dimension groups** page. |
| Filtered production runs | For details, see [Production planning - Filters](production-planning.md#filters). |
| Forecast planning | Forecast planning isn't supported. We recommend that you use master planning where a forecast model is assigned to the master plan. |
| Number sequences for planned orders | Number sequences for planned orders aren't supported. Planned order numbers are generated on the service side. The planned order number is normally shown with 10 digits, but the sequence is actually built on 20 characters, with 10 digits allocated for the planning run count and the other 10 digits for the planned orders count. |
| Plan copy, delete plan, and plan version cleanup | <p>The following items are disabled under **Master planning \> Master planning \> Maintain plans** in the navigation pane:</p><ul><li>Plan copy</li><li>Delete plan</li><li>Plan version cleanup</li></ul> |
| Return orders | Return orders aren't considered. |
| Scheduling related features | For details, see [Scheduling with infinite capacity](infinite-capacity-planning.md#limitations). |
| Safety stock fulfillment | Planning Optimization always uses the *Today's date + procurement time* option for the **Fulfill minimum** field on the **Item coverage** page. This helps to prevent unwanted planned orders and other issues because if the procurement time isn't included for safety stock, planned orders that are created for low on-hand inventory would always be delayed because of the lead time. |
| Safety stock pegging and net requirements | The *Safety stock* requirement type isn't included and isn't displayed on the **Net requirements** page. Safety stock doesn't represent demand and doesn't have a requirement date associated with it. Instead, it sets a constraint on how much inventory must be present at all times. However, the **Minimum** field value is still taken into account when calculating planned orders during master planning. We suggest that you inspect the **Accumulated quantity** column on the **Net requirements** page to see that this value was considered. |
| Transport calendars | The value in the **Transport calendar** column on the **Modes of delivery** page is ignored. |
