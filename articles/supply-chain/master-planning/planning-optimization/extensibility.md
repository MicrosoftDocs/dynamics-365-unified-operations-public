# Planning Optimization extensibility

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the extensibility scenarios that are related to master planning and supported in Planning Optimization. These capabilities are available starting in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.13.

## Custom processing when master planning is completed

In the most common extensibility scenario in Planning Optimization, custom processing is done after the plan has been updated. For example, you might add a column to the planned orders table (`ReqPO`), or you might want to derive some statistical information from the generated plan. The main extensibility point that enables these scenarios is the `jobCompletedSuccessfully` method in the `MpsMasterPlanningEvents` class.

```csharp
public static void jobCompletedSuccessfully(MpsMasterPlanningJobCompletedSuccessfullyEventArgs _args)
```

Here is an example of an extension that sets a custom `CstmOrderPriority` field on the planned order.

```csharp
[ExtensionOf(classStr(MpsMasterPlanningEvents))]
public static final class MpsMasterPlanningEvents_Cstm_Extension
{
    public static void jobCompletedSuccessfully(MpsMasterPlanningJobCompletedSuccessfullyEventArgs _args)
    {
        ttsbegin;

        var affectedPlannedOrdersQuery = _args.parmPostProcessingQueryBuilder().buildAffectedPlannedOrdersQuery();
        var affectedPlannedOrdersQueryRun = new QueryRun(affectedPlannedOrdersQuery);

        while (affectedPlannedOrdersQueryRun.next())
        {
            ReqPO reqPO = affectedPlannedOrdersQueryRun.get(tableNum(ReqPO));
            reqPO.selectForUpdate(true);
            reqPO.CstmOrderPriority = reqPO.ReqDate - systemDateGet() < 7 ? CstmPlannedOrderPriority::Urgent : CstmPlannedOrderPriority::Regular;
            reqPO.doUpdate();
        }

        ttscommit;

        next jobCompletedSuccessfully(_args);
    }

}
```

When you add custom logic, consider the following constraints and best practices:

- The `jobCompletedSuccessfully` method is called outside the transaction scope. Therefore, the plan is already visible to the user when the custom logic starts to run. If your customization sets additional fields on planned orders, it's important that you let users know that the values of those fields will eventually be consistent (in other words, they might be out of date immediately after a planning job is completed).
- Another master planning job can start when the `jobCompletedSuccessfully` method is called. The new job might affect the full plan or part of the plan. The new job might update or delete the same planned orders or requirement transactions that were created or updated as part of the planning job that was handled in `jobCompletedSuccessfully`. Update conflict exceptions must be handled when this event is extended.
- Avoid using single transaction scope when you extend this method. A single master planning run can produce millions of requirement transactions and hundreds of thousands of planned orders. If all these transactions and planned orders are processed in the scope of a single transaction, many SQL locks will occur and block other planning processes. Additionally, if the transaction is held for a long time, "ghost records" will be created in the SQL database. Ghost records will negatively affect every process in the system.
