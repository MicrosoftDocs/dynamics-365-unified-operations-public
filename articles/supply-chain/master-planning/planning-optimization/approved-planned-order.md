# Approve planned orders

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about how to update the status of planned orders in Planning Optimization.

Note that approval of planned orders is an optional step, on the way to create a firmed order from a planned order. It is recommended to approve modified planned orders, otherwise the edits will be ignored and overwritten by the next planning run.

The **Status** field helps you tack your progress using the following values:

- **Unprocessed:** When master planning generates planned orders, the planned orders have a status of *Unprocessed*. Planned orders with this status will be deleted during the next planning run.
- **Completed:** If you decide not to firm a planned order, you can change the status to *Completed* to indicate that you completed evaluating this planned order. Note that a status of *Unprocessed* and *Completed* are treated the same by the system.
- **Approved:** If you want to keep edits or are planning to firm a planned order, change the status to *Approved*. Planned orders with *Approved* status are considered as fixed and expected supply by master planning, so they are not modified or deleted during later master planning runs. To achieve this, the planning logic copies the *Approved* planned orders from the old plan version to the new plan version during master planning. Note that *Approved* planned orders are only considered supply within the specific master plan.

You can manage planned orders from the  **Master planning**  workspace, the  **Planned order**  list, or the  **Planned production orders**,  **Planned purchase orders**, and  **Planned transfer**  lists.
