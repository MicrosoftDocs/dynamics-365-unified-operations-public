# Parameters not used by Planning Optimization

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article lists the parameters that Planning Optimization doesn't currently consider during its operation. The planning service might skip a parameter because, for example, related functionality isn't yet supported. Alternatively, the parameter might have become obsolete because of functional changes.

The following sections list the parameters that Planning Optimization doesn't use on specific pages. They also explain why each parameter isn't used.
