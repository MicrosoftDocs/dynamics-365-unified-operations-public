# Planned orders simplified

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how you can view, manage, and firm planned orders by using the **Planned orders simplified** page.

The **Planned orders simplified** page is a simplified version of the **Planned orders** page. It provides fewer options but is faster to work with when all you have to do is review, approve, and firm your planned orders.

## Turn on this feature for your system

If your system doesn't already include the features that are described in this article, go to [Feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md), and turn on the *Planned orders simplified* feature.

## View, manage, and firm planned orders

The **Planned orders simplified** page is designed primarily for firming functionality. It shows all planned orders that have been generated for the selected plan, just as the standard **Planned orders** page does. Therefore, it can be used as an optimized alternative for viewing the results of a master planning run.

To open the **Planned orders simplified** page, go to **Master planning \> Master planning \> Planned orders simplified**. You can use this page to complete the following tasks:

- View all planned orders for a specific plan.
- Create new planned orders.
- Delete single or multiple planned orders.
- Firm single or multiple planned orders.
- Change the planned order status for single or multiple planned orders.
- Seamlessly open planned order details for an individual planned order to view full details of the order.
- Create custom views by using saved views.

Additional scenarios, such as split, are supported by the standard **Planned orders** page.
