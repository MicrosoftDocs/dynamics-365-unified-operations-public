# Planned orders simplified

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how you can view, manage, and firm planned orders by using the **Planned orders simplified** page.

The **Planned orders simplified** page is a simplified version of the **Planned orders** page. It provides fewer options but is faster to work with when all you have to do is review, approve, and firm your planned orders.

## Turn on this feature for your system

To use this feature, it must be turned on for your system. As of Supply Chain Management version 10.0.32, this feature is mandatory and can't be turned off. If you're running a version older than 10.0.32, then admins can turn this functionality on or off by searching for the *Planned orders simplified* feature in the [**Feature management** workspace](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## View, manage, and firm planned orders

The **Planned orders simplified** page is designed primarily for firming functionality. It shows all planned orders that have been generated for the selected plan, just as the standard **Planned orders** page does. Therefore, it can be used as an optimized alternative for viewing the results of a master planning run.

To open the **Planned orders simplified** page, go to **Master planning \> Master planning \> Planned orders simplified**. You can use this page to complete the following tasks:

- View all planned orders for a specific plan.
- Create new planned orders.
- Delete single or multiple planned orders.
- Firm single or multiple planned orders.
- Change the planned order status for single or multiple planned orders.
- Seamlessly open planned order details for an individual planned order to view full details of the order.
- Create custom views by using saved views.

Additional scenarios, such as split, are supported by the standard **Planned orders** page.
