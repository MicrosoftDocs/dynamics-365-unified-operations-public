# Inventory forecasts

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to view and create inventory forecasts. You can create and view supply and demand forecast lines for items, item groups, item allocation keys, customer accounts, customer groups, vendor accounts, and vendor groups.

For each forecast line, you can select the forecast model that is used. You can then specify the item or item group, plus the quantity or the transaction amount. You can also set up a time schedule for allocating the forecast quantity.

The supply and demand forecast lines produce an inventory forecast for the same combination of an item and a model. This inventory forecast represents a balance between the supply and demand that were entered for the same item. It can't be edited. The inventory forecast helps the inventory management team review expected changes to the on-hand inventory of an item during the upcoming period that has been forecasted.

After you enter your demand and/or supply, you can run forecast planning to calculate gross requirements for materials and capacity, and to generate planned orders.

## <a name="manual-entry"></a>View and manually enter forecast lines

Use this procedure to manually create forecast lines for products.

There are also other ways to create forecast lines:

- [Generate a statistical baseline forecast](generate-statistical-baseline-forecast.md).
- [Import historical data for demand forecasts](import-historical-data.md).
- [Generate the forecast by using a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning web service](demand-forecasting-setup.md).
- [Import demand or supply forecast lines by using the data management framework (ForecastDemandForecastEntryStaging and ForecastSupplyForecastEntryStaging data entities)](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages).

As the table in step 1 show, there are different ways to access the pages that are used.

1. Depending on the type of entity that you want to create a forecast for, and the type of forecast that you want to create, open a supply, demand, or inventory forecast page as described in the following table.

    | Entity | Instructions |
    |---|---|
    | Released products | <ol><li>Go to **Product information management \> Products \> Released products**.</li><li>Select the product to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, on the **Plan** tab, in the **Forecast** group, select **Demand forecast**, **Supply forecast**, or **Inventory forecast**, depending on the type of forecast that you want to work with.</li></ol> |

    Depending on your selection, the **Supply forecast** or **Demand forecast** page appears. It shows any existing forecast lines for the record that you selected before you opened the page.

1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a forecast line to the grid in the upper part of the page.
1. On the new line, in the **Model** field, select the forecast model to use. Then enter other details as required, such as the item, item group, customer or vendor account or group, item quantity, or total transaction amount. For complete details about the fields that are available on the **Supply forecast** and **Demand forecast** pages, see the later sections in this topic.
1. To distribute the forecast over the period, on the **Overview** tab, select **Allocate forecast** on the toolbar.
1. In the **Allocation** grid, review the time horizon and the time intervals that are used to distribute the forecast quantities.

## Supply forecast lines

The supply forecast lets you create a plan for items that must be purchased. It tells procurement and sourcing clerks what they are expected to order.

You can enter a supply forecast by item, item group, item allocation key, vendor, and vendor group. For information about all the ways to open the **Supply forecast** page for various entities and records, see the [View and manually enter forecast lines](#manual-entry) section earlier in this topic.

The upper part of the **Supply forecast** page provides a grid of supply forecast lines and a set of tabs that you can use to view and set more information about a selected forecast line. The lower part of the page provides an **Allocation** grid.

1. Depending on the type of entity that you're creating a forecast for, and the type of forecast that you want to create, open a supply or demand forecast page as described in [View and manually enter forecast lines](#manual-entry).
1. On the supply or demand forecast lines page, select a forecast line, and then, on the **Overview** tab, select **Allocate forecast** on the toolbar.
1. In the **Allocate forecast** dialog box, set the fields that are described in the following table. (The value that you select in the **Method** field determines that other fields that are available.)

    | Field | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Method | <p>Select the method that is used to allocate the forecast transaction:</p><ul><li>**None** – No allocation occurs.</li><li>**Period** – Forecast the same quantity for each period. If you select this value, specify a quantity in the **Per** field and a unit of time in the **Unit** field.</li><li>**Key** – Allocate the forecast according to the period allocation key that you specify in the **Period key** field. You can use this method when you want seasonal variations to be considered.</li><ul>|
    | Per | <p>Enter the number of time intervals into the future that the forecast extends. This field is available only if you select *Period* in the **Method** field.</p><p>For example, you select *Period* in the **Method** field, enter *1* in the **Per** field, and select *Months* in the **Unit** field. Then, in the **End** field, you specify an end date one year into the future. In this case, one forecast line will be created for each month of the upcoming year, based on the item and quantity that are specified on the header line. |
    | Unit | Select the unit of the time interval: *Days*, *Months*, or *Years*. Allocation then corresponds to the number of days, months, or years that you specify in the **Per** field.|
    | Period key | Specify the period allocation key that is used to allocate the forecast. For more information, see [Budget planning data allocation](../../finance/budgeting/budget-planning-data-allocation.md). |
    | End | Specify the end date that applies to your settings in the **Per** and **Unit** fields. |

1. Select **OK** to confirm your settings.
1. You can review the results on the **Allocation** tab for the same line.

## <a name="bulk-update"></a>Bulk update forecast transactions

Use this procedure to process existing forecast transaction lines. You can copy, edit, and delete forecast transaction lines.

1. On the supply or demand forecast lines page, select **Bulk update**.
1. In the dialog box, select **Filter**.
1. On the **Range** tab, select the criteria that identify the source forecast data that you want to copy, edit, or delete. This data might include the forecast model, item number, and customer account.
1. Select **OK** to confirm your selection.

    After the data is selected, you can use the **Edit forecast transactions** dialog box to define how you want to copy, edit, or delete it.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The filtering step is a prerequisite for using the **Bulk edit** functionality. If you skip it, the program selects and updates **all** forecast lines. Therefore, you might unintentionally cause duplication or removal of transactions.

1. In the **Management** section, select whether you want to copy, update, or delete the selected forecast transactions.
1. Use the **Modifications in field** section to change the parameters of the forecast. Select the checkbox for a parameter, and then select among the available options. For example, select the **Model** checkbox, and then select a forecast model number. Existing forecast lines are copied to the selected forecast model.
1. Use the **Change of period** section to move the start and end dates of the forecast forward or backward. Select the checkbox, and then use the quantity and period fields to define how the forecast dates should be moved. You can enter a negative quantity to move the start date forward (that is, make it earlier).

    For example, to delay the forecast transaction start date by six months, select the checkbox, enter *6* as the quantity, and select *Months* as the period.

1. Use the **Correct field** section to update the actual forecast data. In the **Field** field, select the criterion that you want to change. In the **Factor** field, enter a multiplication factor to apply to the selected criterion, or enter a constant to add or subtract. For example, select *Quantity* as the criterion, and enter a factor of *1.5* to multiply the item quantity by 1.5. Alternatively, enter a constant of *-25* to decrease the item quantity by 25 units.
1. Use the **Financial dimensions** section to update the financial dimensions of forecast lines. Select the financial dimensions that you want to change, and then enter a value to apply to the selected dimensions.
1. Select **OK** to apply your changes.

## Use forecasts with master planning

After you enter your demand forecast and/or supply forecast, you can include the forecasts during master planning to account for expected demand and/or supply in your master planning run. When forecasts are included in master planning, gross requirements for materials and capacity are calculated, and planned orders are generated.

### Set up a master plan to include an inventory forecast
