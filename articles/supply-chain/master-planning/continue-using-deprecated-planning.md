# Continue to use deprecated master planning for some companies

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Starting with Supply Chain Management version 10.0.32, it's possible allow some companies (legal entities) to run Planning Optimization while others continue to use the [deprecated master planning engine](deprecated-master-planning-overview.md) until they're ready to be migrated.

## Companies where planning processes are disabled

Starting with release 10.0.32, you must install the Planning optimization add-in before you can enable planning processes, even if you plan to use the deprecated master planning engine. If the company where you want to use deprecated master planning has planning processes disabled, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Make sure Planning Optimization is installed and enabled as described in [Get started with master planning](planning-optimization/get-started.md).
1. Make sure Planning Optimization is enabled on the **Planning Optimization parameters** page.
1. Enable planning processes for the relevant company by setting **Disable all planning processes** to *No*, on the **Master planning parameters** page.

## Excluding companies from using Planning Optimization and continue to use deprecated master planning

Follow these steps to set a company to use the deprecated master planning engine on an environment that is otherwise enabled to use Planning Optimization:

1. Use the company picker to choose the company (legal entity) that you want to set up.
1. Go to **Master planning \> Setup \> Planning Optimization parameters**.
1. Open the **Company information** tab.

1. Set **Exclude company from running Planning Optimization** to one of the following values
    - *Yes* – Use the deprecated master planning engine for this company.
    - *No* – Use Planning Optimization for this company.
1. Select **Save** on the Action Pane.
1. Repeat this procedure for each company you want to set up.
