# Remove outliers from historical transaction data when calculating a demand forecast

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article describes how to exclude outliers from the historical data that is used to calculate a demand forecast. By excluding outliers, you can improve forecast accuracy.

You can exclude outliers to improve forecast accuracy. This is an optional task. Here is an overview of the process:

1.  Click **Master planning** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Demand forecasting** &gt; **Outlier removal** to open the **Outlier removal** page, where you can use a query to select the transactions to exclude.
2.  Select the company that the query applies to, and then enter a name and description. The **Query date** field is automatically set to the current date.
3.  Select the **Active** check box to exclude the transactions that the query finds from the historical data. This setting will take effect when you create a baseline forecast.
4.  On the **Outlier removal query** page, you can add, remove, and select the criteria that define which transactions will be excluded when the baseline forecast is calculated. For example, select a specific item or order transaction to exclude.
5.  Click **Display transactions**. The **Outlier transactions** page lists the transactions that meet the criteria that you defined in the query, and that will be excluded from the historical data when the demand forecast is calculated.

**Note:** You can also create a query that is based on an existing query. Select the query to copy, and then click **Duplicate**. The **Query date** field identifies the version. You can use the query as it is, or you can click **Edit query** to modify the criteria. You can optionally modify the name and description of the new query.
