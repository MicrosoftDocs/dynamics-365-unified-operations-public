*Calculation models* let you arrange and configure tiles to define the calculation that's done by a calculation profile. Each model presents a flowchart that graphically represents the calculation that the model does.

## Create and customize a calculation model

To create and customize a calculation model, you must first open an existing calculation profile. (For more information, see [Work with calculation profiles](calculation-profiles.md).) You can then fully customize the model that the selected profile uses by adding, removing, and arranging tiles, and configuring settings for each of them.

Follow these steps to create and customize a calculation model.

1. On the navigation pane, select **Operations** \> **Calculations**.
1. Select the calculation profile that you want to create or customize a calculation model for.
1. On the **Calculation Model** tab, there will always be at least one tile (of the *Input* type) at the top of the flow chart. The model is processed from top to bottom, and the last tile must be a tile of the *Save** type. Add, remove, and arrange tiles as you require, and configure settings for each of them. For guidelines, see the illustration after this procedure.
1. When you've finished designing your calculation model, select the **Validate** button :::image type="icon" source="media/button-validate-model.png" border="false"::: in the upper-right corner. The system runs a few tests to validate that your model will work, and then provides feedback. Fix any issues that the validation test reports.
1. Continue to work until your model is ready. Then, on the Action Pane, select **Save**.
1. If you want to save your calculation model as a preset, so that it's available when you and other users create a new calculation profile, select the **Save as model template** button :::image type="icon" source="media/button-save-model-as-template.png" border="false"::: in the upper-right corner.

The following illustration highlights the information and controls that are available for tiles in a calculation model.

Legend:

1. **Tile icon** – A symbol that represents the role of the tile.
1. **Tile type** – The type of tile. This text usually describes the type of calculation or other action that the tile represents.
1. **Tile name** – The name that's applied to the tile. Usually, you can manually enter this text in each tile's settings. However, some types of tiles have a predefined value here.
1. **Tile actions** – Open a menu of actions that you can take on the tile. Although some of these actions are specific to the tile type, many are common to all tiles. If any actions appear dimmed, they can't be used because of the tile's current position or for some other contextual reason. Here are some common actions that are available:

    - **Settings** – Open a dialog box where you can configure settings for the tile.
    - **Remove** – Remove the tile.
    - **Move Up** and **Move Down** – Reposition the tile in the flowchart.
    - **Set to 'Pass Through'** – Temporarily disable a currently enabled tile without deleting it or its settings.
    - **Unset 'Pass Through'** – Reenable a currently disabled tile.
    - **Connect with** – For tiles that support multiple inputs, specify the second input. The first input is automatically set based on where you put the tile.

1. **Add a tile** – Add a new tile at the selected location. (If you insert a new *Input* tile, that tile will always be put at the top of a new flow, not at the button location.)

## Calculation tile types

This section describes the purpose of each type of calculation tile. It also explains how to use and configure each type.

### Input tiles

Each *Input* tile represents a time series that provides input to the calculation model.

A name is automatically assigned to each *Input* tile that you add. This name includes an integer that matches an index ID of a time series that's listed on the **Included** tab of the **Input Data** tab (for example, *Time Series 1* or *Time Series 2*). You can't edit the name.

*Input* tiles have just one field that you can set: **Fill missing values**.

### Arithmetic operator tiles

*Arithmetic operator* tiles do a calculation that combines values from two input time series. You might use this type of tile, for example, to calculate the expected margins of a forecast by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the expected revenue.

*Arithmetic operator* tiles implement the following calculation:

f(x) = a(x) &lt;*operator*&gt; b(x)

In this formula, &lt;*operator*&gt; is one of the following arithmetic operators: \+, \-, \*, or /.

You can use this type of tile only if your calculation model has at least two input time series in parallel columns. The first series is at the top of the column where you create the tile. The second series must start with an *Input* tile. It can have any number of tiles in it, but it must still be open. (In other words, it must not end with a *Save* tile.) To specify the second series, open the tile's **Action** menu, and select **Connect with**. The flowchart is then updated so that it shows the two columns combining at the *Arithmetic operator* tile.

*Arithmetic operator* tiles have the following fields that you can set:

- **Step name** – The specific name of the tile. This name is also shown in the flowchart.
- **Description** – A short description of the tile.
- **Crated by** – The user who created the tile.
- **Value 1** – The first series in the calculation (*a(x)*), which is on the left side of the operator. Select *Input 1* or *Input 2*.
- **Operator** – The operator that's applied between the first series (**Value 1**) and the second series (**Value 2**). Select whether to add (\+), subtract (\-), multiply (\*), or divide (/).
- **Value 2** – The second series in the calculation (*b(x)*), which is on the right side of the operator. Select *Input 1* or *Input 2*.

### Constant arithmetic operator tiles

*Constant arithmetic operator* tiles do a calculation that applies a constant arithmetic operation to each value in an input time series.

*Constant arithmetic operator* tiles implement the following calculation:

f(x) = a(x) &lt;*operator*&gt; C

In this formula:

- &lt;*Operator*&gt; is one of the following arithmetic operators: \+, \-, \*, or /.
- *C* is a constant value.

*Constant arithmetic operator* tiles have the following fields that you can set:

- **Step name** – The specific name of the tile. This name is also shown in the flowchart.
- **Description** – A short description of the tile.
- **Crated by** – The user who created the tile.
- **Value 1** – The first series in the calculation (*a(x)*), which is on the left side of the operator. Select *Input 1* or *Input 2*.
- **Operator** – The operator that's applied. Select whether to add (\+), subtract (\-), multiply (\*), or divide (/).
- **Constant** – The constant value that's applied to each time series value by using the selected operator.

### Date offset tiles

*Date offset* tiles shift the input time series by a fixed value along the x-axis. You might use this type of tile, for example, to shift last year's demand one year forward, so that you can compare it to next year's forecast by overlaying the time-shifted demand graph on the forecast graph.

*Date offset* tiles implement the following calculation:

f(x) = a(x &minus; t)

In this formula, *t* is an integer that represents the number of days, months, or years.

*Date offset* tiles have the following fields that you can set:

- **Step name** – The specific name of the tile. The name is also shown in the flowchart.
- **Description** – A short description of the tile.
- **Crated by** – The user who created the tile.
- **Time value** – The amount of time to shift the input time series forward by. The amount is in the unit that's specified in the **Time unit** field.
- **Time unit** – The unit that applies to the time value.

### Logical operator tiles

*Logical operator* tiles test whether a value exceeds a constant (threshold) at each point along a time series. As output, it returns a *1* for true and a *0* (zero) for false. You might use this type of tile, for example, to evaluate when the forecast error is above a specific threshold in either direction, so that you can focus on important products.

*Logical operator* tiles implement the following calculation:

f(x) = ABS\[a(x)\] &lt;*operator*&gt; C

In this formula:

- &lt;*Operator*&gt; is one of the following logical operators: &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, or &lt;=.
- *C* is a constant.
- *ABS* is optional. If it's enabled, the absolute value (that is, the distance from zero) is used instead of the literal value.

*Logical operator* tiles have the following fields that you can set:

- **Step name** – The specific name of the tile. The name is also shown in the flowchart.
- **Description** – A short description of the tile.
- **Crated by** – The user who created the tile.
- **Apply ABS** – Set this option to *Yes* to use the absolute value (distance from zero) of the input series. Set it to *No* to use the literal value (including +/\- signs) of the input series.
- **Operator** – The logical operator that's applied for the comparison against the constant value.
- **Constant** – The constant value to compare against the input time series.

### Merge tiles

*Merge* tiles merge two time series into a new time series by applying the selected merge logic. You can merge the time series by minimum value, maximum value, average, or sum. You might use this type of tile, for example, to calculate a merged result of two forecast methods.

You can use this type of tile only if your calculation model has at least two input time series in parallel columns. The first series is at the top of the column where you create the tile. The second series must start with an *Input* tile. It can have any number of tiles in it, but it must still be open. (In other words, it must not end with a *Save* tile.) To specify the second series, open the tile's **Action** menu, and select **Connect with**. The flowchart is then updated so that it shows the two columns combining at the *Merge* tile.

*Merge* tiles have just one field that you can set: **Merge policy**. Select one of the following values:

- *Min value* – Take the lowest of the two input values.
- *Max value* – Take the largest of the two input values.
- *Average* – Calculate the average of the two input values.
- *Sum* – Add the two input values together.

### Monetary value tiles

*Monetary value* tiles convert a forecast or historical demand time series that's based on sales units into a series of monetary values that are based on a selected price list. The calculation first tries to match the cost or price from a primary price list. It then tries a fallback price list if one is selected. You might use this type of tile, for example, to convert a forecast (quantity) into expected revenue (monetary value).

*Monetary value* tiles implement the following calculation:​

f(x) = a(x) &times; Price(product-ID)

*Monetary value* tiles have the following fields that you can set:

- **Step name** – The specific name of the tile. The name is also shown in the flowchart.
- **Description** – A short description of the tile.
- **Crated by** – The user who created the tile.
- **Primary price list** – Select the primary data table that contains your price list. The list includes all the tables that are currently defined for use with Demand planning. (For more information, see [Set up tables](import-data.md).) The price list must include columns for product IDs and prices.
- **Fallback price list** – If the system can't find a matching price in the primary price list, it checks any price list that you select here.

### Ratio in percentage tiles

*Ratio in percentage* tiles calculate a ratio in percentage, based on two input time series. You might use this type of tile, for example, to calculate the error percentage of a previous forecast, based on a historical demand and forecast time series.

*Ratio in percentage* tiles implement the following calculation:​

f(x) = &Sigma; \{\[a(x) &minus; b(x)\] &divide; a(x)\} &times; 100 %

You can use this type of tile only if your calculation model has at least two input time series in parallel columns. The first series is at the top of the column where you create the tile. The second series must start with an *Input* tile. It can have any number of tiles in it, but it must still be open. (In other words, it must not end with a *Save* tile). To specify the second series, open the tile's **Action** menu, and select **Connect with**. The flowchart is then updated so that it shows the two columns combining at the *Ratio in percentage* tile.

*Ratio in percentage* tiles have the following fields that you can set:

- **Step name** – The specific name of the tile. This name is also shown in the flowchart.
- **Description** – A short description of the tile.
- **Crated by** – The user who created the tile.
- **Value 1** – The first series in the calculation (*a(x)*). Select *Input 1* or *Input 2*.
- **Value 2** – The second series in the calculation (*b(x)*). Select *Input 1* or *Input 2*.

### Save tiles

*Save* tiles save the result of the calculation model as a new or updated series. All calculation models must end with a single *Save* tile.

The calculated series will be saved according to the settings that you configure each time that you run a calculation job as described in [Work with calculation profiles](calculation-profiles.md).
