# Copilot grid cursor

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The *Copilot grid cursor* offers detailed insights into a selected time-series cell's value, including its original value, manual adjustments, and full adjustment history. User comments are also shown, to help make the changes easier to understand.

To use the Copilot grid cursor, follow these steps:

1. Open the time series that you want to analyze. For example, on the navigation pane, select **Planning data** \> **Forecasts**, and then select the time series.
1. In the **Time series values section**, find and select the cell that you want to analyze. After you select the cell, the Copilot grid cursor icon appears to the right of the cell and points to it.

1. Use the following features of the **Cell analysis** dialog to analyze the selected cell:

    - **Summary** – At the top of the dialog, you can see a summary of the cell's value and its history.
    - **Breakdown** – Select this button to see a graph that shows how the cell's value has been adjusted over time. The previous screenshot shows an example that indicates (from left to right) the baseline value (primary input), the signal impact, manual adjustments, and the current final value of a selected cell.
    - **Adjustment history** – Select this button to see a timeline that lists each time the cell was edited. To read the comments associated with a listed event, select the **Show details** button for the relevant row.

1. When you're done exploring the cell history, select the **Close** button in the upper-right corner of the dialog.
