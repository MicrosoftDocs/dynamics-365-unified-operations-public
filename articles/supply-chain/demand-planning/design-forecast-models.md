*Forecast models* let you arrange and configure tiles to define the forecast that's made by a forecast profile. Each model presents a flowchart that graphically represents the calculation that the model does.

## <a name="forecasting-algorithms"></a>Demand forecasting algorithms

Demand planning includes three popular demand forecasting algorithms: *auto-ARIMA*, *ETS*, and *prophet*. The demand forecasting algorithm that you use depends on the specific characteristics of your historical data.

- Auto-ARIMA works best when data follows stable patterns.
- ETS is a versatile choice for data that has trends or seasonality.
- Prophet works best with complex, real-world data.

By understanding these algorithms and their strengths, you can make informed decisions to optimize your supply chain and meet customer demand.

This section describes how each algorithm works and its suitability for different types of historical demand data.

### Auto-ARIMA: The time traveler's delight

The auto-ARIMA algorithm is like a time machine: it takes you on a journey through past demand patterns so that you can make informed predictions about the future. Auto-ARIMA uses a technique that's known as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). This technique combines three key components: autoregression, differencing, and moving averages. The auto-ARIMA algorithm automatically identifies the best combination of these components to create a forecast model that suits your data.

Auto-ARIMA works especially well with time series data that shows a stable pattern over time, such as seasonal fluctuations or trends. If your historical demand follows a reasonably consistent path, auto-ARIMA might be your preferred forecasting method.

### ETS: The shape shifter

ETS is a versatile demand forecasting algorithm that adapts to the shape of your data. It can change its approach based on the characteristics of your historical demand. Therefore, it's suitable for a wide range of scenarios.

The name ETS is an abbreviation for the three essential components that the algorithm decomposes the time series data into: error, trend, and seasonality. By understanding and modeling these components, ETS generates forecasts that capture the underlying patterns in your data. It works best with data that shows clear seasonal patterns, trends, or both. Therefore, it's an excellent choice for businesses that have seasonally affected products or services.

### Prophet: The visionary forecasting guru

Prophet was developed by Facebook's research team. It's a modern and flexible forecasting algorithm that can handle the challenges of real-world data. It's especially effective at handling missing values, outliers, and complex patterns.

Prophet works by decomposing the time series data into several components, such as trend, seasonality, and holidays, and then fitting a model to each component. This approach enables Prophet to accurately capture the nuances in your data and produce reliable forecasts. Prophet is ideal for businesses that have irregular demand patterns or frequent outliers, or businesses that are affected by special events such as holidays or promotions.

### Best fit model

The best fit model uses machine learning to determine which of the other available algorithms best fits your data for each product and dimension combination. In this way, different models can be used for different products.

### Custom Azure Machine Learning algorithm

If you have a custom Microsoft Azure Machine Learning algorithm that you want to use with your forecasting models, you can use it in the Demand planning app.

## Create and customize a forecast model

To create and customize a forecast model, you must first open an existing forecast profile. (For more information, see [Work with forecast profiles](forecast-profiles.md).) You can then fully customize the model that the selected profile uses by adding, removing, and arranging tiles, and configuring settings for each of them.

Follow these steps to create and customize a forecast model.

1. On the navigation pane, select **Operations** \> **Forecast profiles**.
1. Select the forecast profile that you want to create or customize a forecast model for.
1. On the **Forecast model** tab, there will always be at least one tile (of the *Input* type) at the top of the flow chart. The model is processed from top to bottom, and the last tile must be a tile of the *Save* type. Add, remove, and arrange tiles as you require, and configure settings for each of them. For guidelines, see the illustration after this procedure.
1. When you've finished designing your forecast model, select the **Validate** button :::image type="icon" source="media/button-validate-model.png" border="false"::: in the upper-right corner. The system runs a few tests to validate that your model will work, and then provides feedback. Fix any issues that the validation test reports.
1. Continue to work until your model is ready. Then, on the Action Pane, select **Save**.
1. If you want to save your forecast model as a preset, so that it's available when you and other users create a new forecast profile, select the **Save as model template** button :::image type="icon" source="media/button-save-model-as-template.png" border="false"::: in the upper-right corner.

The following illustration shows the information and controls that are available for tiles in a forecast model.

:::image type="content" source="media/forecast-flowchart-elements.svg" alt-text="Screenshot that shows forecast model elements." lightbox="media/forecast-flowchart-elements.svg":::

Legend:

1. **Tile icon** – A symbol that represents the purpose of the tile.
1. **Tile type** – The type of tile. This text usually describes the type of roles, calculations, or other actions that the tile represents.
1. **Tile name** – The name that's applied to the tile. Sometimes, you can enter manually this text in the tile's settings. However, it usually indicates the value of one of the settings that were configured for the tile.
1. **Tile actions** – Open a menu of actions that you can take on the tile. Although some of these actions are specific to the tile type, most are common to all tiles. If any actions appear dimmed, they can't be used because of the tile's current position or for some other contextual reason. Here are some common actions that are available:

    - **Settings** – Open a dialog box where you can configure settings for the tile.
    - **Remove** – Remove the tile.
    - **Move Up** and **Move Down** – Reposition the tile in the flowchart.
    - **Set to 'Pass Through'** – Temporarily disable a currently enabled tile without deleting it or its settings.
    - **Unset 'Pass Through'** – Reenable a currently disabled tile.

1. **Add a tile** – Add a new tile at the selected location.

## Forecast tile types

This section describes the purpose of each type of forecast tile. It also explains how to use and configure each type.

### Input tiles

*Input* tiles represent the time series that provides input to the forecast model. The time series is the one that's listed on the **Included** tab of the **Input Data** tab. You can't edit the name.

*Input* tiles have just one field that you can set: **Fill missing values**.

### Handle outliers tiles

*Handle outliers* tiles identify and compensate for outlier data points in the input. These data points are considered anomalies that should be ignored or smoothed out to prevent them from throwing off the forecast calculation.

*Handle outliers* tiles have the following fields that you can set:

- **Handle outliers** – Select one of the following options:

    - *Interquartile range (IQR)*
    - *Seasonal and trend decomposition using loess (STL)*

- **Interquartile range multiplier** – This field is available only when the **Handle outliers** field is set to *IQR*.
- **Correction methods** – This field is available only when the **Handle outliers** field is set to *IQR*.
- **Seasonality hint** – This field is available only when the **Handle outliers** field is set to *STL*.

### Forecast tiles

*Forecast* tiles apply a selected forecast algorithm to the input time series to create a forecast time series.

*Forecast* tiles have just one field that you can set: **Model type**. Use it to select the forecast algorithm to use. For more information about each of the available algorithms, see the [Demand forecasting algorithms](#forecasting-algorithms) section. Select one of the following algorithms:

- *ARIMA* – Autoregressive integrated moving average
- *ETS* – Error, trend, seasonality
- *Prophet* – Facebook Prophet
- *Best fit model*

## Finance and operations – Azure Machine Learning tiles

If you're already using your own Azure Machine Learning algorithms for demand forecasting in Supply Chain Management (as described in [Demand forecasting overview](../master-planning/introduction-demand-forecasting.md)), you can continue to use them while you use the Demand planning app. Just put a *Finance and operations – Azure Machine Learning* tile in your forecast model instead of a *Forecast* tile.

For information about how to set up the Demand planning app to connect to and use your Azure Machine Learning algorithms, see [Use your own custom Azure Machine Learning algorithms in Demand planning (preview)](custom-azure-machine-learning-algorithms.md).

### Save tiles

*Save* tiles save the result of the forecast model as a new or updated series. All forecast models must end with a single *Save* tile.

The forecast time series will be saved according to the settings that you configure each time that you run a forecast job as described in [Work with forecast profiles](forecast-profiles.md).
