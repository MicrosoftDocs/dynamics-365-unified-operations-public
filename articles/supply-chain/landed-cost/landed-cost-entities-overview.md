# Landed cost entities overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The **Landed cost** module helps businesses streamline inbound shipping operations by providing complete financial and logistical control over imported freight, from the manufacturer to the warehouse. Transaction data entities for Landed cost enable external data sources (such as freight forwarder services) to create voyages and costs, and update container tracking records.

Here are some of the supported operations:

- Create and update voyage, shipping container, and folio records for existing inbound order lines.
- Create and update estimated costs for each cost area.
- Create and update shipping container activity records to capture the start date, estimated end date, and actual end date for each leg of the container's journey.
- Create vendor cost invoice allocations.
