# Turn on the Landed cost module for your system

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Before you can use the Landed cost module, it must be turned on in your system. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of the feature and turn it on as needed. In the **Feature management** workspace, the feature is listed in the following way:

- **Module:** *Transportation management*
- **Feature name:** *Landed cost*
