# Order-Level Attribute-Based Pricing in Unified Pricing Management

## Purpose
To extend the flexibility and precision of Unified Pricing Management by allowing sales order-level attributes (from header and line) to be used as pricing rule criteria.  
This enables differentiated pricing based on order characteristics such as **order type, mode of delivery, or order line warranty types**. 

## Feature Overview
With Unified Pricing Management enabled, this feature allows users to define **order-specific price rules** based on Sales Order Header and Line attributes.

## Key Benefits
- Enables differentiated pricing by order context (e.g., **online vs. bulk order vs. sample order**)  
- Supports more granular and automated pricing scenarios  
- Simplifies the setup of order-type-specific pricing strategies  

## Feature Configuration

### Pre-Requisite
- Unified Pricing Management must be enabled  

### Setup Steps

1. **Navigate to Price Management Parameters**  
   - Define:  
     - *Order Header Attribute Group*  
     - *Order Line Attribute Group*  
   - These groups will reference order-related attributes (e.g., **Order Type, Delivery Mode, Order Style**, etc.)  

2. **Create Pricing Rules in Trade Agreements**  
   - When creating Trade Agreement Prices or Discount Rules, users can now select criteria from the assigned attribute groups.  
   - Order header attributes will belong to the **header attribute group**, while order line attributes will belong to the **line attribute group**.  

3. **Attribute Values as Filters**  
   - Attribute values act as filters that determine rule applicability.  
   - When entering the order in **Headquarters or POS**, you can assign the attribute value to the order.  
   - For **POS user experience**, you may need to configure the UI to enable value assignment at POS.  
   - The pricing engine will check pricing rules with matching attribute criteria.
