# Allow Net Price in Unified Pricing Management

## Purpose
To support negotiated final prices in Trade Agreements within Unified Pricing Management (UPM), by allowing sales prices to be defined directly with or without price adjustments and explicitly preventing additional discount applications.  
This ensures accurate discount-exempt pricing aligned with contractual or wholesale pricing needs.

## Feature Description
When Unified Pricing Management is enabled, this function enhances the Sales Trade Agreement pricing experience by allowing pricing administrators to define:

- A final exclusive net price that reflects the outcome of negotiation  
- Whether price adjustments (e.g., percentage increases or decreases) are included  
- Whether promotional or system-applied discounts should be prevented from further affecting the transaction price  

This capability is especially relevant in **B2B, channel sales, or regulated pricing models**, where the agreed price should not be altered by discount logic.

| Net Price Definition   | Define Trade Agreement Sales Price as a net (final, exclusive) price that is not subject to further discounting by selecting `Allow Price Adjustment = No` and `Prevent Discount = Yes`. |

## Key Use Cases
- **B2B or Wholesale Pricing** where negotiated prices must be honored without promotional interference.  
- **Long-term Contracts** requiring strict adherence to fixed pricing, which exclude further discounts.
