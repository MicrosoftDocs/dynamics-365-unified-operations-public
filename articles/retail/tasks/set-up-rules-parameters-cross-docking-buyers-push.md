This procedure demonstrates the steps to create Replenishment rules. Replenishment rules can be used to control how products are distributed to stores when using Cross-docking and Buyer´s push. Replenishment rules can be set up for stores or store groups. The weight defined for each line in a rule will control how the quantities of products will get distributed between the stores when using Replenishment rules as the distribution method in Cross-docking or Buyer´s push. This procedure uses the USRT demo company.
