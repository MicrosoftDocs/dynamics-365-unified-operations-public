[!include[task guide banner](../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure walks through the steps to create and process a Buyer´s push to distribute products from one location to one or many stores. The user can define multiple configurations and have the system suggest how to distribute the products, or manually enter where the products are distributed to and how much gets distributed to each store. This procedure doesn't include setup of data that can be used in the Buyer´s push, such as replenishment rules, organizational hierarchies, and store weights. This procedure uses the USRT demo company.
