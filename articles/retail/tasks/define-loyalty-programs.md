# Define loyalty programs

[!include[task guide banner](../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

This procedure shows how to set up a loyalty program with two loyalty tiers. This procedure uses the USRT demo data company.

1. Go to Retail and commerce > .. > Loyalty programs.
2. Click New.
3. In the Name field, type a value.
4. In the Description field, type a value.
5. Click Add line.
6. In the Level field, enter a number.
7. In the Tier field, enter a name for the loyalty tier.
8. In the Description field, type a value.
9. In the Date interval field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.
    * This date interval should extend into the future. For example, if the date interval that is selected for gold tier is a one-year period, any customer who qualifies for the gold tier can receive the rewards that are assigned to the gold tier for one year. If the customer re-qualifies for the gold tier while they are in the tier, the date that the tier expires is extended by another year from the date when they re-qualify.  
10. In the list, click the link in the selected row.
11. Click Add line.

13. In the Tier field, enter a name for the loyalty tier.

19. Toggle the expansion of the Tier rules section.
20. Click New.
    * You can have more than one tier rule per tier. For example, you could have three different criteria to earn a tier; by spending $500 in one month, by spending $1000 over one year, and by having 20 transactions in one year. To do this, you would need to create three tier rules.  
21. In the Reward point field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.
    * This should be a non-redeemable loyalty reward point.  
22. In the list, click the link in the selected row.
23. In the Minimum issued points field, enter a number.
    * For the lowest level tier, if all customers qualify simply by participating in the program, enter '0'.  
24. In the Evaluation date interval field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.
