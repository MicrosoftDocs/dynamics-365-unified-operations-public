# Commerce Data Exchange best practices
This topic is intended for people who implement functionality that is related to data synchronization (Commerce Data Exchange, often known as CDX) in a Commerce environment. It gives best practices advice for implementations.

## Overview
Data configuration and synchronization is crucial to a proper implementation.  Regardless of business needs, IT infrastructure, and overall preparedness, if data is not being correctly synchronized, the entire environment is effectively useless.  As such, it is top priority to understand what is required to configure, generate, synchronize, and verify data synchronization across a full implementation. From Headquarters, through the Commerce Scale Unit, to the brick and mortar stores utilizing Modern POS and other in-store components.

Before going through this document, it is important to know the concepts of a channel (Store), registers and devices, and the concept of the offline database as a part of Modern POS.  As such, it is recommended to review some of the resources at the bottom of this document such as the Devices implementation guide and the Commerce architecture documents.

This document is organized in tables with tag-like associated areas to make it easier to quickly find best practices related to areas of concern.  For new implementations it might be useful to copy out these tables into a location where the various best practices could be checked off as completed to make certain that the implementation is prepared as well as possible prior to ever moving forward to production.

### Valuable configurations
| Associated areas | Best practice |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Parameters, Commerce scheduler, Retry | Navigate to **Retail and Commerce > Headquarters setup > Parameters > Commerce scheduler parameters** and set the **Try count** value to **3**.  Having this value too high could potentially cause a download session to fail during high usage times. |
| Functionality profile, Data retention, Return policy | **Retail and Commerce > Channel setup > POS setup > POS profiles > Functionality profile**, under the **Functions** sub-heading, and set the **Days transactions exist** value to the same or near the value of the return policy (For example, if the return policy states an item may be returned in 30 days or less, then set this value to 30, 31, or 60). |
| Channel database group, Distribution schedule, Offline profile, Pause, Data, Download | It is highly recommended to either have a dummy Channel database group (Which is not associated to any distribution schedule job) to assign to the newly generated terminals or a special Offline profile where the configuration Pause offline synchronization is set to value Yes. This will allow data generation to occur when required and when the system is most available to do so (Potentially pausing multiple times, as required). |

### Performance impacting practices
| Associated areas | Best practice |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Channel database group, Offline profile, Pause, Data, Download | Do not generate data for offline databases until that data is required for use of an offline database. Here is a scenario to highlight why this is important.  A new Modern POS offline database (Added to the relevant Channel database group) inherits all existing download sessions since the last full database sync occurred.  Imagine the creation of 100 new Modern POS with offline terminals occurs and a full sync has not occurred in two months.  Let's assume only five different scheduler jobs have actual changes every 20 minutes (For example, prices and discounts or customers, which can be updated frequently). This generates immediately a potential of 2,000,000 (Two million) download sessions to be applied, regardless of whether the newly created terminals are activated and capable of applying this data. This sort of exceptional data generation is large and performance impacting at the best possible times and crippling to the environment performance at the worst (Busiest) times. As such, it is highly recommended to either have a dummy Channel database group (Which is not associated to any distribution schedule job) to assign to the newly generated terminals. Alternatively, use the **Offline profile** configuration **Pause offline synchronization**. Setting this configuration to **Yes** will stop data generation for anything using this **Offline profile**. Doing so will allow data generation to occur when required (As opposed to constantly) and also when the system is most available to do so (Potentially pausing multiple times, as required). |
| Distribution schedule, Scheduler jobs, Upload | No more than one P-job (Upload job) should occur at any moment in time. Creating multiple P-job upload batch jobs that could occur in parallel could potentially cause table locking and delays (Performance degradation) while performing the application of data of the uploaded transactions. The job can occur frequently but does not need to occur multiple times at the same time. |
