## Clienteling
Many retailers, especially high-end specialty retailers, want their sales associates to form long term relationships with their key customers. The sales associates are expected to know about their customer's likes and dislikes, purchase history, product preferences, important dates such as anniversary, birthday etc. The associates need a place to capture such information and easily find the information when needed. Once this information is available in a single view, then the associates can easily target the customers that meet certain criteria for e.g. find all the customers that prefer to shop for Handbags, find customers for whom an important live event such as birthday, anniversary, graduation etc. is approaching. The new clienteling capabilities in in Dynamics 365 Retail can help your associates easily build and maintain such relationships.

## Tender based discounts
It has now become a common practice for retailers to release private branded credit cards. Retailers benefit from getting preferred rates from the banks, and according to a study, such credits cards result in an increase in the store visit frequency, thus directly improving the bottom line of the retailer. So, retailers are motivated to increase the usage frequency of such credit cards. To achieve this goal, retailers often provide additional discounts for using these cards.With this feature, the retailers can configure a discount percentage that would be applied on the qualified lines if the user pays using the preferred tender.  

## Hardware station mass deployment
As companies increase in size, massive deployment and installation of components, such as hardware station, has become relatively unmanageable. This feature will not only dramatically reduce the difficulty of initial and long-term deployment and maintenance, it will enhance the flow of hardware station which increases reliability and resiliency.  This new feature allows users to silently perform a mass deployment of the hardware station. Retailers can choose the deployment tool of their choice (such as System Center) to deploy and service this component. This will provide improvements to reliability and resiliency over time for the hardware station on top of the enhanced speed and ease with which deployment occurs.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features](../../dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
