# Application Explorer properties

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article describes the properties that appear in the Properties window of Microsoft Visual Studio for items in Application Explorer.

Many nodes in Application Explorer represent elements that have properties associated with them. You can read or modify these properties in the **Properties** window of Microsoft Visual Studio.

## System and common properties
Most application objects in Application Explorer have a standard set of system properties. These system properties are read-only. You can use the **Properties** window to view the properties for any item in Application Explorer. To open the **Properties** window, right-click a node in Application Explorer, and then click **Properties**. On the **Categories** tab of the **Properties** window, many system properties are listed under the **Statistics** node. This article lists additional common properties that are repeated on many, but not all, Application Explorer nodes. The following table shows the system properties that are found on almost all Application Explorer nodes. All these system properties are read-only.

| Property     | Description                                                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ChangedBy    | The user who last changed the object (often the release version). |
| ChangedDate  | The date when the object was last changed.                        |
| ChangedTime  | The time when the object was last changed.                        |
| CreatedBy    | The user who created the object.                                  |
| CreationDate | The date when the object was created.                             |
| CreationTime | The time when the object was created.                             |

The following table shows other common properties that are found on many, but not all, Application Explorer nodes.

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ConfigurationKey  | Specify the configuration key that controls access to or display of an element. If a user doesn't have access to the configuration key, the element isn't visible. Elements include pages, controls on pages, tables, and other elements.                                                                            |
| LegacyID          | An identifier element from an earlier version. During upgrade from a previous version, the old identifier is assigned to **LegacyID**. An installation-specific identifier isn't assigned, and business logic remains intact. This property isn't used for new elements.                                             |
| NeededAccessLevel | The minimum access level that a user requires. This property is read-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Origin            | The globally unique identifier (GUID) of an Application Explorer element. This property is used to identify elements during synchronization and in upgrade scenarios. It's a read-only property, and the value never changes after the system assigns it. No origin GUID value is duplicated anywhere in the system. |
| SecurityKey       | This property is obsolete but is retained for reference in systems that were upgraded from an earlier version.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

<td>IgnoreEDTRelation</td>
<td>This property is used during the migration of EDT relations. When you migrate relations from an EDT node to a table node, you can skip an invalid relation for a given table field. To skip invalid relations, set this property to <strong>Yes</strong>. The default value is <strong>No</strong>.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Label</td>
<td>Specify a label for the field. This label will appear on pages and reports. Also see the description of the <strong>AnalysisLabel</strong> property earlier in this table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Mandatory</td>
<td>Specify whether a user must add data to a field on a page. Set this property to <strong>Yes</strong> to indicate that the default or initialization value for each data type isn't acceptable for persistence into the database. The following list shows some default values that can't be used for mandatory fields on a page:
<ul>
<li>Empty isn't acceptable for a str (string) field.</li>
<li>The minimum date-time isn't acceptable for date-time fields such as date and utcdatetime.</li>
<li>A value of 0 (zero) isn't acceptable for numeric fields such as int, real, and enum.</li>
</ul>
Finance and Operations doesn't support the semantics for the <strong>null</strong> value that is standard in most SQL database products. Field can't be nulled in the database. Therefore, the <strong>Mandatory</strong> property has nothing to do with the concept of a <strong>null</strong> value. <strong>Caution:</strong> A mandatory table field can have its <strong>EnumType</strong> property set to an enumeration. You might define a field as an enum type that includes an item that has the integer value <strong>0</strong>. In this case, <strong>0</strong> isn't an item that's available for selection on the page. The forms system automatically calls the <strong>validateWrite</strong> method to enforce the setting of the <strong>Mandatory</strong> property. However, the <strong>Mandatory</strong> property has no effect on the behavior of direct X++ SQL that inserts or updates the value of a table field. In your direct X++ SQL, you can include calls to the <strong>validateWrite</strong> method on your table buffer variable. Your buffer variable inherits the method from the <strong>xRecord</strong> class.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>MinReadAccess</td>
<td>Specify the mode of the automatic authorization feature. Automatic authorization has two modes of operation: surrogate foreign key and lookup. If a table in a query is tagged for surrogate foreign key authorization, and the user doesn't have access to that table but hasn't been explicitly denied, view access is granted to the table. However, not all fields will be visible. The visibility is determined by the following rules:
<ul>
<li>If <strong>MinReadAccess</strong> is set to <strong>No</strong>, no access is granted to the field.</li>
<li>If <strong>MinReadAccess</strong> is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, view access is granted to the field.</li>
<li>Otherwise, view access is granted if the field is part of the natural key automatic identification group, if it's a title field, or if it's a system field.</li>
</ul>
If a table in a query is tagged for lookup authorization, access is determined by the following rules:
<ul>
<li>If <strong>MinReadAccess</strong> is set to <strong>No</strong>, no access is granted to the field.</li>
<li>Otherwise, view access is granted to the field.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Model</td>
<td>Specify the model that the table field is in. A model is a logical grouping of elements in a layer. Examples of elements include a table or class. An element can exist in exactly one model in a layer. The same element can exist in a customized version in a model that is in a higher layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Name</td>
<td>Specify the name of the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>RelationContext</td>
<td>Specify the mapping of a field to a specific table relation. Typically, this property is used in unit-of-measure scenarios to model data that is related to currency codes or quantities. The relation that is associated with the field can then be used to show a lookup of currency codes or quantities. There is no default value.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SaveContents</td>
<td>Specify whether the field data is saved in the database or treated as virtual field data. Virtual field data is calculated at run time when the field is displayed. This data has no physical representation in the database. <strong>Tip:</strong> Instead of virtual fields, you can use display and edit methods.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>StringSize</td>
<td>Set the field length, in the number of characters. The maximum field length depends on the database. A value of <strong>(Memo)</strong> indicates that the field length is unlimited.</td>

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AllowDuplicates       | If you set this property to **Yes**, the index can be non-unique. If you don't create at least one unique index, Finance and Operations creates a unique index by combining the first index and the RecId.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| AlternateKey          | Specify whether this index is part of an alternate key. The index field must have a unique value in every record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ConfigurationKey      | Set the configuration key. An index field that is disabled through a configuration key is automatically removed from the index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Enabled               | You can use this property to disable the index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ID                    | The internal identifier of the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Model                 | Specify the model that the table index is in. A model is a logical grouping of elements in a layer. Examples of elements include a table or class. An element can exist in exactly one model in a layer. The same element can exist in a customized version in a model that is in a higher layer.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Name                  | Specify the index name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| UniqueAcrossCompanies | This property is for internal Microsoft use only. The available values are **Yes** and **No**. The default value is **No**. The value of this property is ignored when the **AllowDuplicates** property is set to **No**. However, when **AllowDuplicates** is set to **Yes**, a value of **Yes** for **UniqueAcrossCompanies** can improve the performance of some cross-company queries. The performance improvement is caused by changes to the caching of data. |
| ValidTimeStateKey     | Specify whether this index key is used to determine the valid time state relationship with the parent table. The default value is **No**. **Tip:** To enable this property, you must set the **AllowDuplicates** property to **No** and the **AlternateKey** property to **Yes**.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ValidTimeStateMode    | Specify whether gaps are allowed between two date-effective records. The default value is **NoGap**. **Tip:** To enable this property, you must set the **AllowDuplicates** property to **No**, the **AlternateKey** property to **Yes**, and the **ValidTimeStateKey** property to **Yes**.                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Note:** Pages sort on the first index.

## Table relation properties
### List of properties

The following table describes the properties for a table relation in Application Explorer.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cardinality</td>
<td>The number of times that each primary key value from the referenced table must occur in the foreign key column of the current table. For example, the <strong>OneMore</strong> value means one or more, but not zero. This value indicates that every parent key value must occur in the child table's foreign key column at least one time. A relation node under a SalesLine table might use the <strong>OneMore</strong> value when the business rule requires that every record in the parent SalesTable table relate to at least one item that is being sold. Currently, Finance and Operations doesn't use the <strong>Cardinality</strong> property. However, future releases might use this property and the <strong>RelatedTableCardinality</strong> property.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CreateNavigationPropertyMethods</td>
<td>A value of <strong>Yes</strong> instructs the system to generate navigation methods on the table buffer class for each foreign key relation node.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>EDTRelation</td>
<td>If the value is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, a software tool was used to migrate this relation to its current location from an old EDT relation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>EntityRelationshipRole</td>
<td>This property is used to clarify the semantics of a relationship that is defined on a table. A role name should be either a noun or a noun phrase. The role name should indicate the role of the associated table in relation to the associating object. Alternatively, the role name should be a short phrase that starts with a present-tense verb that indicates the role that the table plays in the relationship. Role names aren't required when the relationship is unambiguous.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Model</td>
<td>The model that this relation is part of.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Name</td>
<td>A descriptive name that you choose for the relation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>NavigationPropertyMethodNameOverride</td>
<td>Specify the name of the navigation method. If no value is specified, the navigation method uses the value from the <strong>RelatedTableRole</strong> property.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RelatedTableCardinality</td>
<td>Specify whether the foreign key field value in the current table can be <strong>null</strong> in some or all records of the current table. The following options are available:
<ul>
<li><strong>ZeroOne</strong> means zero or one. This value indicates that the foreign key field in a child record can be <strong>null</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>ExactlyOne</strong> indicates that the foreign key field can't be <strong>null</strong> in any child record.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>RelatedTableRole</td>
<td>Enter a text value to describe the purpose of the referenced parent table in this relationship. When a table has only one relation that references a given parent table, you can use the name of the parent table. Sometimes, a table has more than one relation to a given referenced parent table. this case, the value of the <strong>RelatedTableRole</strong> property should describe the relation well enough to distinguish the relation's purpose from the other relation to the same parent table. The value of this property can be used as the value of the <strong>JoinRelation</strong> property of a data source relation under an Application Explorer query. In standard cases, this usage is recommended, because it reduces denormalization. This property interacts with the <strong>UseDefaultRoleNames</strong> property.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RelationshipType</td>
<td>Select a value that describes the subtle relationship between two tables. For example, the <strong>Composition</strong> value indicates that the child record can't meaningfully exist unless it's related to a specific parent record. The record for the fourth floor in the Floor table can't exist unless it references a record in the parent Building table. <strong>Note:</strong> The DeleteActions should be compatible with this property setting. For a Composition relationship, the DeleteActions should include delete cascade behavior. Currently, Finance and Operations doesn't use the <strong>RelationshipType</strong> property. However, a future release might use this property.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Role</td>
<td>Specify a name that describes the meaning or role of the relation. For example, one relation to a Department table could track the department that the employee currently belongs to. Another relation could track the department that the employee has requested a transfer to. Although both these relations are relations to the Department table, they fill different roles. As the value of this property, it's a good idea to join the names of the child table and parent table by using an underscore (_) character. For example, enter <strong>SalesTable_SalesLine</strong>. This property interacts with the <strong>UseDefaultRoleNames</strong> property.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Table</td>
<td>The table that the relation refers to.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>UseDefaultRoleNames</td>
<td>A value of <strong>Yes</strong> indicates that the system must generate default values for the <strong>Role</strong> and <strong>RelatedTableRole</strong> properties. Even when this property is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, the values for that are generated for <strong>Role</strong> and <strong>RelatedTableRole</strong> don't appear in the <strong>Properties</strong> window. Additionally, the <strong>TreeNode</strong> class doesn't use the generate values. However, the <strong>DictRelation</strong> reflection class does use the generated values.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Validate</td>
<td>A value of <strong>Yes</strong> indicates that when a page inserts a record into the child table, the insertion is rejected unless the related record exists in the referenced parent table. Additionally, when a page deletes a record from the parent table, the deletion is either rejected or cascades to the related records in the child table. Set the value to <strong>No</strong> when the <strong>RelationshipType</strong> property is set to <strong>Link</strong>. You might also set the value to <strong>No</strong> in special temporary cases, such as during some upgrade scenarios. When the value is set back to <strong>Yes</strong>, no validation occurs for records that were inserted or deleted while the value was <strong>No</strong>. <strong>Caution:</strong> A value of <strong>Yes</strong> for the <strong>Validate</strong> property doesn't prevent direct X++ SQL data operations from deleting parent records or inserting child records that violate the integrity of foreign key data.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Note:** When the **SaveDataPerCompany** property is set to **Yes** for both tables, the system adds the **DataAreaId** field to each relationship.

### RelatedTableRole and query JoinRelation

This section describes how you can use the **RelatedTableRole** property to simplify the creation of a new query. If you enter an explicit value for the **RelatedTableRole** property on a table relation, you can use that value to populate the **JoinRelation** property on a data source relation under a **Queries** &gt; **MyQuery** node in Application Explorer. You can use this method to specify the fields of the join in one location. If the join fields ever change, you must update the join in only one location. Before you can set a value for the **JoinRelation** property, you must delete the values of the **Field** and **RelatedField** properties.

### CreateNavigationPropertyMethods and RelatedTableRole

When you set the **CreateNavigationPropertyMethods** property to **Yes** on a table relation, the system generates navigation methods for the table buffer class. A navigation method links two table buffer instances by using their foreign key relationship. The **UnitOfWork** class is one area where this navigation linkage is used. The name of a navigation method is copied from the value of the **RelatedTableRole** property on the table relation. This behavior is used when the **RelatedTableRole** value is explicitly set in the **Properties** window, and when the system generates the **RelatedTableRole** value because the **UseDefaultRoleNames** property is set to **Yes**. The property values generate the following navigation method on the child CustTable buffer. Most directly, the navigation method name is copied from the value of the **RelatedTableRole** property.

    public final CustBankAccount BankAccounts([CustBankAccount relatedTable])

#### NavigationPropertyMethodNameOverride property

The following list describes cases where you must override the name that the system generates for a navigation method on a table buffer class:

-   The table class already has a method name that matches the values of the **RelatedTableRole** property.
-   The value of the **RelatedTableRole** property exceeds the maximum length that can be used for a method name.

In these cases, you must choose a valid name for the navigation method and assign that name as the value of the **NavigationPropertyMethodNameOverride** property on the table relation.

## Understanding the RelationshipType enumeration
When you add a node under table relations, you can set the value of the **RelationshipType** property for the new relation. The list of possible values for the **RelationshipType** property is the list of elements in the **RelationshipType** enumeration. This section describes the meaning of each element in the **RelationshipType** enumeration.

### Description of elements

The following table describes the elements of the **RelationshipType** property.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Element name</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Automatic inference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>NotSpecified</td>
<td>This element is often the default value of the <strong>RelationshipType</strong> property.</td>
<td>When the <strong>RelationshipType</strong> property has a value of <strong>NotSpecified</strong>, the system infers an appropriate value. The system infers the value in the following sequence:
<ol>
<li>Specialization</li>
<li>Link</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Aggregation</li>
<li>Association</li>
</ol>
For example, if the criteria for both Composition and Aggregation are met, the system infers Composition, because Composition occurs earlier in the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Specialization</td>
<td>This element applies only to table inheritance, to relationships between base and derived tables.</td>
<td>The system sets the <strong>RelationshipType</strong> property to <strong>Specialization</strong> whenever table inheritance is involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Link</td>
<td>This element is a non-relational relationship. It requires that the <strong>Validate</strong> property be set to <strong>No</strong>. This type of relationship supports navigation between pages that list many records from a table and pages that provide detail fields for one record from the table.</td>
<td>Link is used only to support the migration of EDT link relations during upgrade from earlier versions. Migration tools create this type relationship, but you must not.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Composition</td>
<td>This element is a stronger type of Aggregation relation. A table must not have more than one Composition relation. For example, a building is composed of rooms, and a given room can't exist in more than one building.</td>
<td>If the criteria for Composition are met, but you manually assign a value of <strong>Aggregation</strong> or <strong>Association</strong>, the system leaves the value as <strong>Aggregation</strong> or <strong>Association</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Aggregation</td>
<td>This element is appropriate when the child table is considered subordinate to the entity of the parent table.</td>
<td>The system infers Aggregation when one of the following conditions is true:
<ul>
<li>The parent table has a delete action node that is defined to use this relation node.</li>
<li>Any foreign key field for this relation in the child table has the <strong>Mandatory</strong> property set to <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
If the criteria for Aggregation are met, but you manually assign a value of <strong>Association</strong>, the system leaves the value as <strong>Association</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Association</td>
<td>This element is the concept of a standard foreign key.</td>
<td>You must set the <strong>RelationshipType</strong> property to <strong>Association</strong> if the system doesn't set the value of the property to anything, and if both Aggregation and Composition are inappropriate.</td>
</tr>

## View properties
The properties for views are the same as the properties for tables. However, because views are read-only, most of their properties can't be changed. Some of these properties have fixed values, and some are inherited from the data sources that are used in the query that defines the view. The following properties for views are related to data analysis when you're using SSRS. All these properties can be changed.

-   AnalysisVisibility
-   AnalysisSelection
-   TypicalRowCount
-   IsLookup
-   SingularLabel

The following table describes the properties that can be set for a view.

<table>

<tr class="even">
<td>ConfigurationKey</td>
<td>Set the configuration key for the view.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>CountryRegionCodes</td>
<td>Specify the codes for the countries/regions where the menu is applicable or valid. This property is implemented as a comma-separated list of ISO country codes in a single string. The values must match data in the global address book. The client uses this property to enable or disable country/region-specific features.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CountryRegionContextField</td>
<td>Specify the field that is used to identify the country/region context. See the description of the <strong>CountryRegionCodes</strong> property.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>EntityRelationshipType</td>
<td>Classify a view according to common entity relationship (ER) data model notation. A view is classified as either an entity or a relationship. An entity represents an object, whereas a relationship represents an association between two objects.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>FormRef</td>
<td>Specify the default page for the view. The default page is the page that is shown when the user activates Jump to Main Table by using the shortcut menu for a field on a page. The page is referenced through a menu item of the <strong>Display</strong> type. If you leave this property blank, MorphX tries to activate a page that has the same name as the table that you're referring to.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ID</td>
<td>The internal identifier of the object.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Label</td>
<td>Specify a user-friendly name for the view.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ListPageRef</td>
<td>Specify a display menu item that points to a page that can show a list of this record type.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Model</td>
<td>Specify the model that the view is in. A model is a logical grouping of elements in a layer. An element can exist in exactly one model in a layer. The same element can exist in a customized version in a model that is in a higher layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Name</td>
<td>Specify the name of the view. This name is used when you refer to the view from the X++ language.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>PreviewPartRef</td>
<td>Specify the info part or form part to use in the enhanced preview. An info part shows a collection of data fields from a specified query. It uses metadata to describe how the data appears. A form part represents a pointer to a page.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>PrimaryIndex</td>
<td>Specify the primary index of the view. Only a unique index can be selected. This property is used for database optimization and to indicate which unique index should be used as the caching key. If you don't specify a primary index, the unique index that has the lowest ID is used as the caching key.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Query</td>
<td>Specify the query that is the source of data for the view. You can use this property instead of adding data sources directly to the view.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ReportRef</td>
<td>The name of the default report for the table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SaveDataPerCompany</td>
<td>Set this property to <strong>Yes</strong> for company-specific tables. Set it to <strong>No</strong> if the data is related to cross-companies, installation, a database, Application Explorer, tracing, or OLAP. For example, the SysTraceTable or OLAPServerTable table specifies whether data should be saved for that table on a per-company basis, or whether the data should be available without any company affiliation. If the <strong>SaveDataPerCompany</strong> property on a table is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, that table has a <strong>DataAreaId</strong> column that contains the company identifier. If the table property is set to <strong>No</strong>, the <strong>DataAreaId</strong> column is removed from the table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SaveDataPerPartition</td>
<td>A value that indicates whether the view has a system field that is named <strong>Partition</strong>. This property is intended to be read-only. If the view has a <strong>Partition</strong> field, each record is assigned to one partition. Each record is hidden from data access operations that are run under the context of other partitions.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SearchLinkRefName</td>
<td>The name of the menu item that links to information on a website about a table record that is listed in the Enterprise Portal search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SearchLinkRefType</td>
<td>The type of the menu item that links to information on a website about a table record that is listed in the Enterprise Portal search results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SystemTable</td>
<td>A value that indicates whether a table is a system table. System tables can be filtered during export and import, and are always synchronized when you sign in. Therefore, this property might be useful for tables that you use as soon as you sign in.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>TableContents</td>
<td>Specify how setup/parameter data can be reused from one customer to another. The following options are available:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not specified</strong> – Use this option for most tables.</li>

<li><strong>Base Data</strong> – Use this option for customer-dependent data, such as calendars, groups, and parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Default+Base data</strong> – Use this option for data where the local perception varies. For example, Chart of Accounts is customer-independent in Germany but is customer dependent in most other places.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>TableGroup</td>
<td>Specify the group that the view belongs to. Table groups categorize tables and views according to the type of data that they contain. Views can belong to the same table groups as a table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>TitleField1, TitleField2</td>
<td>The information that is shown in the window caption for the view. The caption is constructed from the following elements:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>TitleField1</strong> label, followed by colon (:) and a space</li>
<li>The value of the current record in the column that is used for <strong>TitleField1</strong>, followed by a comma (,)</li>
<li>The value of the current record in the column that is used for <strong>TitleField2</strong></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ValidTimeStateEnabled</td>
<td>Specify whether the view supports the valid time state feature of the underlying table. The default value is <strong>No</strong>. You can set this property to <strong>Yes</strong> only if both the following conditions are true:
<ul>
<li>The underlying table is a valid time state table.</li>
<li>The view has <strong>ValidFrom</strong> and <strong>ValidTo</strong> in its <strong>Fields</strong> list.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Visible</td>
<td>Specify the access rights when the table is used as a data source on a page or a report. If the table is used as a data source on a page, the access rights on the page can't exceed the access rights that are defined for the table.</td>
</tr>

## Data set properties
This section contains descriptions of the properties on data set elements in Application Explorer. The **Data Sets** node is a high-level node in Application Explorer. Data sets are used to access data in Enterprise Portal.

### Description of properties

The following table describes the properties that are available on data set nodes in Application Explorer.

| Property | Description                   |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Name     | Set the name of the data set. |

### Data Sources properties

The following table describes the properties for the **Data Sources** node of the data set.

<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ChangeGroupMode</td>
<td>Specify how changes to the data sources are committed. The following options are available:
<ul>
<li><strong>None </strong>– The changes to any data source for the data set are committed independently of changes to the other data sources.</li>
<li><strong>ImplicitInnerOuter </strong>– All the data sources that are inner-joined or outer-joined work as a single unit. All changes are committed successfully, or they are rolled back if an error occurs.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Data set data source properties
The following table describes the properties that are available for data set data sources.

<table>

<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AllowCheck</td>
<td>Specify whether security checks occur before the data set is accessed. The following options are available:
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes </strong>– The user's read permissions are verified before the data set is accessed.</li>
<li><strong>No </strong>– The user's read permissions are verified only after the data set is accessed. No data is retrieved if the user lacks sufficient permission for the underlying data sources.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Yes</strong> is the default value and is usually recommended.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>AllowCreate</td>
<td>Specify whether users can create new records in the data source (that is, in the table for the data source).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AllowDelete</td>
<td>Specify whether users can delete records in the data source (that is, in the table for the data source).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>AllowEdit</td>
<td>Specify whether users can modify the data. <strong>Tip:</strong> You can set the <strong>AllowEdit</strong> property for the whole data source here. The same property also exists on each field in the data source, so that you can prohibit modifications for individual fields.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AutoNotify</td>
<td>This property isn't used for data sets.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>AutoQuery</td>
<td>This property isn't used for data sets.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AutoSearch</td>
<td>This property isn't used for data sets.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CounterField</td>
<td>Specify one of the fields in the data source as a counter for the data set. The field must be an index on the underlying table for the data source, and it must be of the <strong>real</strong> type. This property helps guarantee that a record that is inserted in a data set has a line number that corresponds to the actual sequential position in the data. For example, if a new line is inserted between lines 3 and 4, the new line becomes line number 3.5.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>CrossCompanyAutoQuery</td>
<td>Specify whether the data source retrieves data from more than one company database.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>DelayActive</td>
<td>Use this property to delay execution of the active method for the data source. If you set this property to <strong>Yes</strong>, the active method is activated only after a delay of 20 milliseconds. When a user scrolls through a data source, the active method isn't called on every record. Instead. it's called only on the final record that the user selects. <strong>Tip:</strong> The <strong>DelayActive </strong>property is particularly useful when two data sources are linked (that is, when the <strong>LinkType</strong> property is set to <strong>Delayed</strong>). This property is part of the AutoJoin system.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Index</td>
<td>Set the index that is used to specify a sorting order. You can choose any of the indexes on the table. If you specify an index in this manner, it's used as an index hint on each query to the database. The index specifies both an access path and a sort order for the records in the data set, based on this data source. The initial sort order for the records is prioritized in this manner:
<ol>
<li>If sort fields are added to the data source query, the sort specification is used.</li>
<li>If an index is specified in the <strong>Index</strong> property on the data source, the sort order that is implicitly specified in that index is used.</li>
<li>If the data source is autojoined with another data source, the system finds the most appropriate index for this join and then sorts the data according to that index.</li>
<li>If nothing else is specified, the sort order that is implicitly specified in the first index (the index that has the lowest ID) on the table that is used in the page data source is used.</li>
</ol>
When no index hints are specified, the database management system locates an applicable access path. This access path is based on the information in the query that is supplied. The user can change the sort order for a page by using the query dialog box.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>InsertAtEnd</td>
<td>Specify whether a new record is created when the user moves focus past the last record in the table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>InsertIfEmpty</td>
<td>Specify whether a blank record is inserted if there are no records in the table. If you set this property to <strong>No</strong>, you must manually create a new record.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>JoinSource</td>
<td>Use this property to join two data sources. Set this property when two or more tables are used as the data source, and you want to join them.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>LinkType</td>
<td>Use this property to maintain an active link between two data sources. When focus changes in the first data source, the corresponding record or records in the second data source are selected. For example, a customer table and a table of transactions is used for each customer. When the user scroll from one customer to the next, the transaction list is automatically updated to show transactions for the current customer. Set this property to <strong>Delayed</strong> for the outer (externally linked) data source. The linked data source is updated only after a delay of 100 milliseconds. This delay helps guarantee that the linked data source isn't updated while the user is scrolling through a data source. The update occurs only after the user finally focuses on a record. This property is part of the AutoJoin system.</td>

## Form properties
This section describes the properties that you set on forms in Application Explorer. To provide a uniform application interface, many properties have **Auto** values. You can create forms by using a drag-and-drop operation and then manually setting several properties. To specify the name of a form, you set the **Name** property in the **Properties** window for the form. All other properties on the top-level node for the form are system properties and are read-only.

## Form design properties
Most properties on the **Design** node for a form also exist on the individual controls. Examples include the **Width** and **Height** properties. However, when you set a property on the **Design** node instead of setting it on a control, the setting affects the whole form. A few properties exist only on the **Design** node. The following table describes these properties.

<table>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AlignChild</td>
<td>Specify whether a control within a group follows the <strong>AlignChildren</strong> property setting for the group or for the overall form design. For example, <strong>AlignChildren</strong> is set to <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>Design</strong> node for the form, but you don't want a particular group to be arranged together with the other groups. In this case, set <strong>AlignChild</strong> to <strong>No</strong> for that group.</td>

<li><strong>Restricted </strong>– Users can change properties of individual controls, but they can't move controls.</li>
<li><strong>Yes </strong>– There are no restrictions on the user setup.</li>
</ul>
The default value is <strong>Yes</strong>. <strong>Caution:</strong> Full user setup isn't allowed if any of the parent containers for the control have restrictions on the user setup level.

For example, a customer is selected in one form, and the control opens a form that shows customer transactions. In this case, the second form shows a range of customer transactions that apply to the current customer. <strong>Caution:</strong> If you set the <strong>DataSource</strong> and <strong>DataField</strong> properties, their settings override any settings for the <strong>DataMethod</strong> or <strong>ExtendedDataType</strong> properties.</td>

## Help document set properties
A document set is a collection of Help documentation that is associated with a workspace. When you publish a content element, you use metadata to add your content element or table of contents information to a document set. To manage the relationship between a workspace and a document set, Application Explorer includes a node that is named **Help Document Sets**. Each document set in the **Help Document Sets** node includes a collection of properties. You edit these properties when you add a new document set or change the relationship between a document set and a workspace. **Caution:** A workspace can be associated with only one document set. Although Application Explorer lets you add a new document set and associate it with a workspace, you will no longer see documentation from the document set that you replaced. Typically, you use **UserDocumentation** as the document set for any content element or table of contents entries that you publish to the Help server. The following table describes the properties for a document set in the **Help Document Sets** node of Application Explorer.

## Query properties
Within a query, you can set properties on the query itself, the data sources, the fields that are used for sorting, and the ranges that are used to delimit the query.

### Query properties

Query properties determine the overall behavior of the query. For example, you can specify the form that is shown to users so that they can interact with the query.

## Security code permission properties
A code permission is a group of permissions that are associated with a menu item or a service operation. When a security role has access to a menu item, it also has access to other Application Explorer items that are mentioned within the code permission for that menu item. The degree of access is controlled by the specific permissions that are defined under the code permission node.

### Securable objects

Code permissions are used to give access to securable objects. The following list shows the hierarchy of code permission nodes in Application Explorer:

-   Security
    -   Code Permissions
        -   YourCodePermission
            -   Tables
            -   Server Methods
            -   Associated Objects
                -   Forms
                -   Web Controls
                -   Reports

Code permissions can also override the access levels to securable objects under the **Associated Objects** node.

### Code permission properties

## Security duty properties
Security permissions are combined into privileges, and privileges are combined into duties. Duties are defined as groups of related privileges that provide a user with access to a specific business function. In Application Explorer, these privileges are organized into the nodes of a duty.

### Best practices

This section describes the best practice rules for duties.

-   All duties should be assigned to a role.
-   All duties should be part of a process cycle.
-   Because a duty represents a specific business function, the name of the duty should rarely or never change. For example, your company pays bills. Although the details of how you pay bills might change, the essential function of paying bills won't change. Instead of creating a new duty, you should change the privilege subnodes of the duty.
-   The name of a process cycle should rarely or never change.

### Duty hierarchy in Application Explorer

The following list shows the hierarchy of duty nodes in Application Explorer:

-   Security
    -   Duties
        -   YourDuty
            -   Privileges

### Duty properties

</tbody>
</table>

## Security privilege properties
A privilege is a group of permissions. The nodes that are below each privilege node identify the securable objects that a user can access and set the level of access for each object.

### Best practices

This section describes the best practice rules for privileges.

-   You can use privileges to specify the access that is required in order to perform a job.
-   You can use privileges to group the permissions for related securable objects. For example, menu items and their controls are closely related.
-   You can assign privileges directly to security roles. However, security settings are easier to maintain if you assign duties or process cycles instead of privileges.

### Securable objects

Privileges are used to give access to securable objects. The following list shows the hierarchy under the **Security** &gt; **Privileges** node in Application Explorer:

-   Security
    -   Privileges
        -   YourPrivilege
            -   Entry Points
            -   Permissions
                -   Tables
                -   Server Methods
                -   Forms

Privileges can also override the access levels to securable objects as they are defined elsewhere in Application Explorer. For example, a privilege can override a permission that is defined by the **EffectiveAccess** property under **Forms** &gt; **YourForm** &gt; **Permissions** &gt; **Update** &gt; **Tables** &gt; **YourTable** in Application Explorer.

For the <strong>ServiceOperation</strong> object type, the following options are available:
<ul>
<li><strong>Invoke</strong> – The server method can be called.</li>
<li><strong>NoAccess</strong> – The server method can't be called.</li>

## Security process cycle properties
A process cycle is a group of duties. A process cycle represents a high-level job function. Although the details of how a given job function is run might change over time, the concept and name of that job function probably don't change.

### Best practices

This section describes the best practice rules for process cycles.

-   Each duty should be part of a process cycle.
-   Use a process cycle to organize a group of duties for a job function.

### Process cycle hierarchy in Application Explorer

## Security policy properties
Developers and system administrators can create security policies to deny access to a subset of data records in tables.

### Constrained tables of a policy

You can add tables and views under the **Constrained Tables** node of a security policy in Application Explorer. These tables and views are related to the data source table of the query that is named in the **Query** property of the policy. The following list shows the hierarchy of security policy nodes in Application Explorer:

-   Security
    -   Policies
        -   YourPolicy

</table>

## Security role properties
Roles represent a collection of permissions that can be granted to users. The nodes that are nested below each role node identify various securable objects that a user can access and specify the level of access.

### Role node in Application Explorer

Roles are used to give access to securable objects. The following list shows the hierarchy of role nodes in Application Explorer:

-   Security
    -   Roles
        -   YourRole
            -   Duties
            -   Privileges
            -   Permissions
                -   Tables
                -   Forms
                -   Server Methods
            -   Sub Roles

Roles are typically associated with security duties, and sometimes with security privileges. Access levels to securable objects within a role are derived from the duties, privileges, or both. Roles can also override the access levels to securable objects under the **Permissions** node.
