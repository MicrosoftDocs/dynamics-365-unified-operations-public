### AIF, AxD, and AxBC integrations

In Application Integration Framework (AIF), data can be exchanged with external systems through business logic that is exposed as services. Dynamics AX includes services that are based on documents and .NET Business Connector (AxBC). A document is created by using XML. The XML includes header information that is added to create a *message* that can be transferred into or out of Dynamics AX. Examples of documents include sales orders and purchase orders. However, almost any entity, such as a customer, can be represented by a document. Services that are based on documents use the **Axd &lt;*Document*&gt;** classes.

|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | The architecture of AIF and AxDs could not be scaled to a cloud service. There were performance issues around bulk import.                                                                               |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | In the current version of Dynamics AX, this feature is replaced by the Data Import/Export framework, which supports recurring bulk import/export. For AxBC, we recommend that you use the actual tables. |

### BOMs without BOM versions

When the **BOM versions** configuration key was disabled, bill of materials (BOM) versions were hidden in all forms, and the system forced a 1:1 relationship between released products and BOMs. In the current version of Dynamics AX, the **BOM versions** configuration key can't be disabled.

|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Cue groups were used to display one or more Cues in the FactBox area. There was limited uptake, and there were also performance concerns, because a record change in a parent form caused one query per Cue in the Cue group. |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | No                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Cue metadata was limited to count or sum information.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | Tile metadata was introduced to provide more flexibility for modeling. For example, you can model current counts, navigation, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Count tile metadata is the direct replacement of the Cue metadata. |

### Data partitions

Data partitions provide a logical separation of data in the Microsoft Dynamics AX database.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Data partitions were introduced in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 to enable data isolation. In a common scenario, a company has subsidiaries, and the data from one subsidiary should not be visible to another subsidiary, even though both subsidiaries are managed by the same IT department. However, extra scripts and management overhead throughout the program were required in order to create new partitions and populate them with data, and to back up partition data. In the cloud, where we have access to platform as a service (PaaS) database services (Microsoft Azure SQL Database), it's much more efficient to use a database as the isolation container than to do isolation in the program. Regardless of whether data partitioning is required for subsidiaries, for multiple tenants, or just for scale, we believe that the scenarios can be handled better through multiple databases or multiple Dynamics AX instances. |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | Data partitions will be replaced through support for multiple databases or Dynamics AX instances in a future release.    |
| **Modules affected**             | All  |

### Database and file share storage for attachments
Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 allowed storage of attachments in the database and in file shares. Both of those options are no longer supported.

|                              |                                        |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Files share storage is no longer supported because cloud-hosted environments cannot communicate with local file shares. Database storage has been deprecated in favor of Azure Blob storage. Azure Blob storage is equivalent to storage in the database, as documents can only be accessed through Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations client forms. This provides the added benefit of providing storage that doesn't negatively affect the performance of the database. Blob storage is the default storage mechanism for Document Management and works immediately. |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | Database storage has been deprecated in favor of Azure Blob storage.       |

|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | The Dynamics AX client experience has been redesigned to improve usability across multiple platforms and devices.                      |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | The new web client is based on the desktop Form metadata and programming model that have been modified to provide a rich web platform. |
| **Modules affected**             | All                                                                                                                                    |

### Direct database connection

In Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Retail Modern POS could connect directly to the Channel DB in similar fashion to Enterprise POS. This was in addition to the standard communication method of Retail Modern POS communicating through Retail Server.  

|                              |                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Direct database connectivity required lower security protocols and was primarily used to achieve the highest levels of performance. Due to the performance and security enhancements that have occurred in Finance and Operations, this functionality now causes more issues than it solves. |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | No. Only standard Retail Server communication is now supported.    |

|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Generic functionality is now used instead of localized functionality.                                                                                                                                                                 |

|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | Product builder exposed X++ code to end users and isn't supported in the current version of Dynamics AX. It has been removed to avoid duplicate maintenance efforts on overlapping, sizeable codebases. |

### Virtual company accounts

The virtual companies feature is no longer supported in Dynamics AX. The virtual companies feature let users set up tables that could be shared by a set of companies. For a description of the feature, see [Company accounts and Virtual company accounts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa834382(v=ax.10).aspx). The feature works by grouping tables into collections that are assigned to virtual companies, which are groups of existing “real” companies. Queries are created so that all the companies in the virtual company can access the data in the tables of the associated table collections.

<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />

</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><b>Reason for deprecation</b></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Virtual companies must be set up before data is stored in the tables. Retrofitting virtual companies onto an existing implementation is very difficult.</li>
<li>Because there has been so much data normalization in the current version of Dynamics AX, it has become difficult to know what to add to the table collections. For example, it's difficult to know which tables to share. All the tables referenced from tables that are in a virtual company must also be added. Because of table normalization, even simple master data that is spread across multiple tables must be part of the virtual company. Any mistake that is made here will cause functional issues.</li>
<li>When a table is part of a virtual company, it loses information about the origin of the data, and only the virtual company is recorded.</li>
