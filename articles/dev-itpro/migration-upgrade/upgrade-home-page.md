# Upgrade home page

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When we discuss upgrade, we can be talking about anything from moving to new product version upgrades, code migration and upgrade, moving to an update, or deploying a hotfix. 

The processes for each type of upgrade are similar, but different enough that we think that you should review the topics for a specific task before you begin.

## Upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition

To get started, review the following topics:

- [Overview of upgrade from AX 2012 to Finance and Operations](upgrade-overview-2012.md)

- [Prepare to migrate code from AX 2012 to Finance and Operations](prepare-migration.md)
