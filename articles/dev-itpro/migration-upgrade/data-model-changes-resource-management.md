| ResCalendarCapacity           | This is a data denormalized table based on **WorkCalendarTable**, **WorkCalendarDate**, and **WorkCalendarDateLine** to calculate resource capacity. The calculation is based on the resource associated calendar date line definition, which is specified in the **WorkCalendarDataLine** table. The data in this table can be generated by running the **Synchronize resource capacity roll-ups** batch job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ResRollUpCalendar             | This is a data denormalized table based on **ResCalendarCapacity**. The data in this table is used by the **ResRollUpWriter** class to speed up the process of adding resource records to the **ResRollup** table. The data in this table can be generated by running the **Synchronize resource capacity roll-ups** batch job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ResRollUp                     | This is a data denormalized table based on **ResBooking**, **ResAssignment**, and **ResRollUpCalendar** for performance improvement. This table contains all of the capacity and reservation data for time scales, including Day, Week, Month, Quarter, and Half year, for all resources. This data is accessed by the **AvailabilityView** control, which is included with any resource scheduling X++ form that includes this control, like the **Resource availability** form. The data in this table can be generated by running the **Synchronize resource capacity roll-ups** batch job. Data is updated for every resource reservation action such as adding a new resource, booking, assignment, and reservation cancellation. |

| ResourceView                    | This view is based on **ResResourceIdentifier**, which is only based on **ResResourceWorkCenterView**. In a future release it can be extended to more than **ResResourceWorkCenterView** if a resource record will be saved on more than just **ResResourceWorkCenterView**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ResourceWorkerView              | This view replaces the **HcmWorker** table, which is based on **ResResourceIdentifier**. **WrkCtrTable** has a worker field which is a Foreign Key to **HcmWorkerTable**. This view includes all **WrkCtrTable** resource which worker field is not 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ResourceLegalEntityView         | This view replaces the **HcmEmployment** table. This is the resource legal entity (LE) view, which is a union of **ResourceWorkerLegalEntityView** and **ResourceOtherLegalEntityView**. The purpose of this view is to look up the resource legal entity as well as the associated valid from and valid to date. For example, an **HcmWorker** resource can be hired by multiple LEs with different ValidFrom and ValidTo dates. If the worker is hired by multiple LEs, then this worker resource will have multiple records in this view. If the resource is not a **HcmWorker**, then this resource will have only one record and **validFrom** = **minDate** and **ValidTo** = **maxDate**.                                                      |
| ResourceCalendarView            | This view replaces **WorkCalendarTable**. This view contains the calendar **RecId** of the resource. This is a union view of **ResourceWorkerCalendarView**, R**esourceOtherCalendarView**, and **ResourceGroupResourceCalendarView**. To look up the resource calendar, users should first look up the **ResourceLegalEntityview**. This is because a resource should have a different calendar depending on the resource’s legal entity. First, locate the record from **ResourceLegalEntityView** and get the **RefRecId** and **RefTableId** fields. Then, look up **ResourceCalendarView** by setting **ResourceLegalEntityRefRecId** = **ResourceLegalView.RefRecId** and R**esourceLegalEntityRefTableId** = **ResourceLegalView.RefTableId**. |
| ResourceCategoryView            | This view shows the resource category (the resource role for a worker resource), which is based on the **PSASchedRole** table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Changes that will affect tables and fields
==========================================

These sections contain information regarding code changes to tables and fields that are part of the feature implementation related to Project resource scheduling.

## Resource scheduling
The table **PSASchedEmplReservation** is no longer used to store a resource’s reservations. Instead, reservations are stored in the **ResAssignment** and **ResBooking **tables. Both tables use the **Activity resource** field Foreign Key for **PSAProjSchedRole.RecId** to store a resource’s reservation. The **PSAProjSchedRole** table is the project team table that has the **Resource** field Foreign Key to **ResourceView.RecId** and the **ResourceLegalEntity** field Foreign Key to **CompanyInfo.RecId** to identify which resources are the project’s or quotation’s team members. If the **PSAProjSchedRole.Resource** field = 0, then this activity resource is a planned resource. A planned resource is a shadow resource that is not backed by an actual resource. **PSAProjSchedRole.ResourceCategory** is a Foreign Key to **PSASchedRole** that stores the role of this team member. The **ResourceResourceCategorySetup** table stores the default time effective resource/role association. However, the resource can be reserved to any role defined by **PSAProjSchedRole.ResourceCategory,** ignoring the default role definition on the **ResourceResourceCategorySetup** table. Regarding WBS versioning, the tables **ProjPlanVersions** and **ProjPlanVersionDetails** store the WBS tasks versions. Initially, all WBS task data will be stored on these tables while the user is editing the WBS tasks content. After the user clicks the **Publish** button, the task data will be pushed to the original hierarchy tables (**smmActivities** and **PSAActivitySetup**). The resource management feature requires data in the original hierarchy tables and requires a published WBS.

## Price by resource and resource category
The pricing tables, **ProjCostPriceExpense**, **ProjCostSalesPrice**, and **ProjRevenueSalesPrice** have a Foreign Key from **ResourceView.RecId**. The tables **ProjHourCostPrice**, **ProjHourSalesPrice**, and **ProjTransferPrice** have a Foreign Key from **ResourceView.RecId**. The field **ResourceCategory** is part of the Foreign Key for **ResourceCategoryView.RecId**. This is done so that pricing is based on a resource instead of a worker and enables pricing setup by resource category.

## Common methods to get resource field and lookup resources
There are several resource methods in the **ResourceFacade** class. The following table includes some of the most common methods.
