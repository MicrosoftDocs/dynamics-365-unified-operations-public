# Create a deployable package of your models in order to apply it to a runtime environment

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An AOT package is a deployment and compilation unit of one or more models that can be applied to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations environment, or a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail environment. It includes model metadata, binaries, reports and other associated resources. One or more AOT packages can be packaged into a deployable package, which is the vehicle used for deployment of code (and customizations) on demo, sandbox and production environments. This article guides you through the process of creating and applying a deployable package. 

## Overview of the process

In order to deploy your code and customizations to a runtime environment (Demo, Sandbox or Production), you must create deployable packages of your solution or implementation. Deployable packages can be created using the **Visual Studio dev tools**, or by the **build automation process** that are available on build environments. These deployable packages are referred to as Application Deployable Packages or AOT Deployable Packages. The image below is an overview of the process. Once a deployable package is created, it must be uploaded to the LCS project's asset library. An administrator can then go to the LCS environment page and apply the package to a runtime environment using the **Maintain &gt; Apply updates** tool.

> [!NOTE]
> Application Deployable Packages do not contain source code.

## Create a deployable package
After you have completed the development stage, follow these steps to create a deployable package from Visual Studio.

1.  In Microsoft Visual Studio, select **Dynamics 365** &gt; **Deploy** &gt; **Create Deployment Package**.

2.  Select the packages that contain your models, and then select a location in which to create the deployable package.

3.  After a deployable package is created, sign in to Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), and then, in your LCS project, click the **Asset Library** tile.

4.  Upload the deployable package that you created earlier.

## Apply a deployable package
To apply a deployable package to an environment, see the article [Apply a deployable package](apply-deployable-package-system.md).
