# Export a database

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to export a database for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations from a sandbox user acceptance testing (UAT) environment to the Asset library.

## Self-service export database

[!include [dbmovement-export](../includes/dbmovement-export.md)]

### Export operation failure

If the export operation isn't successful, you can do a *rollback*. If you select the **Rollback** option after the initial failure of the operation, your source sandbox environment is restored to the state that it was in before the export began.

To determine the root cause of the failure, download the runbook logs by using the available buttons before you start the rollback operation.

### Data elements that aren't exported

When you export a database backup from an environment, some elements of the database aren't exported in the backup file. Here are some examples:

* Email addresses in the LogisticsElectronicAddress table
* Batch job history in the BatchJobHistory, BatchHistory, and BatchConstraintHistory tables
* SMTP password in the SysEmailSMTPPassword table
* SMTP Relay server in the SysEmailParameters table
* Print Management settings in the PrintMgmtSettings and PrintMgmtDocInstance tables
* Environment-specific records in the SysServerConfig, SysServerSessions, SysCorpNetPrinters, SysClientSessions, BatchServerConfig, and BatchServerGroup tables
* Document attachments in the DocuValue table

Additionally, all users except the admin are disabled, and all batch jobs are set to a status of **Withhold**.

### Known issues

#### Export ran for some time and then reached a "Preparation failed" state

The export process can time out on Azure SQL Database when large databases are involved. In some cases, the export process can be recovered by using the **Resume** action from LCS. The Lifecycle Services team is working to identify known error codes, so these can be added to the logs for the export database operation to help guide users toward a resolution. These known error codes will be added in a future release of LCS. If you encounter an issue, you can export manually by following the related section below.

#### Export doesn't show any progress in LCS

The export process differs from other database movement operations and the general package deployment in that it doesn't use a runbook. Therefore, the progress indicator in LCS doesn't show any output, as it would typically show in other scenarios. The Lifecycle Services team is working to identify known error codes, so these can be added to the logs for the export database operation to help guide users toward a resolution. These known error codes will be added in a future release of LCS. If you encounter an issue, you can export manually by following the related section below.

## Manual Export

Encrypted and environment-specific values can't be imported into a new environment. After you've completed the import, you must re-enter some data from your source environment in your target environment.

### Document the values of encrypted fields

Because of a technical limitation that is related to the certificate that is used for data encryption, values that are stored in encrypted fields in a database will be unreadable after that database is imported into a new environment. Therefore, after an import, you must manually delete and re-enter values that are stored in encrypted fields. New values that are entered in encrypted fields after an import will be readable. The following fields are affected. The field names are given in Table.Field format.

| Field name                                               | Where to set the value |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| CreditCardAccountSetup.SecureMerchantProperties          | Select **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Payments setup** &gt; **Payment services**. |
| ExchangeRateProviderConfigurationDetails.Value           | Select **General ledger** &gt; **Currencies** &gt; **Configure exchange rate providers**. |
| FiscalEstablishment\_BR.ConsumerEFDocCsc                 | Select **Organization administration** &gt; **Fiscal establishments** &gt; **Fiscal establishments**. |
| FiscalEstablishmentStaging.CSC                           | This field is used by the Data Import/Export Framework (DIXF). |
| HcmPersonIdentificationNumber.PersonIdentificationNumber | Select **Human resources** &gt; **Workers** &gt; **Workers**. On the **Worker** tab, in the **Personal information** group, select **Identification numbers**. |
| HcmWorkerActionHire.PersonIdentificationNumber           | This field has been obsolete since Microsoft Dynamics AX 7.0 (February 2016). It was previously in the **All worker actions** form (**Human resources** &gt; **Workers** &gt; **Actions** &gt; **All worker actions**). |
| SysEmailSMTPPassword.Password                            | Select **System administration** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Email parameters**. |
| SysOAuthUserTokens.EncryptedAccessToken                  | This field is used internally by AOS. It can be ignored. |
| SysOAuthUserTokens.EncryptedRefreshToken                 | This field is used internally by AOS. It can be ignored. |

### If you're running Retail components, document encrypted and environment-specific values

The values on the following pages are either environment-specific or encrypted in the database. Therefore, all the imported values will be incorrect.

- Payments services (**Accounts receivable** &gt; **Payments setup** &gt; **Payments services**)
- Hardware profiles (**Retail and commerce** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **POS profiles** &gt; **Hardware profiles**)

### Create a copy of the source database

Because you must turn off change tracking and delete database users before you can export the source Azure SQL database, you should create a copy of that database. You can then work with the copy instead of deleting information from the original database. The following SQL statement creates a copy of the axdb\_mySourceDatabaseToCopy database and names it **MyNewCopy**. Edit this script so that it uses the names of your databases.

```
CREATE DATABASE MyNewCopy AS COPY OF axdb_mySourceDatabaseToCopy
```

This SQL statement runs asynchronously. In other words, although it appears to be completed after one minute, it actually continues to run in the background. For more information, see [CREATE DATABASE (Azure SQL Database)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn268335.aspx). To monitor the progress of the copy operation, run the following query against the MASTER database in the same instance.

```
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_database_copies
```

> [!WARNING] 
> Retaining copies of the database for an extended period is not allowed in any Finance and Operations environment. Microsoft reserves the right to delete any copies of the database older than 7 days without any prior notice.

### Prepare the database

Run the following script against the copy of the database to turn off change tracking, and to remove SQL Database users and a system view. The script also corrects system flags, removes references to the previous environment, withholds batches, and removes email configuration. All these changes are required for a successful export and import of the database. These changes also help guarantee that, when the AOS computer is started in the target environment, nothing automatically starts to run.

> [!NOTE]
> You must edit the following **ALTER DATABASE** command so that it uses the name of your database copy.

```

### Export the database

Open a **Command Prompt** window and run the following commands.

```
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DAC\bin

SqlPackage.exe /a:export /ssn:<server>.database.windows.net /sdn:<database to export> /tf:D:\Exportedbacpac\my.bacpac /p:CommandTimeout=2400 /p:VerifyFullTextDocumentTypesSupported=false /sp:<SQL password> /su:<sql user>
```

Here is an explanation of the parameters:

- **ssn (source server name)** – The name of the Azure SQL Database server to export from.
- **sdn (source database name)** – The name of the database to export.
- **tf (target file)** – The path and name of the file to export to.
- **sp (source password)** – The SQL password for the source SQL Server.
- **su (source user)** – The SQL user name for the source SQL Server. We recommend that you use the **sqladmin** user. This user is created on every Finance and Operations SQL instance during deployment. You can retrieve the password for this user from your project in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

After the export is completed, run the following command to delete the database copy.

```
DROP DATABASE [MyNewCopy]
```
