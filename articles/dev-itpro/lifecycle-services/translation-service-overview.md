# Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Translation Service overview

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Translation Service (DTS) is designed to enhance the translation experience for partners and ISVs with their solutions or when adding a new language for [supported Dynamics products](./translation-service-overview.md#supported-products).  

DTS uses a custom-trained machine translation (MT) system for [Microsoft’s General Availability (GA) languages](./use-translation-service.md#glossary) to maximize the quality of the translation output. DTS also supports translation recycling from Microsoft Dynamics and partners/ISVs linguistic assets so that identical strings are translated one time and consistently. 

The following diagram shows a high-level view of how the service works. ![alt text](./media/dts-overview.png "How the DTS works")
 
## Recycle existing translations
Recycling existing linguistic assets is enabled only when the assets are uploaded in the XLIFF translation memory (TM) zip file format. For more information, see [XLIFF TM zip file](./use-translation-service.md#xliff-tm).

## Custom-trained MT system
DTS uses Microsoft Translator Hub (MT Hub) from Microsoft Research to customize the MT system for Microsoft Dynamics products.
The use of the custom-trained MT system is limited to Microsoft’s Dynamics GA languages unless partners and ISVs upload XLIFF TM files that contain more than 10,000 translation units (TU). A TU typically contains a source string, translation, state, state qualifier, and note. In those cases, DTS will create a custom-trained MT that is specific to the request. 

## Supported products
DTS currently supports the following product versions.
