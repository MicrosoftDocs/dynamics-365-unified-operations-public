# Lifecycle Services for Finance and Operations partners

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article explains how partners can get started with Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). 

As a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations partner, you can access the current version  by following the steps in [Sign up for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations subscription](../dev-tools/sign-up-preview-subscription.md).

### Projects for partners in LCS

After you sign up for the current version of Finance and Operations as a partner, you can create two types of projects:

-   Prospective presales
-   Migrate, create solutions, and learn Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations

#### Prospective presales project

Work with new prospects to help them understand the business processes that are available in Finance and Operations, and to help them evaluate their subscription needs. Note that only partners can provision a new Finance and Operations cloud environment. ![Prospective presales project](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/27-1024x514.png)

#### Migrate, create solutions, and learn Finance and Operationsproject

Create a Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 project workspace. You can use the project to support the upgrade from Dynamics AX 2012 to the current version of Finance and Operations. You can also use the project to learn how to use the current version of Finance and Operations or create solutions in Microsoft Dynamics AX Lifecycle Services (LCS).

### Projects for customers in LCS

For every customer who signs up for LCS, an Implementation project workspace is automatically created during the sign-up process. As a partner, you can't create an Implementation project. For more information about the Implementation project workspace, see [How Lifecycle Services for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations works (LCS)](lcs-works-lcs.md). Services within project workspaces behave in the same manner. However, an important difference between an Implementation project and other project types is the ability to configure the current version of Finance and Operations, which is managed by Microsoft.
