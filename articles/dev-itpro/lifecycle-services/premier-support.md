This topic shows how Microsoft Premier customers can submit a support incident for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition by using Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

   - To do so, from the **Submitted to Microsoft** tab, click the **Manage support plans** button.
