# What's new in Lifecycle Services

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]




Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services provides a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and their partners can use to manage Microsoft Dynamics AX projects from pre-sales to implementation and operations. Based on the phase of your project and the industry that you are working in, the site provides checklists and tools that help you manage the project. The site also provides a dashboard, so that you have a single location from which you can obtain up-to-date project information. Go to the Lifecycle Services [site](https://lcs.dynamics.com/en/). Read the documentation: [Lifecycle Services for Microsoft Dynamics User Guide (LCS)](lcs-user-guide.md) For more detailed information about Lifecycle Services releases, see the release posts on Lifecycle Services [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/lcs/).

## September 2016
The Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services team is happy to announce the immediate availability of the September release of Lifecycle Services. **NEW FEATURES** **Combined packages flow through LCS** In the September LCS release, you can now combine a maximum of 3 deployable packages into a single package that can then be deployed on the environment of your choice. This change significantly reduce the downtime resulting from the application of these packages. The following steps provide information about how to deploy the packages.

1.  Select the packages to include in the combined package, and the click **Merge**.
    -   Note: There are restrictions on the packages that can be included as part of a combined package.
        -   Only one package of each type can be selected. For example, you can only select one binary package, 1 application package, and 1 Retail package.
        -   Any packages selected for the combined package must be valid.
        -   A combined package cannot contain a combined package.

2.  In the slider that opens, enter a name and description for the new package, and then click **Confirm**. Before you can use your combined package, LCS must complete the process of merging the packages you selected into a new package. After the combined package is ready, the **Additional details** pane will show information about the package.Specifically, you can view information about:
    -   The packages used to create the combined package
    -   The service models and modules included in the combined package
    -   The validation status

    When the combined package is ready, it can be applied to an environment.
3.  On the **Environment details** page, click **Maintain** &gt; **Apply updates**.
4.  When the **Select the change type** slider opens, click **Merged package**. The **Select the Merged package to apply** slider will open. This slider shows all of the combined packages in the project that are ready to be used.
5.  Select the package that you want applied to the environment, and then click **Apply**. **Note:** Even when the child packages for a combined package have been applied on an environment, the combined package will still need to be applied on a sandbox environment. This is so that the combined package can be marked as a Release candidate and the request to apply the package on the Production environment can be made.

**Process Data Packages** When you are consuming process data packages, for example applying data packages associated with business processes, (i.e. applying data packages associated with business processes) to a Dynamics AX environment, you can select multiple packages and apply them concurrently to the destination environment. **Cloud-powered support is now Support** The **Cloud-powered support** tile has been renamed **Support**. This change has been applied to all instances of **Cloud-powered support** in LCS. This change is applicable to LCS projects for all supported Dynamics AX product versions. **Subfolders support for SharePoint Online library organization** In the September LCS release, you can now browse, upload, and download documents from subfolders in a SharePoint document library.

1.  To browse folders, from the **SharePoint Online Library** page, click on the folder name. The subfolders and documents within that folder will be shown.
2.  To download a document, click on the document name.
3.  To upload a document to a subfolder, navigate to the subfolder by clicking the name of the parent folder.

Editing the solution is similar to how you created a solution in a project. 2. Select a project from the list of available projects. We recommend that when you edit a project solution, that you create a new solution creation project. Note that a solution can be opened for edit only once until it is published. If you would to like to collaborate on the editing process, the editing user needs to invite you to the Project. 

[![10](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/10.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/10.png)   [![11](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/112.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/112.png)

When you click **Edit**, the solution will open in edit mode in the project that you selected. 

![12](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/121-1024x508.png)   

Similar to how you created the solution, you can add and delete assets from the solution and you can also add release notes. After you have made the required changes, you can publish the solution. 

[![13](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/13.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/13.png) 

After you publish a new version of solution, all of your customers can access the newest version and the associated release notes from the asset library. 

[![14](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/14.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/14.png) 

A customer project will have a specific version as you can see below. Now the customer can review your release notes and, if they want, they can get the latest version of the solution. 

[![15](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/15.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/15.png)

-   Import existing business process from other BPM libraries – Click **Import**, and then drag and drop a business process from a library into your new library.
-   Edit business process details.

Note that your new library will enable you to associate keywords, industries and countries/regions metadata with a business process. **Business process steps** In this release, we have improved the rendering and accuracy of process steps associated with task recordings that are stored in LCS. These updates include:

-   Correcting errors in the chronological order of steps.
-   Rendering of sub-steps in a hierarchical fashion.
-   Not showing hidden steps.

You can also now edit process steps and define sub-steps. For example, to render the following process steps:

## March 2016
The Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services team is happy to announce the immediate availability of the March release of Lifecycle Services. 

**NEW FEATURES** 
**Asset library improvements** 
This is the first wave of updates where we will be enabling multi-select support for a set of operations in the Asset library. At this time, we support multi-select for most of the operations in asset library including Delete, Save to my library, and Mark as release candidate.   

[![1](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/114-1024x458.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/114.png) 

Starting with this update, you can provide descriptions for all the assets in the Asset library and the descriptions will be available to all users in LCS who are using the asset you upload.   

**Performance improvements** 
With the March update, we have made significant performance improvements to the LCS.   

**Business Process Modeler (BPM) Localization** 
**Export a BPM library for localization** 
Functionality now enables the localization (translation) of business process lines and task guide steps associated with business process lines.

1.  You can access this functionality by clicking on the **Localization** button in the **Author and Edit** view of you BPM library.

  ![2](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/24.png) 
  
  This will open the **Localization Center.** 
  
  ![3](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/33.png) 
  
  From there you can export your BPM library. After the export process is complete, and the status shows as **Completed,** you can download and extract the .zip file containing the localizable resources. 
  
  ![4](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/43.png) 
  
  The extracted .zip file contains one folder for every locale. If this is the first localization export of this library, you will start with one locale, en-us. 
  
  ![5](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/52.png)   
  
  The locale folder will have one folder for every business process (BP) line in your library which is represented by a numerical identifier. Within  the BP line folder you will find the localizable resource files line.xml and recording\_resources.xml.   
  
  ![6](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/62.png)

-   Line.xml contains the BP line localizable strings.
-   Recording.xml contains the task recording text.
-   Recording\_resources.xml contains the localizable strings of a task recording associated with the current BP line.

  In order to navigate more easily to the desired folder in the BPM library, open the **hiearchymap.html** file in a web browser.   **Import BPM localizations** When you complete your localization activities:

1.  Update the localization.xml file with a new &lt;localization&gt; entry for every language you added.
2.  Zip the localization folder and import it back into LCS using the import button in the **Localization Center**.

If you have edited the title or description of your line after your last export, the import process will show a conflict in the import report and the conflicting lines will not be imported. You can override this behavior and force an import by modifying the &lt;ModifiedDate&gt; of the line in the \_manifest.xml file to a future date. **Work in progress ** After importing BPM localizations, a Dynamics AX client connected to your LCS project will be able to render task guides in the Dynamics AX user interface language. However, the LCS BPM portal does not have this functionality yet. Import functionality is still not available for AX 2012 projects. **Solution creation** Solution creation partners can now create a process data package directly from the Asset library. To start solution creation, click **+**, enter the name and description, and then click confirm. 

![7](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/72.png) 

You can now consume a process data package directly from the Asset library. To start the consume process, click **Consume**. 

![8](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/81.png) 

**Methodology improvements** 
You can clone, or create copies of, an existing phase and the related tasks. 

![9](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/91.png) 

Select the phase that you want to clone and click **Clone selected phase**. 

![10](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/102.png) 

This will create a copy of the selected phase and it’s associated tasks. 

![11](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/115.png)

**Content release** 
We have shipped 2 new **BPM libraries** for the new Dynamics AX.

## January 2016
The Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services team is happy to announce the immediate availability of the January release of Lifecycle Services. 

**NEW FEATURES** 
**Cloud hosted environments** now supports the deployment of Dynamics AX 2012 CU10 for non-demo topologies. 

![1](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/123-1024x515.png) 
LCS is now available in 40 languages. Please refer to the December release notes under **Language preferences** on how to use this new functionality. 

[![2](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/212.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/212.png)

**Configuration manager and Data deployment templates for Dynamics AX 2012** 
A new Configuration section has been added to the **Environment** page. In your LCS project, when you open a Dynamics AX environment page, you can use the **Configuration** tab to deploy data templates on that environment. 
![3](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/310.png) 

Deployment templates are a collection of data processing groups. Data processing groups are defined on a Dynamics AX environment and can be pulled into LCS and then grouped into a deployment template. These deployment templates are stored in the asset library of your LCS project. From the **Configuration** tab on the environment’s page, you can: Deploy an existing template on the current environment. -or- Create a new deployment template by pulling processing groups from the current Dynamics AX environment, and store the template in the **Asset Library**. This new functionality is intended to replace the existing preview version of **Configuration manager** which will be removed. By using deployment templates instead of the configurations used by the **Configuration manager**:

1.  You can control the order in which data entities and data processing groups are applied.
2.  You can edit the content of data templates directly from LCS.

## **GER configuration** 
Microsoft owned configurations for CTP8 were added under the **GER configuration** asset type in the Shared asset library. GER provides one common way (through the LCS Asset library) for Microsoft and partners to distribute electronic document configurations to other partners and customers. GER also makes it easier for partners and customers to customize, upgrade, and distribute electronic document formats for their specific business requirements. 

![4](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/49.png) 

**LCS Administrators** 
With January release of LCS, all existing Office 365 administrators of your Microsoft Dynamics AX tenant will also be LCS administrators. Previously, one specific user was assigned the role of LCS administrator. 

**Business process modeler** 
We have addressed the issue with **Business process modeler** (BPM) search indexing. If you have experienced issues with help content delivery in the newest version of Dynamics AX, this fix helps resolve the issues you have seen. If you have seen the following message in your BPM library, it means that the indexing of the library is pending. 

![5](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/58.png) 

Below is a library that has been successfully indexed. 

![6](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/65.png) 


**Process data package** 
We have made significant performance improvements to the process data package creation experience. New Dynamics AX solutions creators can now add database backups to a solution package.
