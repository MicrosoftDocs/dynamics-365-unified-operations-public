# Security Development Tool (AX 2012)

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]


This topic describes the user interface of the Security Development Tool.

**Note:** This is pre-release documentation of a preliminary nature and is subject to change at any time without notice. Microsoft cannot guarantee the accuracy of any information provided herein.

## Overview of the main form
This section describes the controls in the main form.

### Main form

![Security Development Tool Main form](./media/securitydevelopmenttoolmainform.png)

-   **Type** field – The type of security object: **Role**, **Duty**, or **Privilege**.
-   **Name** field – The label of the selected security object.
-   **Refresh** button – Reload permissions for the security object that is currently selected.
-   Tree view – The main menu view for the rich client, Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, and service operations.

When you select a menu item, web menu item, or service operation, the entry point is selected automatically in the list view. The access level that is shown for a menu is determined by the highest access level that is granted to a submenu item. The order of precedence for access levels, from lowest to highest, is **No Access**, **View**, **Edit**, **Create**, **Correction**, and **Full Control**. For example, in the following figure, if the **All vendors** menu item is granted the **View** access level, and the **Vendors on hold** menu item is granted the **Edit** access level, the parent menus, **Accounts payable**, **Common**, and **Vendors**, are marked with the **Edit** access level.

### Menu access aggregation in tree view

![Security Development Tool Menu Access Aggregation](./media/sdt_menuaggregatedaccesslevel.png) When the level of access to a node in the tree view changes, the node is displayed in bold type. If the level of access to a menu item remains the same, but the level of access to a submenu item changes, the parent menu item is marked with an asterisk (\*). In the following figure, the level of access to **Accounts payable/Setup/Charges/Item charges groups** has been updated from **NoAccess** to **Edit**.

### Changed items

| **Note**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
