# Copy data between Dynamics AX companies (AX 2012)

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]


You can use the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Data Import/Export Framework to copy an entity, such as customers, from one Microsoft Dynamics AX legal entity (company) to another. In this example, we will export customers in a specific customer group from the CEU company to the CEC company in the Contoso data set.

**Note: **This walkthrough is not intended for users of the versions of the Data Import/Export Framework that ship with cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. Those users should refer to the topic [Copying and comparing entity data between companies (DIXF, DMF)](copy-compare-entity-data-between-companies-dixf.md). This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:

-   Define the format of your source data
-   Define a processing group
-   Process data from source to staging
-   Switch companies to copy data to another legal entity
-   Validate the data in staging
-   Validate the data in target

The following diagram illustrates the path that data takes during the export and import processes. [![WalkthroughCopyDataBetweenAXCompanies1](./media/walkthroughcopydatabetweenaxcompanies1.jpg)](./media/walkthroughcopydatabetweenaxcompanies1.jpg)
