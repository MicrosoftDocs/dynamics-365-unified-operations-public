# Business process modeler

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Business process modeler (BPM) in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) is a tool that you can use to create, view, and modify repeatable implementations that are based on business process libraries and flowcharts. BPM helps you align your business processes in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, with industry-standard processes that are described by the [American Productivity &amp; Quality Center (APQC)](http://www.apqc.org/). You can perform fit-gap analysis between your business requirements and the default processes in Finance and Operations. Additionally, you can add new business processes and create flowcharts for processes that aren't already defined in Finance and Operations.

BPM is compatible with the following programs:

- **Microsoft Word** – You can generate documentation for business processes.
- **Microsoft Visio** – You can export business process maps to Visio files.

**Note:** The information in this topic is specific only to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. For information about Business process modeler and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, see [Business process modeler](ax-2012/business-process-modeler-lcs.md). 

## Prerequisites

To effectively use BPM, you must have Microsoft Office 2010 and a Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) project.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to access BPM.

1. Go to [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com/).
2. Sign in, open a project, and then select the **Business process modeler** tile. The **Business process libraries** page has three sections:

    - **My libraries** – This section contains business processes that the user has created or added.
    - **Corporate libraries** – This section contains custom business processes that someone in your organization has uploaded.
    - **Global libraries** – This section contains cross-industry standard business processes.

3. To copy a standard business process library from the **Global libraries** section to the **My libraries** section, select the upper-right corner of the tile in the **Global libraries** section, and then select **Copy**.
4. After the business process library has been added to the **My libraries** section, select the tile to view the business process library.
