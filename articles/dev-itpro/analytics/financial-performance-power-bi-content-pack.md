# Financial performance Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the **Financial performance** Microsoft Power BI content. It describes the dashboard and reports that are included, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.

## Accessing the Power BI content

You can access the **Financial performance** Power BI from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) and from PowerBI.com.

### Available from LCS
The **Financial performance** Power BI content that is available from LCS supports the following versions:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017)
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 

You can find the Power BI content in the Shared asset library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content pack and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md). To watch a demo that shows how to implement the Power BI content, see the [Power BI content from Microsoft and your partners in Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w) Office Mix.

### Available from PowerBI.com
The **Financial performance** Power BI content that is available from PowerBI.com supports Microsoft Dynamics AX versions 7.0 and 7.0.1. For more information about how to connect and load your Dynamics AX data, see [Access Power BI content from PowerBI.com](power-bi-home-page.md).

## Main account setup
Because organizations want liabilities and revenue amounts to appear as positive amounts on reports, the setup of the main accounts is important. For these main accounts to appear as positive amounts, the main account type must be set to **Liability** or **Revenue**. When these account types are used, reporting through Power BI will reverse the signs and show the amounts as positive.

## Dashboard and reports that are included in the Power BI content
The dashboard contains summarized tiles of data that are based on underlying reports. Each tile contains summarized information for the current year across all companies in an organization. Here are some of the tiles:

- Cash
- Total Revenue this year
- Total Expenses this year
- Net Income this year
- Quick Ratio
- Total Expenses this year by account category
- Current Ratio
- Debt to Total Assets
- Actual vs Forecasted Revenue
- Billed Revenue this Year
- Operating expenses Ratio this year
- Profit Margin this year
- Actual vs Budget Expenses – All companies

Each tile is backed by a supporting report. These reports contain both charts and tables that provide more information. The following table describes the reports.

The charts and tiles on all these reports can be filtered and pinned to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure a Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).

## Understanding the data model and entities
The following entities were used as the basis of the **Financial performance** Power BI content:

**Aggregate data entities**

- **GeneralLedgerActivities** – This entity aggregates general ledger balances by account category.
- **BudgetActivities** – This entity aggregates budget balances by account category.

**Data entities**

- FiscalCalendars
- MainAccounts
- LegalEntities
- Ledgers
- ChartofAccounts

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model. The calculated measures are used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content. By default, the content brings in data for the last three years and one future year. To include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can modify the [Microsoft Excel workbook](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/global/AX/downloads/reports/msdaxfinpercontentpowerbi). This workbook is the default data model that was used to create the content. After you've finished making your modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that you’ve added.
