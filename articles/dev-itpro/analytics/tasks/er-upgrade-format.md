# Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can maintain an Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration. This procedure explains how a custom version of a format can be created based on the format received from a configuration provider (CP). It also explains how to adopt a new, base version of that format.



To complete these steps, you must first complete the steps in the “Create a configuration provider and mark it as active” and “Use created format to generate electronic documents for payments” procedures. These steps can be performed in the GBSI company.


## Select format configuration for customization
1. Go to Organization administration > Workspaces > Electronic reporting.
    * In this example, sample company Litware, Inc. (http://www.litware.com) will act as a configuration provider that supports format configurations for electronic payments for a particular country.    Sample company Proseware, Inc. (http://www.proseware.com) will act as a consumer of the format configuration that Litware, Inc. provided. Proseware, Inc. uses formats in certain regions of that country.  
2. Click Reporting configurations.
3. Click Show filters.
4. Apply the following filters: Enter a filter value of "BACS (UK fictitious)" on the "Name" field using the "begins with" filter operator
    * BACS (UK fictitious)  
    * The selected format configuration BACS (UK fictitious) is owned by provider Litware, Inc.  
5. Click Show filters.
6. In the list, find and select the desired record.
    * The version of the format with the status of Completed will be used by Proseware, Inc. for customization.  

## Create a new configuration for your custom format of electronic document
    * Proseware, Inc. received version 1.1 of BACS (UK fictitious) configuration that contains the initial format to generate electronic payment documents from Litware, Inc. in accordance to their service subscription. Proseware, Inc. wants to start using this as a standard for their country but some customization is required to support specific regional requirements. Proseware, Inc. also wants to keep the ability to upgrade a custom format as soon as a new version of it (with changes to support new country-specific requirements) comes from Litware, Inc. and they want to perform this upgrade with the lowest cost.  To do this, Proseware, Inc. needs to create a configuration using the Litware, Inc. configuration BACS (UK fictitious) as a base.  
1. Close the page.
2. Select Proseware, Inc. to make it an active provider.
3. Click Set active.
4. Click Reporting configurations.
5. In the tree, expand 'Payments (simplified model)'.
6. In the tree, select 'Payments (simplified model)\BACS (UK fictitious)'.
    * Select the BACS (UK fictitious) configuration from Litware, Inc.     Proseware, Inc. will use version 1.1 as a base for the custom version.  
7. Click Create configuration to open the drop dialog.
    * This lets you create a new configuration for a custom payment format.  
8. In the New field, enter 'Derive from Name: BACS (UK fictitious), Litware, Inc.'.
    * Select the Derive option to confirm the usage of BACS (UK fictitious) as the base for creating the custom version.  
9. In the Name field, type 'BACS (UK fictitious custom)'.
    * BACS (UK fictitious custom)  
10. In the Description field, type 'BACS vendor payment (UK fictitious custom)'.
    * BACS vendor payment (UK fictitious custom)  
    * The active configuration provider (Proseware, Inc.) is automatically entered here. This provider will be able to maintain this configuration. Other providers can use this configuration, but will not be able to maintain it.

Proseware, Inc. wants to start using it as a standard for the country.  To do this, Proseware, Inc. needs to change the base configuration version for the custom configuration BACS (UK fictitious custom).

Click Apply base value to apply a country-specific limit of 100 characters for vendor’s name text length.  
    * Note that Proseware, Inc. and Litware, Inc. have custom and local versions of this format using IBAN and SWIFT codes with related components that are automatically merged in the managing format.  
2. Click Apply base value.
    * Click Apply base value to apply the country-specific limit of 100 characters for vendor names.
