# Define model mapping and select data sources for electronic reporting (ER)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can select data sources for an Electronic reporting (ER) data model. The data sources will be bound to individual components of the selected data model at design time and populate business data to that data model at run-time. In this example, you will select data sources for an existing data model that has been created for sample company, Litware, Inc.
