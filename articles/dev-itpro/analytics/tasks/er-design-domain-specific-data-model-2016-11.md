# Design a domain-specific data model for electronic reporting (ER)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can create a new Electronic reporting (ER) configuration that contains a data model for electronic payment documents. This data model will later be used as a data source when you create the format of the payment documents.
