# Run the format to do counting and summing for electronic reporting (ER)

[!include[task guide banner](../../includes/task-guide-banner.md)]

The following steps explain how a user assigned to the system administrator or electronic reporting developer role can configure an Electronic reporting (ER) format to do counting and summing based on data of the already generated text output. These steps can be performed in the DEMF company.

To complete these steps, you must first complete the steps in the “ER Configure format to do counting and summing (Part 3: Use computations to make the output)” procedure.

This procedure is for a feature that was added in Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611.
