# Aggregate measurements report

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic points you to a report that lists the aggregate measurements that are available in Finance and Operations.

*Aggregate measurements* can be used to define data entities, called *aggregate data entities,* which can be directly bound to Finance and Operations forms as a data source. Aggregate data entities can also be used to expose data to Power BI and access data programmatically using the AXQuery object. To learn more about aggregate measurements and aggregate data entities, see [In-memory, real-time aggregate models replace SSAS cubes](..\migration-upgrade\in-memory-real-time-aggregate-models.md).

## To view the report
The [Aggregate measurements report](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep) lists each aggregate measurement that is available, along with the measure group, measures, and dimensions associated with the measurement.

## How the report is grouped
The report is a Microsoft Excel file. For large reports, the rows are grouped alphabetically on tab 1. All rows are displayed when you click tab 2. [![GeneratedReports](./media/generatedreports.png)](./media/generatedreports.png)
