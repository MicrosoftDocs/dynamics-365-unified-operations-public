# Benefits Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the **Benefits** Microsoft Power BI content. It explains how to access the reports that are included, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.

## Accessing the Power BI content
The **Benefits** Power BI content is shown in the **Benefits management** workspace if you use one of the following products:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017)
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent

## Reports that are included in the Power BI content
The reports that are included in the **Benefits** Power BI content have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.

| Report                       | Contents                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Benefit Enrollment Overview  | Most and least enrolled plans, enrollment by employee group, and selected benefit plan options |
| Employee Benefits            | Employee enrollment by selected benefit                                                        |
                                                                                             
You can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure A Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).

## Extending the Power BI content
By using the content packs that are available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you can provide great analytics to people who don't sign in to Finance and Operations. You can modify these content packs so that they include other reports or visuals, and then publish the content packs to your Power BI.com tenant for analysis.

You can find the **Benefits** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md). To watch a demo that shows how to implement the Power BI content, see the [Power BI content from Microsoft and your partners in Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w) Office Mix.

>[!NOTE]
>The .pbix files available in Lifecycle Services apply to Finance and Operations only.

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model. These calculated measures are then used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the .pbix file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the content. After you've made modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that youâ€™ve added.
