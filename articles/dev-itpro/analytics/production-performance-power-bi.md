# Production performance Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes what is included in the **Production performance** Microsoft Power BI content. It explains how to access the Power BI reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.

## Overview

The **Production performance** Power BI content is for production managers or individuals in the organization who are responsible for production control.

The reports that are included let you use Power BI to monitor the performance of manufacturing operations with regard to timely execution, quality, and cost. The reports use transactional data from production orders and batch orders, and provide both an aggregate view of company-wide production metrics and a breakdown of metrics by product and resource.

The Power BI content highlights the organization's ability to complete production on time and in full. Future performance is projected based on the production plans. Comprehensive reports provide detailed insights into product defects that are caused by production, and also the defect rates for resources and operations.

This Power BI content also lets you analyze production variances. Production variances are calculated as the difference between estimated cost and realized cost. Production variances are calculated when production orders or batch orders reach **Ended** status.

The **Production performance** Power BI content includes data that originates from production orders and batch orders. The reports don't include data that is related to kanban productions.

## Accessing the Power BI content
If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017), the **Production performance** Power BI content is shown on the **Production performance** page (**Production control** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Production performance analysis** > **Production performance**). 

## Metrics that are included in the Power BI content

The **Production performance** Power BI content includes a set of report pages. Each page consists of a set of metrics that are visualized as charts, tiles, and tables.

The following table provides an overview of the visualizations that are included.

| Report page                                | Charts                                               | Tiles |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Production performance                     | <ul><li>Number of production by date</li><li>Number of productions by product and item group</li><li>Number of planned productions by date</li><li>Bottom 10 products by on-time & in-full</li></ul> | <ul><li>Total orders</li><li>On-time & in full %</li><li>Incomplete %</li><li>Early %</li><li>Late %</li></ul> |

| Defects trend by resource                  | Defect rate (ppm) by quantity processed | |
| Production variances for job order costing | <ul><li>Production variance by date and cost group type</li><li>Production variance by site and cost group type</li><li>Top 10 products with unfavorable production variance</li><li>Top 10 unfavorable production variance by resource</li></ul> | <ul><li>Realized cost</li><li>Production variance</li><li>Production variance %</li></ul> |

## Extending the Power BI content
By using the content packs that are available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you can provide great analytics to people who don't sign in to Microsoft Dynamics 365. You can modify these content packs so that they include other reports or visuals, and then publish the content packs to your Power BI.com tenant for analysis.

You can find the **Production performance** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md). To watch a demo that shows how to implement the Power BI content, see the [Power BI content from Microsoft and your partners in Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w) Office Mix.

Be sure to download the **Production performance** content that applies to the version of Dynamics 365 that you're using.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611, KB 4011327 is a prerequisite for this Power BI content. After you sign in to LCS, you can access the KB at https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/issue/results/?q=kb4011327.

## Understanding the data model and entities

The following data is used for the report pages in the **Production performance** Power BI content. This data is represented as aggregate measurements that are staged in the Entity store. The Entity store is a Microsoft SQL Server database that is optimized for analytics. To learn more about the entity store, see [Power BI integration with Entity Store](power-bi-integration-entity-store.md).

The following table shows the key aggregate measurements that are used as the basis of the Power BI content.

| Entity                   | Key aggregate measurements  | Data source for Finance and Operations | Field              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|

| Total mixed quantity     | SUM('Production order'[Good quantity]) + SUM('Route transactions'[Defective quantity]) |

The following table shows the key dimensions that are used as filters to slice the aggregate measurements, so that you can achieve greater granularity and gain deeper analytical insights.
