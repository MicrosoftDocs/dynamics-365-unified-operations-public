# Employee development Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the **Employee development** Microsoft Power BI content. It explains how to access the reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.

## Accessing the Power BI content

If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017), you can find the **Employee development** content pack in the Shared assets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information about how to download the content pack and connect it to your data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md).

## Reports that are included in the Power BI content
The reports that are included in the **Employee development** Power BI content have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.

| Report                        | Contents |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| Employee Development Overview | Summary of other reports |
| Employee Skill Analysis       | Employee skill types and employee skills by type |
| Employee Skill Level Analysis | Employee skill levels by department, employees by skill level and skill type, and lowest and highest levels per skill |
| Skill Profile                 | Skill profile for the selected employee |
| Skill Analysis                | Skills by type and rating |
| Performance Rating Analysis   | Employees by lowest and highest rating by job, employee ratings by department, employees by rating and position type, and highest and lowest ratings by position  |
| Employee Performance Analysis | Employee ratings for selected rating by manager |

You can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure A Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model. These calculated measures are then used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the Power BI content. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the .pbix file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the Power BI content. After you've made modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that youâ€™ve added.
