# Practice manager Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes what is included in the **Practice manager** Microsoft Power BI content. It explains how to access the Power BI reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that are used to build the content.

## Overview

The **Practice manager** Power BI content was created for practice managers and project managers. It provides key metrics that are related to the projects that the organization is working on. The dashboard gives an overview of the projects and related customers. A report-level filter can be used to report for specific legal entities. This Power BI content pulls data from the project accounting aggregate measurements.

The **Practice manager** Power BI content contains five report pages: one overview page, and four pages that provide details about project costs, revenues, earned value management, and hour metrics that are broken down across various dimensions.

All the amounts in the content are shown in the system currency. You can set the system currency on the **System parameters** page.

## Accessing the Power BI content
If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017), the **Practice manager** Power BI content is shown in the **Project management** workspace.

## Reports that are included in the Power BI content

The following table provides details about the metrics that are found on each report page in the **Practice manager** Power BI content.

| Report page       | Metrics |
|-------------------|---------|
| Projects overview | <ul><li>Created projects</li><li>Estimated projects</li><li>In-process projects</li><li>Number of projects by stage</li><li>Number of projects by city</li><li>Actual revenue by customer</li><li>Budget gross margin by project</li><li>Earned value management overview</li></ul> |
| Cost              | <ul><li>Actual vs. budget cost by month</li><li>Actual vs. budget cost by year</li><li>Actual vs. budget cost by category</li><li>Actual cost by transaction type</li></ul> |
| Revenue           | <ul><li>Actual revenue by month</li><li>Actual revenue by postal code</li><li>Actual vs. budget revenue by category</li><li>Actual revenue by customer industry</li></ul> |
| EVM               | Cost and schedule performance index by project |
| Hours             | <ul><li>Actual billable utilized hours vs. actual billable burden hours vs. budget hours</li><li>Actual billable utilized hours vs. actual billable burden hours by project</li><li>Actual billable utilized hours vs. actual billable burden hours by resource</li><li>Actual billable hours ratio by project</li><li>Actual billable hours ratio by resource</li></ul> |

The charts and tiles on all these reports can be filtered and pinned to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin 
in Power BI, see [Create and configure a dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards/). You can also use the Export underlying data functionality to export the underlying data that is summarized in a visualization.

## Extending the Power BI content
By using the content packs that are available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you can provide great analytics to people who don't sign in to Microsoft Dynamics 365. You can modify these content packs so that they include other reports or visuals, and then publish them to your Power BI.com tenant for analysis. 

You can find the **Practice manager** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md). To watch a demo that shows how to implement the Power BI content, see the [Power BI content from Microsoft and your partners in Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w) Office Mix.

Be sure to download the **Practice manager** content that applies to the version of Dynamics 365 that you're using.

## Understanding the data model and entities

The following data is used to fill the report pages in the **Practice manager** Power BI content. This data is represented as aggregate measurements that are staged in the Entity store. The Entity store is a Microsoft SQL Server database that is optimized for analytics.
