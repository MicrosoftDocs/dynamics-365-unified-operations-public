# Globalization resources

## Local and regional deployments
If your government regulations require data to be stored differently or serviced differently than is required for other countries/regions, there might be country/region requirements you must consider when you deploy Finance and Operations. Consider the following resources that might be relevant to you:

[Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations - operated by 21Vianet in China](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/deployment/china-local-deployment)

## Localization and regulatory features

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations includes functionality for the country/regions documented in the [Product localization and translation availability guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck). This functionality is enabled based on the primary address of the active legal entity. 

This topic includes lists of resources that can help you do the following: 
- Learn more about developing country/region-specific solutions.
- Get country/region specific updates.
- Submit and review regulatory alerts.
- Learn how to use country/region specific functionality.

### Developing localized solutions
The following resources provides guidance and information that can help developers and ISVs who are creating country/region-specific customizations or are creating a solution for a country that Microsoft does not support.
-   [Separate localization models](separate-localization-models.md)
-   [Apply country/region context](apply-country-context.md)
-   [Regulatory certifications](regulatory-certifications.md)
-   [Classify localization features](classify-localization-features.md)
-   [Country Codes - ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)

### Electronic reporting
The Electronic reporting (ER) tool allows you to configure formats for electronic documents in accordance with the legal requirements of various countries/regions. ER lets you manage these formats during their lifecycle. For more information, refer to one of the following topics:

-   [Generate electronic documents and update application data using the Electronic reporting tool](../analytics/generate-electronic-documents-update-application-data.md)

### Task guides
