Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition is customized extensively by partners, value added resellers (VARs), and even some customers. This is a strength of the product that historically has been supported through overlayering of the application code. The move to the cloud with more agile servicing and frequent updates requires a less intrusive customization model, which makes updates less likely to impact custom solutions. This new model is called *extensibility* and will ultimately replace customization by overlayering. 

Extensibility is the only customization framework in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail. Overlayering is not supported.

## Introduction

These introductory topics contain general information about customization, including information on when customization transitions from overlayering to a purely extension-based model. These topics also explain how to log extensibility requests to Microsoft, along with frequently asked questions and answers.

+ [Extensibility requests](extensibility-requests.md) 
+ [FAQ](app-sealing-faq.md) 

## What's new
This section lists the extensibility-related updates that have been made since July 2017.

+ [Extensibility changes for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition (July 2017)](changes-july-2017.md)

## Getting started

Getting started gets you going with building extensions and migrating a current solution, based on overlayered code, to an extension-based solution. This section includes hands on labs that you walk through simple customizations.

+ [Migrate from overlayering to extensions](migrate-overlayer-extension.md)
+ [Customize model elements using extensions (tutorial)](customize-model-elements-extensions.md)
+ [Customization: overlayering and extensions](customization-overlayering-extensions.md)
+ [Customize by overlayering metadata source code (Office Mix)](https://mix.office.com/watch/1ol6ov90jrd4w)

## Extensibility fundamentals

Extensibility fundamentals includes principles and practices for how to make extensions. The guiding principles in these topics discuss how customization must be approached through extensions, including naming guidelines. Additionally, these topics discuss the foundation framework, such as extensions and chain of command.
