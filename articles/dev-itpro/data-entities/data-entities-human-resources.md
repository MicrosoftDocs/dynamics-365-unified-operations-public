**05.1.004 HR - Pay**
If you’re using demo data to import the Pay period data entity, you will encounter errors on most records because inclusive dates are incorrectly defined. Import of child data entities for Pay period will also fail. Demo data will be fixed during Application Update 1 to address this issue.

**05.1.005 HR - Employees**

Before you import employees and contractors, make sure that the Organizational calendar data entity **for all legal entities** was imported. Otherwise, the import will fail on some of the employee records that don’t have an associated calendar per company. There is an existing issue where not all employee records can be exported by using data management. This issue occurs only when no worker calendar is associated with an employee. Therefore, before import, make sure that a worker calendar is associated with every employee. This issue will be fixed during Application Update 1. The steps under 05.1.006 and 05.1.007 will bring in current employees and contractors in the system, together with all associated child records. Your organization should decide how you want to bring in data, and you may use only one import method. For option 1, you use the Worker and Employment data entities. For option 2, you use Employee and Contractor data entities.

-   **Option 1:** If you’re bringing in past and current workers, which include employees and contractors, you can use Worker and then import Employment data entities to bring in data. However, if you use this option, be aware that you won’t be able to bring in data that is associated with workers, such as Employment employee, Employment contractor, Employment details, and Working calendars.
-   **Option 2:** This option will bring in current employees and contractors in the system. The import will bring in data that is associated with workers, such as Employment, Employment details, and Working calendars. However, if you use this option, be aware that you won’t be able to bring in past employees and contractors.

Before you import the Employee and Contractor data entities, make sure that the Calendar and Working times data entities are imported into all available legal entities. When you do data import for the Employee data entity, use the **Batch** option. Do **not** use the **Import Now** option. To use the **Batch** option, click **Import options** &gt; **Import in batch** while you're doing data import in Data management. **Import in batch** is a better option if you have to manage RAM consumption.

**05.1.016 HR - Human resources parameters**

When you import the Human resources parameters data entity, you might receive the following error message: “Document type Note cannot be used for application email templates.” The message likely indicates that the **Note** document type had a group of **file** and a class of **Attach file** on your export file. We allow document types only for the erroring field of class **simple note** and **group note**. If you fix the document types on the export file before import, the import into the company should work.
