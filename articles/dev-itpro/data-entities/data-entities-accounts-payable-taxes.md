**10.1.004 AP – Vendors**

**Note:** To complete the import, you might have to unmap some fields or attributes that are set on the vendor file. All these fields might not be imported yet. Otherwise, those entities can be added to **Vendor attributes** package. Some of the fields and attributes might include **SalesTaxGroupCode**, **DefaultPurchaseSite**, **DefaultProcurementWarehouseID**, and **MultiLineDiscountVendorGroupCode**. If the invoice account is set on the vendors source file, you should unmap the **InvoiceVendorAccountNumber** field the first time that it's imported. Because of the order of the records in the file, the invoice vendor account might not exist at the time of import. After all the vendors are imported, you can map and import the field again. If the **1099** field is set for vendors, open the **1099** page (**Accounts payable** &gt; **Tax 1099** &gt; **1099 fields**) before you import.
