# Find information about standard data entities

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, ships with many default data entities. Data entities are frequently updated, so for documentation, we rely on the data entity templates to indicate which order data entities should be imported in, and on reports for a list of data entities that ship with each release.

## Configuration data packages
Configuration data packages on Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) contain configuration entity spreadsheets. Configuration entity spreadsheets contain best practice data that you can use to create an initial golden build of a Finance and Operations implementation. The data entities in the data packages are also sequenced appropriately using an XML file to help guarantee a successful single-click import of the data. We recommend that you download and review the configuration data packages to understand how we recommend that you order your data imports. For more information, see [Configuration data templates](configuration-data-templates.md) and [Copy configuration data from one company or legal entity to another](copy-configuration.md).

## Data entity reports
Microsoft provides the following reports for data entities, which can be downloaded from [Technical reference reports](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep):

- **Data entities** lists each data entity that is available. The report indicates the data source of the entity and the fields included in the entity. The report also indicates whether the data entity is public.
- **Data entities fields** lists each field in a data entity, and the table that it originates from.
- **Aggregate data entities** lists the aggregate data entities, and the fields that each contains.

You may also find the Tables report of interest--it lists each table, and its table group.
