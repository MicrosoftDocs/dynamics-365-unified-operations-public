# Data entities - Workflow

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article provides a list of the data entities that are available for Workflow.

Available data entities
-----------------------

These entities should be used as a mechanism to move existing and tested workflows between environments. The IDs in these entities aren't intended to be created manually. Because of the length of some fields in the workflow data entities, the target data format must be comma-separated values (CSV). The CSV format can cause issues where preceding zeros (0) appear in some fields if the files are open between export and import. Be aware that some fields in a CSV file might show “151”, for example, whereas the actual value is 00151. Additionally, some fields might be split into different columns because of length.

**02.1.003 WF – Workflow** **- SHARED**

Note: If you’re using demo data, two expressions will fail on import. The failure of these two expressions will cause records to fail in other data entities in this package that depend on the Expression entity.                                     |

Note: Because of a known issue that involves Workflow owners in the demo data, several records will fail on import.
