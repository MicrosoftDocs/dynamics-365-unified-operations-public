# Data entities - Global address book

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This article provides a list of the data entities that are available for Global address book.

Available data entities
-----------------------

**02.1.001 GAB - Teams**

**For Teams:** If user names are associated with **Administrator**, clear the selection of those user names during import. Then reimport the Teams data entity after employees and users have been imported into the system.

| Suggested sequence | Entity name | Area                        | Entity type | Dependency | Comments                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                  | Team types  | Organization administration | Setup       | None       | Categorize teams, and restrict membership to specific groups of people, such as contractors. This entity is part of Organization administration. |
| 2                  | Teams       | Organization administration | Setup       | Team types |                                                                                                                                                  |

**02.1.002 GAB - Post address setup**

If you're using demo data, some Party relationships and Party postal addresses records will fail during import because of known issues that involve those data entities. The specific error will be related to a value for **Expiration** that isn't valid. You might see the same error on your own data set. The People data entity can be used to relate people and parties. This step is optional if your purpose is just to export people from the legal entity and import people into it. However, the Global address book data entity will bring in relationships for vendors, customers, employees, leads, opportunities, contact person, and others.
