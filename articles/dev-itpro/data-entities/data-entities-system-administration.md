Note: Data import can’t contain a record for Guest or axrunner. These users are created at deployment and can’t be updated by the import. If these records are included, the whole entity will fail. If you create your own package with an export from another system, be sure to remove the administrator user from the import file. If you don’t, the information for the administrator user will be imported from the previous installation and may not allow you to log in to the current instance. |
