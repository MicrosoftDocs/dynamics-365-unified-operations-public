# Business events in Microsoft Flow

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include[banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

Business events can be consumed in Microsoft Flow via the Microsoft Finance and Operations connector. The Finance and Operations connector has a trigger that is named **when a business event happens**. This trigger can be used to subscribe to any of the business events that are available in the target instance of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

## Prerequisite

It's important that you understand business events. For more information, see the [Business events](home-page.md) documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The Finance and Operations connector for Microsoft Flow is in preview.
> - The **when a business event happens** trigger works only with Finance and Operations instances that run Platform update 24 or later, because business events aren't available in earlier platform releases.

## Subscribing to business events and unsubscribing from them

After the **when a business event happens** trigger is added to a flow, the following information must be provided:

- **Instance** – Specify the host name of the Finance and Operations instance where business events occur. Environment instances should be available in the provided drop-down menu, but if an environment is not listed it can be entered as a custom value.
- **Category** – Select the category of business events. The **Business event** field then shows the business events in that category.
- **Business event** – The available business events in the selected category.
- **Legal entity** – Specify the legal entity where the business event is being subscribed to. The flow will be triggered when the business event occurs in that legal entity in Finance and Operations. By default, this field is blank and the business event is subscribed to in **all** legal entities.

When the flow is saved, a subscription to the selected business event is added into the environment instance. As part of the subscription process, the required endpoint is set up, and the corresponding business event is activated.

If either the trigger or the flow is deleted or disabled, the business event is automatically unsubscribed from.

Multiple flows can subscribe to the same business event in different legal entities or in the same legal entity.

## Other ways to consume business events in Microsoft Flow

The previous section explains how you can subscribe to business events directly from Microsoft Flow by using the trigger in the Finance and Operations connector. However, you can also consume business events in Microsoft Flow from Microsoft Azure Event Grid, by using the [Event Grid connector for Microsoft Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/azureeventgrid/).

Event Grid might be a viable approach for consuming business events in Microsoft Flow if it's already being used for other integrations in an implementation. If a business event in the same legal entity must trigger multiple flows, you should consider consuming the business event from Event Grid.

This approach is applicable to any messaging or event platform that is used as an endpoint for business events, provided that a connector is available for it in Microsoft Flow.
