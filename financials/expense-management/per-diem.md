# Per diem rules

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
A per diem is an allowance that is paid to a worker who is traveling for work. In **Expense**, you can create per diem rules for 
different traveling situations. Per diem rates can be based on the time of year, the travel location, or both. When you create a 
per diem rule, you can specify that a percentage of the per diem rate will be withheld if a worker receives complimentary meals 
or services. You can also set a minimum and maximum number of hours that the per diem rate can apply to a worker's travel. 

The calculation of a total per diem amount is based on the start dates and end dates that you can set in the **Per diems** page.
