# Travel requisitions

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
A travel requisition is a source document that documents expenses that will be incurred for the purpose of travel. A travel requisition
is submitted for review and can then be used to authorize expenses. 

Your organization may require that a travel requisition be submitted before an employee incurs an expense that is charged to the 
organization. This applies whether the employee is charging expenses to a corporate credit card, spending cash received from a cash 
advance, or incurring out-of-pocket expenses that will be reimbursed by the organization. 

Travel requisitions and policies can be used to help with budget control. For example, if your organization is working on a 
fixed-price project that requires travel, the travel expenses of the project team members must fit within the budget of the project.
Requiring that travel expenses be approved before they are incurred can help make sure that the project stays within budget. 

You can set up policies for travel requisitions from the **Travel requisition** list page.
