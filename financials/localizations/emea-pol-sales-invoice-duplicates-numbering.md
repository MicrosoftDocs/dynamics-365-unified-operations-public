[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


For legal entities in Poland, the Duplicate sales invoice numbering functionality lets users identify and track duplicate sales invoices. This topic provides information about the Duplicate sales invoice numbering functionality, and explains how to duplicate an invoice, delete a duplicate invoice, and print a copy of a duplicate invoice.

For legal entities in Poland, the Duplicate sales invoice numbering functionality lets users identify a duplicate sales invoice, and track the duplicate invoice number and date, and the user who created the duplicate invoice. Users can also delete a duplicate invoice or print a copy of it. This copy that is printed indicates that the invoice is a duplicate. To duplicate an invoice, on the **Invoice journal** page, select the invoice to duplicate, and then click **Duplicate**. On the **Duplicate** page, click **New** to duplicate the selected invoice. After the invoice is duplicated, complete the following fields.
| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Duplicate number       | The number of the duplicate invoice. Duplicate invoice numbers start at 1 and increase sequentially as new records are added. |
| Duplicate invoice date | The date of the duplicate invoice.                                                                                            |
| Created by             | The identifier of the user who duplicated the invoice.                                                                        |

To delete a duplicate invoice, click **Delete**. **Note:** Only the last duplicate invoice can be deleted. To print a duplicate invoice, click **Print** &gt; **Original preview** or **Copy preview**.
