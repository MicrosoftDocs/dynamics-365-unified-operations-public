# Penalties for past due customer payments in France

In France, you can apply a penalty when a customer payment is past due and you can print the lump sum recovery text that displays the penalty amount that must be paid on the invoice, and the due date of the payment. 

What is lump sum recovery text?
-------------------------------

Lump sum recovery text shows the penalty amount and the due date for the payment. The penalty amount is applied if the payment is past the due date. Lump sum recovery text is printed on the customer invoice. You can specify the penalty amount and the currency along with any instructions in the Lump sum recovery text field in the Invoice area on the Form setup form.

## How do I print lump sum recovery text on a customer invoice?
First, you can use the Form setup page to set up the parameters to print lump sum recovery text. Next, you can use the Posting invoice page or the Invoice journal page to print the lump sum recovery text on a customer invoice. For more information, see [Configure and print a lump sum recovery text on a customer invoice](configure-print-lump-sum-recovery-text-customer-invoice.md).

## When do I apply a penalty to a customer payment?
You can apply a penalty on a customer payment when the payment is not received, and it is past the due date.

## What documents is lump sum recovery text printed on?
After you set up the parameter to print lump sum recovery text, it is printed on the following customer documents:

-   Customer invoices
-   Free text invoices
-   Customer proforma invoices
