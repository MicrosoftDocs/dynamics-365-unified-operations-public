# Accounts payable home page

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides an overview of Accounts payable. 

You can enter vendor invoices manually or receive them electronically through a data entity. After the invoices are entered or received,
you can review and approve the invoices by using an invoice approval journal or the **Vendor invoice** page. You can use invoice 
matching, vendor invoice policies, and workflow to automate the review process so that invoices that meet certain criteria are 
automatically approved, and the remaining invoices are flagged for review by an authorized user.

deliveries and destinations, promissory notes, and other types of Accounts payable information.

## Configure vendor payments and settlements

Assign a system-defined payment type, such as Check, Electronic payment, or Promissory note, to any user-defined method of payment. 
Payment types are optional, but they are useful when you validate electronic payments and when you must quickly determine which payment
type a payment uses.
