The Bank management workspace shows information that is related to company bank
accounts. This workspace includes a Summary and Analytics view. The Summary view
shows summary tiles, bank account information, a balance chart, and related
information. The Analytics page uses the capabilities of Microsoft Power BI to
show visuals that are related to bank account balances.

Summary view
============

Summary
-------

The tiles in the Summary section give an overview of your bank accounts, and
quick navigation to the pages you need to go to most often. The bank
reconciliation information is specific to Advanced bank reconciliation
functionality, and will only include information for those bank accounts with
the Advanced bank reconciliation field set to Yes on the bank account page. From
the summary section you are able to import electronic bank files for bank
accounts across all legal entities.

Bank accounts
-------------

Each bank account in the legal entity is represented by a card in the Bank
accounts section. The current balance is available, with a drill down to the
transactions which make up that summary balance amount. The bridged transactions
are any pending transactions that have been posted using bridging functionality,
and have not yet been cleared. The Bridged transactions amount also has a drill
down to the transactions which make up that summary amount. The Pending balance
is the current balance minus the bridged, or pending, transactions.

The card will also show when the bank account was last reconciled. This
information is only shown if the bank account has Advanced bank reconciliation
enabled.

Balance
-------

The Balance chart will show historic balance information for the bank account
selected in the Bank accounts section, or summarized for all bank accounts in
the legal entity. This is available for different periods of time: week, month,
year, 5 years, and full history of the bank account.

The balance chart will show the historic balances in the bank account currency
if you are viewing it for a single selected bank account. The balance chart will
show the historic balances in accounting currency if you are viewing it for all
bank accounts in the legal entity.

Last updated information is shown at the top of the chart. You can refresh the
data as needed.
