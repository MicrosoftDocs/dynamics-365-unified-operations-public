# Overview

The working time calendar enables you to create a calendar with the hours and days that employees work in your organization. Calendars streamline the time off request process by default in the hours or days. When an employee submits a time off request, they don't have tow orry about holidays and closures, that is handled for them through the working time calendar.

## Setting up a working time calendar

Calendars include generation details, the days and hours you want to included, the days of the calendar, working times for those days as well as enrolled employees. 

To set up a calendar, follow these steps:

1. On the Organization Administration page, click Calendars
2. Select New from the action pane and enter a name and description
3. Choose the work days for your organization and enter work time
4. Add Holidays and closures byy selecting the add button
5. Enter the name and description for the holidays and closures, such as US Holidays or Bank Holidays, then enter the dates for the holidays and closures. Save the Holidays and closures list and close the page.
6. Select the holidays and closures list from the drop down
7. If your employees have non-work time, such as lunches or breaks, add those as well. Select Non-work time and enter the name and time range. Close the page. 
8. Select Add to add the non-work time to your calendar
9. On the Days tab, select Generate to generate the days in your calendar. Enter the date range for the calendar. The days and working times are generated based on teh work days and times defined under the generation options in conjunction with the dates selected.
10. To Assign a calendar to employees, select Assign to employees in teh action pane. Select the employees you'd liek to assign this calendar to and select Assign.

Employees aren't required to have calendars assigned. If there is a working time calendar defined, off days are automatically excluded from the request. The amount, in hours or days, is also defaulted based on the working times defined in the calendar. If an employee doesn't have a calendar assigned, all days are available for time off and teh amount of time off isn't defaulted into the request.
