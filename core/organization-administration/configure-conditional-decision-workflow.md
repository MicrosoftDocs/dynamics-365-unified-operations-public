# Configure a conditional decision in a workflow

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.

A conditional decision is a point at which a workflow divides into two branches. To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** form.

## Name a decision
Follow these steps to enter a name for a conditional decision.
1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.
2.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision.

## Set conditions
The system determines which branch is used by evaluating the submitted document to determine whether it meets specific conditions.
1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.
2.  Click **Add condition**.
3.  Enter a condition.
4.  Enter additional conditions, if they are required.
5.  To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, complete the following steps:
    1.  Click **Test** to open the **Test workflow condition** form.
    2.  Select a record in the **Validate condition** area of the form.
    3.  Click **Test**. The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.
    4.  Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** form.
