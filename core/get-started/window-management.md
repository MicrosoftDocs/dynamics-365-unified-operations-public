# Manage how pages display

This article describes the Open in new window feature that is available in the web client. This feature lets users view the data from multiple pages in a side-by-side format.

In some scenarios, users might find it useful to view the data from multiple pages in a side-by-side format. The web client provides an **Open in new window** feature that enables these scenarios to help users complete their tasks more efficiently. The **Open in new window** button is located next to the **Close** button on the Action Pane. For example, an Accounts receivable clerk who works with sales orders wants to inspect a number of sales orders and the associated sales tax transactions. The user navigates to the list of sales orders and then, on the Action Pane, clicks **Sell** &gt; **Tax** &gt; **Sales tax** to open the **Sales tax transactions** page. The user then clicks **Open in new window**. The **Sales tax transactions** page opens in a new browser window, and the main window shows the list of sales orders again. The user can now keep the two windows side by side. When a new sales order is selected in the main window, the **Sales tax transactions** page in the other window is automatically updated to show the corresponding sales tax transactions. Therefore, the user doesn't have to navigate back and forth between pages.
