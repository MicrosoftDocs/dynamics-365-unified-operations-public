## Blogs
There are many topics about manufacturing and supply chain management on the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/axmfg/">Dynamics AX Manufacturing R&D Team Blog</a> and <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/">Supply Chain Management in Dynamics AX R&D Team Blog </a>.
