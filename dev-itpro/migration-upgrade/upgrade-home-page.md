When we discuss upgrade, we can be talking about anything from moving to new product version upgrades, code migration and upgrade, moving to an update, or deploying a hotfix. 

The processes for each type of upgrade are similar, but different enough that we think that you should review the topics for a specific task before you begin.

[Upgrade from AX 2012 to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](upgrade-overview-2012.md)

[Prepare to migrate code](prepare-migration.md)
