# System requirements

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic lists the system requirements for the current version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, for cloud and on-premises deployments. Before you install Finance and Operations, when appropriate, verify that the system that you're working with meets or exceeds the minimum network, hardware, and software requirements.


## Supported Microsoft Office applications
These follwoing Office applications are suppored in the cloud and on-premises deployments of Finance and Operations.
-   To run the Microsoft Excel and Word add-ins, you must have Microsoft Office 2016 for Windows or Mac installed. For more details about version requirements, see [Office integration troubleshooting](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/office-integration/office-integration-troubleshooting).
-   To view documents that are generated by the Export to Excel or Export to Word functionality, you must have Microsoft Office 2007 or later installed.

# System requirements specific to cloud deployments
## Network requirements
-   Dynamics 365 for Operations is designed for networks with latency of 250-300 milliseconds (ms) or less. This is the latency from a browser client to the Microsoft Azure data center that hosts Dynamics 365 for Operations. We recommend that you test network latency at <http://www.azurespeed.com>.
-   Bandwidth requirements for Dynamics 365 for Operations depend on your scenario. Most typical scenarios require a bandwidth of more than 50 kilobytes per second (KBps). However, for scenarios that have high payload requirements, such as workspaces or scenarios that involve extensive customization, more bandwidth is recommended.

In general, Dynamics 365 for Operations is optimized for the Internet. The number of round trips from a browser client to the Azure data center is very small, and the whole payload is compressed. 

**Warning:** Don't compute bandwidth requirements from a client location by multiplying the number of users by the minimum bandwidth requirements. The concurrent usage of a given location is very difficult to calculate. For customers who are concerned about bandwidth requirements, use a preview version of Dynamics 365 for Operations.

## .NET Framework requirements
Dynamics 365 for Operations requires .NET Framework version 4.6.2 for all click-once applications, such as the document routing agent. For installation instructions, see [Installing the .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5a4x27ek(v=vs.110).aspx).

## Supported web browsers

## Requirements for development on local VMs
For information about the requirements for development on local virtual machines (VMs), see [VM running on-premises](../dev-tools/access-instances.md).

# System requirements for on-premises deployments

## Network requirements
Finance and Operations (on-premises) can work on networks that use Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). Consider the network environment when you plan your system and use the following guidelines.

### Network response time
The following table lists the minimum network requirements for the connection between the web browser and Application Object Server (AOS), and for the connection between AOS and the database in an on-premises system.

| Value     | Web browser to AOS | AOS to database                                            |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bandwidth | 50 KBps per user   | 100 MBps                                                   |
| Latency   | < 250-300 ms       | < 1 ms (LAN only). AOS and database need to be co-located. |

- Finance and Operations (on-premises) is designed for networks that have a latency of 250–300 milliseconds (ms) or less. This latency is the latency from a browser client to the data center that hosts Finance and Operations.
- Bandwidth requirements for Finance and Operations (on-premises) depend on your scenario. Typical scenarios require a bandwidth of more than 50 kilobytes per second (KBps) between the browser and the Finance and Operations server. However, for scenarios that have high payload requirements, such as workspaces or scenarios that involve extensive customization, higher bandwidth is recommended and depends on use.
Deployments where the AOS and the SQL Server Database are in different data centers are not supported. The AOS and the SQL Server database need to be co-located. 
In general, Finance and Operations is optimized to reduce browser-to-server round trips. The number of round trips from a browser client to the data center is either zero or one for each user interaction, and the payload is compressed.
**Warning:** Do not calculate bandwidth requirements from a client location by multiplying the number of users by the minimum bandwidth requirements. The concurrent usage of a given location is very difficult to calculate. We suggest using a real-life simulation against a non-production environment of Finance and Operations as the best gauge of performance for your specific case. 
### LAN environments
In local area network (LAN) environments, Microsoft Remote Desktop in Microsoft Windows Server is not required to connect to Finance and Operations. However, it might be required for servicing operations on the VMs that make up the server deployments.
### WAN environments
In wide area network (WAN) environments, Remote Desktop in Windows Server is not required to connect to Finance and Operations.

### Internet connectivity requirements
Finance and Operations (on-premises) does not require Internet connectivity from end user work stations. However, some features will not be available without Internet connectivity.

| Browser client | An intranet scenario without Internet connectivity is a design point for the on-premises deployment option. Some features that require cloud services will not be available, such as Help and Task guide libraries in LCS. |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server         | The AOS or Service Fabric tier must be able to communicate with LCS. The on-premises browser-based client does not require Internet access.                                                                                |
| Telemetry      | Telemetry data might be lost if there are long interruptions in connectivity. Interruptions in connectivity to LCS do not affect the on-premises application functionality.                                                |
| LCS            | Connectivity to LCS is required for deployment, code deployment, and servicing operations.                                                                                                                                 |
## Telemetry data transfer to the cloud
Most telemetry is stored locally and can be accessed by using Event Viewer in Microsoft Windows. A small subset of telemetry events is transferred to the Microsoft telemetry pipeline in the cloud for diagnostics. Customer data and end user identifiable data are not part of the telemetry sent to Microsoft. VM names are sent to Microsoft to aid in environment management and diagnostics from the LCS portal.

## Domain requirements
Consider the following domain requirements when you install Finance and Operations (on-premises):

- Virtual machines that host Finance and Operations (on-premises) components must belong to an Active Directory Domain. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) must be configured in native mode.
- Virtual Machines that run Finance and Operations (on-premises) components must have access to each other configured in Active Directory Domain Services. 
- The domain controller must run on Microsoft Windows Server 2016.

## Hardware requirements
This section describes the hardware that is required to run Finance and Operations (on-premises).
Based on the system configuration, data composition, and the applications and features that you decide to use, the actual hardware requirements will vary. Here are some of the factors that could affect the choice of appropriate hardware for Finance and Operations (on-premises):

- The number of transactions per hour.
- The number of concurrent users.

## Minimum infrastructure requirements
Finance and Operations (on-premises) uses Microsoft Azure Service Fabric to host the AOS, Batch, Data management, Management reporter, and Environment orchestrator services. Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) are not hosted in the Service Fabric cluster.
SQL Server must be set up in a high-availability HADRON setup that has at least two nodes for production use.
The following figure shows the minimum recommended number of nodes in your Service Fabric cluster.

[![recommended number of nodes for service fabric cluster](./media/system-reqs-on-premises-01.png)](./media/system-reqs-on-premises-01.png) 

## Processor and RAM requirements
The following table lists the number of processors and the amount of random-access memory (RAM) that are required for each of the roles required to run this deployment option. For more information, read the minimum requirements recommendation for Service Fabric standalone cluster, [Plan and prepare your Service Fabric cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-standalone-deployment-preparation).
**Note:** If other Microsoft software is installed on the same computer, the system must also comply with the hardware requirements for that software. We recommend that you limit other server applications on the same computer as AOS to 1 gigabyte (GB) of RAM.

**Sizing by role and topology type**

| Topology   | Role (node type)              | Recommended processor cores | Recommended memory (GB) |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Production | AOS, Data management, Batch   | 8                           | 24                      |
|            | Management Reporter           | 4                           | 16                      |
|            | SQL Server Reporting Services | 4                           | 16                      |
|            | Orchestrator                  | 4                           | 16                      |
| Sandbox    | AOS, Data management, Batch   | 4                           | 24                      |
|            | Management Reporter           | 4                           | 16                      |
|            | SQL Server Reporting Services | 4                           | 16                      |
|            | Orchestrator                  | 4                           | 16                      |

**Minimum sizing estimates for production and sandbox deployments***

| Topology                                  | Role                          | Number of instances |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Production                                | AOS (Data management, Batch)  | 3                   |
|                                           | Management Reporter           | 2                   |
|                                           | SQL Server Reporting Services | 1                   |
|                                           | Orchestrator**                | 3                   |
| Sandbox                                   | AOS, Data management, Batch   | 2                   |
|                                           | Management Reporter           | 1                   |
|                                           | SQL Server Reporting Services | 1                   |
|                                           | Orchestrator                  | 3                   |
| *Summary Production and Sandbox topologies* |                               | 16                  |

*These numbers are being validated by our preview customers and may be adjusted as needed based on that feedback.
**Orchestrator is designated as the primary node type and will be used to run the Service Fabric services as well.

**Backend SQL Server and AD initial estimates**

[![backend SQL server and AD initial estimates](./media/system-reqs-on-premises-02.PNG)](./media/system-reqs-on-premises-02.PNG) 

*SQL Server sizes are highly dependent on workloads. For more information, see the “Hardware sizing for on-premises environments” section.

## Storage

- **AOS** - Finance and Operations (on-premises) will use a Server Message Block (SMB) 3.0 share to store unstructured data. For more information, see [Storage Spaces Direct in Windows Server 2016](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview).
- **SQL** – Viable options:
    - A highly available solid-state drive (SSD) setup.
    - A storage area network (SAN) optimized for OLTP throughputs.
    - High performance Direct-attached storage (DAS) 
- **SQL and data management IOPS** – The storage for both data management and SQL Server should have at least 2,000 input/output operations per second (IOPS). Production IOPS depends on many factors. For more information, see the “Hardware sizing for on-premises environments” section. 
- **Virtual machine IOPS** – Each virtual machine should have at least 100 write IOPS.

## Virtual host requirements
When you set up the virtual hosts for a Finance and Operations (on-premises) environment, refer to the following guidelines: [Plan and prepare your Service Fabric cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-standalone-deployment-preparation) and [Describing a service fabric cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-cluster-description). Each virtual host should have enough cores for the infrastructure that is being sized. Multiple advanced configurations are possible, where SQL Server resides on physical hardware but everything else is virtualized. If SQL Server is virtualized, the disk subsystem should be a fast SAN or the equivalent. In all cases, make sure that the basic setup of the virtual host is highly available and redundant. In all cases, when virtualization is used, no VM snapshots should be taken.

## Software requirements for all server computers
The following software must be present on a computer before any Finance and Operations (on-premises) components can be installed:

- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 or higher
- Service Fabric
For more information, see [Plan and prepare your Service Fabric cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-standalone-deployment-preparation).

## Supported server operating systems
The following table lists the server operating systems that are supported for Finance and Operations components.

| Operating system                                     | Notes                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Datacenter or Standard | These requirements are for the database and the Service Fabric cluster that hosts AOS. |

## Software requirements for database servers

- Only 64-bit versions of SQL Server 2016 are supported.
- In a production environment, we recommend that you install the latest cumulative update (CU) for the version of SQL Server that you’re using.
- Finance and Operations (on-premises) supports Unicode collations that are case-insensitive, accent-sensitive, kana-sensitive, and width-insensitive. The collation must match the Windows locale of the computers that are running AOS instances. If you’re setting up a new installation, we recommend that you select a Windows collation instead of a SQL Server collation. For more information about how to select a collation for a SQL Server database, see the [SQL Server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/sql-server-technical-documentation).
The following table lists the SQL Server versions that are supported for the Finance and Operations databases. For more information, see the minimum hardware requirements for [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016).
