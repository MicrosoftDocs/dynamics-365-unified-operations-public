# Features not intended for use with on-premises deployments
The following features are not intended for use in on-premises deployments. There are no plans to implement these features in on-premises deployments.

### SSRS Report Viewer control

This feature was used to interact with HTML formatted reports in the Finance and Operations
web client.

|                                  |  |
|----------------------------------|--|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | SQL Reporting Services (SSRS) does not support a report viewer control that is compatible with the on-premises web client.      |
| **Replaced by another feature?** | Reports are rendered as PDF documents by the on-premises service. Use extensions to enable embedded drill-thru links in application reports. |
| **Modules affected**             | All    |

### Document Routing Agent

|                                  |  |
|----------------------------------|--|
| **Reason for deprecation**       | On-premises deployments are hosted on domain authenticated servers. This offers secure, direct access to network printer devices. |
