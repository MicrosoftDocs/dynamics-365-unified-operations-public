# Add a methodology to an LCS solution

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic explains how to create and modify methodologies. It also provides information about the requirements for methodologies.

Methodology requirements
------------------------

The first two phases of your methodology must be the Learn and Consume phases from the LCS Solutions Consumption methodology. Your product description in the Learn phase must be aligned with your business process library, the descriptions or summaries in your marketing material, and the functionality that is supported in the current version of your solution. The Learn phase includes the following tasks:

-   **Product description** – Take advantage of your marketing description by adding it to the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) methodology.
-   **Get an overview** – Include content for your solution, such as information about features, architecture, and more.
-   **How to get help** – Include numbers, contacts, or direct links to your company's website, for people who contribute to building and maintaining the solution.

The Consume phase includes tasks that are required in order to complete Conference room pilot 1 (CRP1). After the Learn and Consume phases, add the steps that are required in order to implement your solution. You can either modify the phases and tasks so that they are aligned with your solution, or use your company’s implementation methodology.

## Create a new methodology
1.  On the LCS home page, click the **Manage methodologies** tile.
2.  Click the **New methodology** button (**+**).
3.  Set values for the fields, and then click **Confirm**.
4.  Create phases and tasks.
5.  Add any linked tools and resources that are required.

## Edit a methodology
1.  On the LCS home page, click the **Manage methodologies** tile.
2.  Select the methodology to edit.
3.  Click the **Edit methodology** (pencil) button, and edit the methodology.

## Edit a project’s methodology
Follow these steps to edit a methodology in a specific project only.

1.  On the project's home page, click the ellipsis (**...**) button above the project phases, and then click **Edit methodology**.
2.  Edit the phases and tasks.
3.  Edit the linked tools and resources, if any changes are required.

## Change a project’s methodology
1.  On the project's home page, click the ellipsis (**...**) button above the project phases, and then click **Change methodology**.
2.  In the dialog box that appears, set the **Do you want to keep the existing phases and tasks?** option. If you set this option to **Yes**, the phases and tasks from the methodology that you select in step 3 are added to the end of the current methodology. If you set the option to **No**, the current methodology is replaced with the methodology that you select in step 3.
3.  Select a methodology to use with your project.
