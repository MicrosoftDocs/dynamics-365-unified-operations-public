# SQL Server Reporting Services reports

This topic points you to a report that lists the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports available in Dynamics AX.

Reports can be defined simply as any visualization of a structured data set. This may include transactional data presented in a tabular layout and advanced graphical views of aggregate information. To account for this broad definition, Dynamics AX offers several tools to produce reports to satisfy complex business requirements. One of these tools is SQL Server Reporting Services. SSRS reports provide the following advantages:

-   Back office document management capabilities including email support, scheduled executions via batches, and print archive functionality.
-   Parameterized views with drill-through navigation to Dynamics AX pages and other reports.
-   Used to produce precision documents for compliance with local regulatory business practices

For more information, see [Create next-generation reporting solutions](create-nextgen-reporting-solutions.md).

## To view the report
The [SQL Server Reporting Services Reports report](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep)lists each report that is available. The report indicates the data set used for the each report, as well as the filters and fields available on each report.

## How the report is grouped
The report is a Microsoft Excel file. For large reports, the rows are grouped alphabetically on tab 1. All rows are displayed when you click tab 2. [![GeneratedReports](./media/generatedreports.png)](./media/generatedreports.png)
