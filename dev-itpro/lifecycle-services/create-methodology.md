# Create or update a methodology (LCS)

Lifecycle Services (LCS) for Microsoft Dynamics provides methodologies that you can use to ensure a more repeatable and predictable implementation project experience. You can use one of the provided methodologies or create your own. With a methodology, you can easily track and report on your progress.

A methodology consists of phases, tasks, and milestones. Each phase can have any number of tasks, some of which are mandatory. When all of the tasks in a phase are completed, the phase can be marked as complete. You can also create a milestone for when you anticipate a phase to be completed. The following methodologies are included in an LCS project:

-   Implementation
-   Sure Step
-   Learn development
-   Migrate and create solutions
-   Consume solutions

**Note:** There is a known limitation where new changes that are published to the Microsoft Methodology are not pushed to existing projects. Only new projects get these changes.

Add or update methodologies
===========================

A partner or a project administrator can create new methodologies or make changes to an existing methodology for their organization or within the scope of a specific project. These additions and changes can be made at the project level or at the organization level. Use the following procedures to create and save a new methodology, update existing methodologies, and when appropriate, promote a new methodology or methodology changes to the organization level.

## Create a new methodology
1.  On the Lifecycle Services dashboard, on the right side of the screen, click **Manage methodologies**.
2.  On the **Manage methodologies **page, click the plus sign (+).
3.  In the **New methodology** pane, enter a name and description for the new methodology. Click **Confirm**.
4.  **Optional:** After you have confirmed the methodology, you can promote it to the organization level by selecting the methodology in the grid, and then selecting **Promote**. [![promotemethodology](./media/promotemethodology-1024x506.jpg)](./media/promotemethodology.jpg) **Note:** You must be an admin in your organization to promote a methodology to the organization level.

## Change or update a methodology
There are two ways to make changes to a methodology. You can append an existing methodology or you can make changes to a methodology in the scope of a project. From the LCS project dashboard, select the methodology that you want to update, and then select **Edit methodology** or **Append methodology**. [![projectlevelmethodology](./media/projectlevelmethodology-1024x494.jpg)](./media/projectlevelmethodology.jpg) If you select to edit the methodology, you can make the following changes:

-   Add a new phase.
-   Add a new task.
-   Edit a phase or task. (Some phases and tasks can be edited, but others are enforced by Microsoft and are therefore locked and can’t be edited.)
-   Copy a phase or task.
-   Reorder phases and tasks.
-   Delete a phase or task.
