[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic describes the **CFO overview** Microsoft Power BI content. 

## Accessing the Power BI content

If you're using Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update, reports from the **CFO overview** Power BI content are displayed in the **CFO overview** workspace.

## Reports that are included in the Power BI content
The **CFO overview** Power BI content is a composite of reports from other, various content packs, plus some actual and budget balances from General ledger, giving the CFO an overview of the organization. The following table references the content packs from which the reports were copied, a link to the documentation, and the reports that are provided on the CFO overview workspace.

## Extending the Power BI content
You can provide great analytics to those who do not log into Dynamics 365 by using the content packs available in Lifecycle Services (LCS). These content packs can be modified to include other reports or visuals, then published to your Power BI.com tenant for analysis. 

You can find the **CFO overview** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/analytics/power-bi-content-microsoft-partners).
