# CFO overview Power BI content

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic describes the **CFO overview** Microsoft Power BI content. 

## Accessing the Power BI content

If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update, reports from the **CFO overview** Power BI content are shown in the **CFO overview** workspace.

## Reports that are included in the Power BI content
The **CFO overview** Power BI content is a composite of reports from various other Power BI content, together with some actual and budget balances from General ledger. Therefore, this Power BI content gives the chief financial officer (CFO) an overview of the organization.

The following table shows the Power BI content that the reports are copied from and the reports that are provided in the **CFO overview** workspace. Links are provided to the documentation for the various Power BI content.

## Extending the Power BI content
By using the content packs that are available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you can provide great analytics to people who don't sign in to Microsoft Dynamics 365. You can modify these content packs so that they include other reports or visuals, and then publish the content packs to your Power BI.com tenant for analysis.

You can find the **CFO overview** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/power-bi-content-microsoft-partners).
