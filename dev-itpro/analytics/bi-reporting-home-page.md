This topic points you to resources that you can use to learn more about the business intelligence and reporting tools available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. 

## Get started

- [Tech Talk: Reporting options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzZONjKs5xA) (video)


## Analytical workspaces
Finance and Operations delivers interactive reports that seamlessly integrate into application workspaces. By using rich infographics and visuals supported by Power BI (including the large number of controls provided by third parties), workspaces can provide a highly-visual, yet interactive experience for users. 

Users can interact with data by simply clicking or touching visuals on the page. They can see the cause and effect, perform simple what-if operations without leaving the workspace. Thanks to stunning yet interactive visuals, your users will have fun exploring data and discovering hidden trends.

## Business documents and printing
Reporting solutions are often used to capture and communicate the details of business transactions. As such, this requires a reporting solution capable of producing physical manifestations of business data using existing devices like network printers. Example applications of business documents include sales invoice, customer statements, and checks.
