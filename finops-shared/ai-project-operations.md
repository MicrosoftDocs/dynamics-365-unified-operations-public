| Feature | Description | Learn more |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Time Entry Agent (preview) | The Time Entry Agent streamlines time capture by automatically generating draft entries based on project assignments, resource bookings, and historical patterns. This reduces manual effort, eliminates missed submissions, and enhances compliance, enabling organizations to accelerate invoicing cycles and free consultants to focus on higher-value work. | [Time Entry Agent](/dynamics365/project-operations/time/enable-time-entry-agent) |
| Expense Agent (preview) | Streamlines Expense Management by automatically extracting receipt data, generating expense entries, itemizing complex receipts and grouping them to create reports based on a trip or project. End-users can forward receipts to a designated mailbox or click a picture using the mobile app or simply upload them directly into finance and operations apps for the agent to take care of the rest. | [Expense Agent](/dynamics365/project-operations/expense/expense-agent-setup) |
| Approvals Agent (preview) | The purpose of the Approvals Agent is to streamline the approval process for time, expense, and material transactions. The Time and Expense Agent uses a Microsoft Copilot Studio agent to do an initial review of incoming time, expense, and material entries against policy documents that the customer uploaded for each type of entry. If a record meets the criteria that are outlined in the policy document, it's marked as Ready for approval. Otherwise, it's marked as Needs review. This initial review makes the approval process more efficient for project managers. It also helps them avoid time-consuming corrections by reducing mistaken approvals. | [Approvals Agent](/dynamics365/project-operations/approvals/approvals-agent-intro) |
