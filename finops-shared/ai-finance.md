| Account Reconciliation Agent (production ready preview) | Reconciliation of data is a time-consuming process that you often defer until the end of a period. This deferral adds time and headaches to the completion of period end tasks. The subledger to general ledger reconciliation feature changes this process to be proactive rather than reactive when a difference is identified. Use Copilot to notify you of a difference between the subledger and the general ledger, provide options for how to resolve the issue, and eventually resolve the issue on your behalf. Reconciliation is no longer a bottleneck but is always in a continuous state of readiness. | [Generative help and guidance with Copilot](/dynamics365/finance/general-ledger/acct-rec-agent) |
