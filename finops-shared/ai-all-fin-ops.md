You can add Copilot to solutions with finance and operations apps. The finance and operations apps in Dynamics 365 share Copilot capabilities, and there are also app-specific agentive features. This section provides an overview of Copilot and AI agent capabilities in the finance and operations apps.

The following Copilot experiences are available in all finance and operations apps.

- **Generative help and guidance**: Copilot transforms the support experience with a conversational sidecar in finance and operations apps. Users can enter questions or express their needs directly in the app. Learn more at [Generative help and guidance with Copilot](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/copilot/copilot-generative-help).
- **Workflow history summary**: Users can  get an AI-generated summary of the workflow history that they're viewing on the **Workflow history** page. Learn more at [Workflow history summary](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/workflow-history-summary).
- **Enhanced user feedback for Copilot and related experiences**: Users can provide product feedback to Microsoft by selecting thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons.
