## Resources on the SCM blog
The [Supply Chain Management](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/) blog contains several articles about Transportation management. Most of these were written for the previous version of Dynamics 365 for Operations, but the same concepts still apply, and the procedures are similar in the current version. For example, there are posts about:

-   [Third-party Transportation Management (TMS) engines](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/archive/2014/10/08/third-party-transportation-management-tms-engines-ups-fedex-progistics-pcmiler.aspx)

-   [How do I account for freight charges in TMS](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/archive/2015/05/26/how-do-i-account-for-freight-charges-in-tms.aspx)
